1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
OK, let's start.

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, let's continue with the mapping between S-plane and Z-plane.

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, the mapping is based on this transformation, as mentioned last week.

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So, S-domain has variable S, Z-domain has variable Z, so they have this relationship.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now, we consider the case when the frequency is constant.

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So, in S-domain, the imaginary part denotes the frequency.

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So, if the frequency is constant, that means omega is constant.

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And the sigma can be any value between negative infinity and positive infinity.

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:51,000
OK, based on this relationship, as mentioned here, we can find that the angle of Z is t omega.

13
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's this part here.

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So, if omega is a constant with t as the sampling period, then the angle will be fixed.

15
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But the magnitude of Z is changing because sigma is in the range between negative infinity and positive infinity.

16
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
However, it is bigger than or equal to zero.

17
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, when sigma is negative infinity, it's zero.

18
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So, we have this mapping here.

19
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, this is the S-domain graph of constant frequency Lucy.

20
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For example, if your omega is equal to omega one, that means this is a constant.

21
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The angle is straight line parallel to the real axis here.

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Then, the angle corresponding to this straight line will be this, omega one t.

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So, this is the image of j omega one in the Z-plane.

24
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, as I said, this magnitude is changing from zero to infinity.

25
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So, you have this straight line as the mapping of j omega one in the Z-plane.

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Similarly, if you have another straight line like negative j omega one, the angle will be negative omega one t.

27
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So, this is the angle and the straight line would be like this.

28
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
For omega equals omega two, then you have this range.

29
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay, remember we have the concept of primary strip.

30
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So, those omegas should be in the range between negative half omega s and positive half omega s.

31
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,000
In fact, based on sampling theorem, you have this situation also.

32
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Your sampling frequency, omega s is the sampling frequency, should be at least twice of the bandwidth of the signal.

33
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So, that means the range of all the frequencies of the signal considered should be in this range.

34
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay, so that's the case when we have constant frequency.

35
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Now, let's look at an example.

36
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,000
In this example, we are looking for the mapping of this region in the S-plane to the Z-plane.

37
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So, for this region, it's bounded by four straight lines.

38
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Theta equals negative theta one, theta equals negative theta two, and below is negative j omega two, above is j omega one.

39
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, so we found the boundary of these four lines, and then found their mapping in the Z-plane.

40
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
For omega equals omega one, what's the image?

41
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Just now we talked about the image of this horizontal line, it will be this straight line.

42
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay, so if your region is below omega one, yeah, below this straight line, j omega one, then that should be on the right side of this.

43
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So, it's this part of the region in the Z-plane as the image below j omega one.

44
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay, for this horizontal line, negative j omega two, you have this image.

45
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Then, for the region above this horizontal line, it should be on the right side of this line also.

46
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The angle should be bigger than this negative j, negative omega two t, so it's on the right side also.

47
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And now we have two vertical lines.

48
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:42,000
For this left vertical line, the image will be a circle with the radius e to the power of negative sigma one t.

49
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's this circle, centered at the origin.

50
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So, for the region on the left side of this negative sigma one, it should be inside the circle of this, yeah, this big circle.

51
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Now, for this sigma equals negative sigma two, it's also a circle with the radius e to the power of negative sigma two t.

52
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So, the radius is smaller, but this region is on the right side of this vertical line, so the image should be outside this circle.

53
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay, so you consider all the overlapping of the images of all the regions concerned.

54
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We have this shaded area in the z-plane as the image of this shaded area inside the rectangle.

55
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay, so that's how you find the region in the z-plane.

56
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So, basically you find the boundary images and then find the overlapping regions to get the answer.

57
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay, next, we consider constant damping ratio Lucy.

58
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What does this mean?

59
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah, in this case, we have a constant damping ratio.

60
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Actually, damping ratio is an important concept in control system.

61
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So, if you consider secant order system, which means the denominator of the transfer function is secant order.

62
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah, I just considered the denominator.

63
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It will be s squared plus two zeta omega n s plus omega n squared.

64
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay, we have the parameters zeta and omega n.

65
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This zeta is called damping ratio of the system.

66
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Omega n is called the natural frequency of the system.

67
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay, if you find the pole of the system, it will be this.

68
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You have two poles.

69
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
When our damping ratio is between zero and one.

70
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, between zero and one, you have this two complex poles in the complex plane.

71
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah, you can saw this complex poles.

72
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So, one is here, for example.

73
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Then the other one is a conjugate of this pole.

74
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So, if you saw a line from the pole to this origin,

75
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and saw this vertical line and this horizontal line,

76
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
this is the real part, which is negative zeta omega n.

77
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And the imaginary part is this.

78
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
J omega n square root one minus zeta squared.

79
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And you can denote omega d as this.

80
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Just a notation for this part.

81
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So, actually this is omega d.

82
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The imaginary part of the pole is omega d.

83
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
For this case.

84
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay, you can see that the angle here,

85
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
if it's alpha, then your cosine alpha is equal to zeta.

86
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay?

87
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah, you can find this easily.

88
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Actually, the cosine alpha equals this distance divided by this distance.

89
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This distance is zeta omega n, this distance is omega n.

90
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So, the ratio will be zeta.

91
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If zeta is constant, it implies alpha is constant.

92
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So, in the S-plane, yeah, we are considering S-plane,

93
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
for constant damping ratio, it is a straight line, like this.

94
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay?

95
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So, this straight line will give you a constant damping ratio.

96
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah, of course, you have a different real part and the imaginary part.

97
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So, if you treat omega d as a variable,

98
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
then, if your imaginary part is changing,

99
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
then your pole will change along this straight line.

100
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So, we are looking for the image of this red line in the Z-plane.

101
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So, that's the objective of this subsection.

102
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Okay, so now, we are looking for this image with constant damping ratio.

103
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That is, we are looking for the image of this red line.

104
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah, this is the relationship between S and Z.

105
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Now, our S is equal to that.

106
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You just substitute negative zeta omega n plus minus j omega d t.

107
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, times t, you get this.

108
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay, so you do some simplification.

109
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
As I said, we are going to consider omega d as a variable.

110
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So, in this case, we do some manipulation here.

111
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:51,000
This t is equal to 2 pi divided by omega s.

112
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay, that's t.

113
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, because omega s is the sampling frequency in radians per second.

114
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So, that's t will be equal to 2 pi divided by this.

115
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And this omega n, based on this definition,

116
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
it will be equal to omega d divided by square root 1 minus zeta squared.

117
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So, this omega d divided by that is our omega n.

118
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Of course, we have this zeta here.

119
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So, that's the real part of your S.

120
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Now, for the imaginary part, you also change t to 2 pi divided by omega s.

121
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Okay, so this is our manipulation.

122
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Now, based on this, our magnitude of z will be equal to part of this real part.

123
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And the imaginary part, no, the angle will be this part here.

124
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So, it's e to the power of j 2 pi omega d over omega s.

125
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
From this part, you get this angle.

126
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Okay, so 2 pi omega d divided by omega s is the angle.

127
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay, now we have this magnitude and angle.

128
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Now, as I said, I will choose omega d over omega s as a variable.

129
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That is, we consider omega d is changing.

130
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So, if you look at the result here, as this increases,

131
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
as omega d over omega s increases,

132
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:51,000
the magnitude decreases exponentially, but the angle will increase linearly.

133
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Okay, so we have this image for the red line.

134
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So, at the beginning, this red line is the positive half of the two poles.

135
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So, at the beginning, it's this point.

136
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This point has an image at this position.

137
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Then, as this omega d increases, the angle will increase linearly,

138
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
but the magnitude will decrease exponentially.

139
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So, we can see that you get this logarithm spiral, like this.

140
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah, we can see a few important points.

141
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
For example, one omega d over omega s is 0.25.

142
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That means omega d is just one quarter of omega s.

143
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You can compute this angle.

144
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah, this is one quarter, so it's half pi.

145
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Half pi, then, yeah, this angle will be half pi.

146
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If omega d over omega s is a quarter, that's this point.

147
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So, this angle is half pi, but the magnitude is much smaller than this.

148
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It decreases exponentially.

149
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And the one omega d over omega s increases further to half here.

150
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Then, yeah, to half. Actually, it's this, at this point.

151
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Then, your angle here will be, yeah, if this is half, then that will be pi. That's this.

152
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Then, you increase further, you get this.

153
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Eventually, it will converge to zero, because the magnitude converges to zero.

154
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Okay? Yeah, let's look at the case.

155
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If we have zeta as 0.3, yeah, I already mentioned.

156
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:32,000
One omega d, yeah, if zeta is 0.3, you can compute the angle corresponding to this value.

157
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That is omega d over omega s.

158
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's the angle is half pi, as I just mentioned.

159
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But the magnitude with this zeta value is 0.61.

160
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So, that's 0.61.

161
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And if you have, yeah, omega d over omega s is half,

162
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
the magnitude is further reduced to this.

163
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So that's this. You have this magnitude, but the angle is pi.

164
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Okay?

165
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Okay, so that's the image of this red line in the z-plane.

166
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:31,000
However, we should focus our omega in the primary strip.

167
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Which means our omega should be in this range.

168
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Okay?

169
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So, if your omega is in this range, that is between zero and the half omega s,

170
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
then you just have this image up to here.

171
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
This part above the real axis.

172
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yeah, because omega s has an image here.

173
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Okay, so this is the image of this part.

174
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
As I just mentioned, if you have a complex pole, you will have another pole.

175
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What's the other pole? It's the conjugate of this.

176
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So, we have another branch, in fact.

177
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This branch is symmetric to this with respect to the real axis.

178
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So, it's something like this.

179
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So, how do we get the image of this?

180
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah, we have obtained the image of this upper half plane.

181
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's this shape, like this.

182
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Then, how about this?

183
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yeah, you just do a reflection.

184
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Because these two are symmetric with respect to the real axis.

185
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Their image will be also symmetric.

186
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So, overall, for the upper half, it's something like this.

187
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Okay?

188
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Then, for the lower half, you just find them by doing a symmetric mapping.

189
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So, you do a symmetric mapping, you will get something like this.

190
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Okay?

191
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah.

192
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Okay, actually, last week, we considered an example.

193
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I have not finished the example.

194
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah, we are looking for the, if you recall this example, here.

195
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
We have two requirements.

196
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
One is the settling time should be less than equal to four seconds with the two percent error tolerance.

197
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The other is that the dimension ratio should be in this range, between 0.707 and 1.

198
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So, we have this situation.

199
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The dimension ratio is bigger than some value, like this, bigger than 0.707, but less than one.

200
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So, how do we find this image?

201
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah, that's the result here.

202
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So, you have a boundary, zeta equals zeta one.

203
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That's the positive omega side.

204
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
For the conjugate, we have this boundary.

205
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So, for damping ratio bigger than equal to zeta one, it will be the shaded region in S-plane.

206
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Okay, so now, we found the image of the boundary.

207
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So, for this zeta equals zeta one, the image will be like this.

208
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
For the lower half, you have this image, as I just mentioned.

209
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You find this by symmetric image of that.

210
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Okay, so damping ratio bigger than zeta one will be inside the hot shaped region.

211
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So, that's how we get the image of this zeta bigger than zeta one.

212
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Therefore, for this case, you just find the boundary with zeta one as 0.707.

213
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So, you do some calculation, then you have this image as the boundary.

214
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Okay?

215
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah, for zeta bigger than 0.707, it will be the region inside this hot shaped area.

216
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
We have the case when zeta equals one.

217
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What does this mean?

218
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What does this mean?

219
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
If zeta equals one, our pole will be...

220
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah, if you look at the transfer function.

221
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
If zeta equals one, you have two repeated poles.

222
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Both are on the real axis.

223
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I mean, in the s domain.

224
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So, that means, in this case, your pole...

225
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah, two repeated poles will be here.

226
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah, that's the case when zeta equals one.

227
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Okay?

228
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So, we have two repeated poles here.

229
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Then, what's the image of the...

230
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah, in that case, you have to consider the image of the negative real axis.

231
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
What's the image of the negative real axis?

232
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It will be this.

233
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah, because at this point, the image is here.

234
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
When the real part tends to negative infinity, the magnitude will go to zero.

235
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So, the image is just inside the hot shaped region.

236
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That's zeta equals one.

237
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So, to meet the second condition.

238
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah, this condition.

239
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Zeta is bigger than 0.707, less than or equal to one.

240
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Our image will be inside the hot shaped region,

241
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
because zeta equals one is already inside, including the boundary here,

242
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
because it equals 0.707.

243
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Last week, we said to meet the first condition,

244
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
that is the settling time requirement.

245
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
We need our pole inside the unit circle.

246
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
No unit circle.

247
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
No unit circle.

248
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Inside this circle, with the readers, calculated as e to the power of...

249
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah, this is the readers, calculated here.

250
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So, you consider the intersection of the two regions, you get this.

251
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So, that's the required pole locations in the z domain.

252
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So, this completes the solution of the example.

253
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Now, let's consider another example.

254
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You have to specify the region in the z-plane that corresponds to a desirable region,

255
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
shaded in the s-plane here.

256
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So, this region is bounded by two horizontal lines,

257
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and also two straight lines, which corresponds to zeta equals zeta one.

258
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Okay, so this is formed by considering the bound first.

259
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So, for this bound, omega equals omega one, we have this image.

260
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
For omega equals negative omega one, we have this image.

261
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So, for this zeta equals zeta one, we have this heart-shaped figure.

262
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Then, for this region, it will be inside this.

263
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yeah, and the left of this straight line, and also this straight line,

264
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and the inside this heart-shaped region.

265
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh, so we have another bound, zeta equals zeta one.

266
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That means this is negative zeta one here.

267
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Then, the circle is the image of this zeta equals negative zeta one.

268
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So, you consider all these intersections, you get this region.

269
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Okay, so that's how we found the image of the regions in the s-plane.

270
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Okay, so that's the first topic of this chapter.

271
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Next, we consider stability analysis of a closed loop system in the z-plane.

272
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah, stability is an essential requirement.

273
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
When you design your controller, the first thing is to ensure you have a stable system.

274
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:37,000
In linear system, for stability, you have this condition.

275
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
That is, you find the closed loop transfer function first.

276
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Then, the stability is determined by the poles of the system.

277
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
That is the roots of the characteristic equation found from this.

278
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You make the denominator zero, you solve the equation, you get the poles.

279
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So, how do we ensure stability?

280
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You have to ensure all the poles are inside the unit circle.

281
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Okay, so that's the stability.

282
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
In fact, this is also considered as the region of convergence.

283
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Actually, for stability, you don't allow your signal to go to infinity.

284
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah, so that's ensured if all the poles are inside the unit circle.

285
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
If you have one pole outside the unit circle, then if you take an inverse Z-transform,

286
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
the term corresponding to that pole will diverge.

287
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Okay, so to be stable, all roots of the characteristic equation must be inside the unit circle.

288
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Roots outside the unit circle will give you instability.

289
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
How about those poles and the unit circle?

290
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
We have some special cases.

291
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,000
If we have a sample pole at the point Z equals one, then you have critical stability.

292
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
That means your signal does not go to infinity, but does not converge.

293
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It will stay at the unit, yeah, because this is corresponding to the unit step input, so it's a constant.

294
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And if you have a single pair of complex conjugate poles and the unit circle, it's also critical stability.

295
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The signal will oscillate.

296
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Yeah, if you take an inverse Z-transform corresponding to this pair, then you have sine functions.

297
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Yeah, so you have oscillation.

298
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So it's also critical stability because the signal does not go to infinity.

299
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
However, if you have multiple poles at the unit circle, you will have an unstable system.

300
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
For example, you have two poles at Z equals one.

301
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
The corresponding signal will diverge.

302
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
In our case, we just focus on strict stability.

303
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
We have to ensure all the poles inside the unit circle because for critical stability,

304
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:01,000
if we have some uncertainty or disturbance or some perturbation, the system will be likely to be unstable.

305
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So in that case, we don't wish to have such a control system.

306
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Okay, how about the zeros of the transfer function?

307
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Just now, we mentioned the closed loop transfer function is this, right?

308
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
This is how you calculate the closed loop transfer function.

309
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So if you simplify that, you have a numerator.

310
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
The numerator will give you zeros.

311
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
The zeros does not affect stability.

312
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So you don't worry about zeros when you talk about stability.

313
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
However, zeros will affect your response.

314
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay?

315
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So that will affect your trial and response and also steady state performance.

316
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But does not affect stability.

317
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Even if your system is stable, maybe the performance is not good.

318
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So in that case, you have to consider zeros.

319
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Okay, so how do we check stability?

320
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah, one straightforward method is to solve the equation.

321
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah, you solve this equation to find the poles.

322
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
If all the solutions are inside the unit circle, your system is stable.

323
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
However, if you want to solve the equation, especially high-order equations,

324
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
it's very tedious. Sometimes, maybe cannot be solved manually.

325
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So in some cases, we don't have to solve the equation to determine stability.

326
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Because we just need to know whether the poles are inside the unit circle or not.

327
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You don't need to know the exact location.

328
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So we will have a method called jury stability test to check stability.

329
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
In this case, you don't solve the equation.

330
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Okay? So how do we do that?

331
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Let's consider this nth order polynomial.

332
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Suppose this is the denominator of the transfer function.

333
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So we are just considering the denominator.

334
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Don't worry about the numerator.

335
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Assume this is the denominator and we know the coefficients of the polynomial.

336
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
This denominator is a polynomial.

337
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
We know the coefficient will be a0, a1, up to an.

338
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So these are known.

339
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Assume a0 is positive.

340
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Then we are going to check stability of the system.

341
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Before we study the criteria, we talk about jury table.

342
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Jury table is formed in this way.

343
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So I show you the jury table.

344
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
How do we form the jury table?

345
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
We have some procedures.

346
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Okay, for the first row, if you look at the first row of this table,

347
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
it's an up to a0.

348
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So that's the coefficient of pz in the ascending motor of power z.

349
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So an is the constant up to a0, so you put it in the first row.

350
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
How about second row?

351
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Second row, you just reverse the order.

352
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Okay?

353
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So second row is the reverse of the first row.

354
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Actually, for the remaining rows, we also obtain the even rows in the same way.

355
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So now we just want to obtain the outnumbered rows.

356
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
For example, the third row.

357
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
How do we get third row?

358
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
This is the method.

359
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah, the third row contains b values.

360
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So we have to compute b0, b1, up to bn-1.

361
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
How do we obtain these values?

362
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
For example, when k is 0, how do we get b0?

363
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So in this case, you form two by two matrix.

364
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The first column is a and a0.

365
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
That is a and a0.

366
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's the first column of the first two rows.

367
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So that's fixed.

368
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Then the second column, yeah, when k is 0, what do you have here?

369
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's am-1 and the a1.

370
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Where do we get am-1 and a1?

371
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah, when k is 0, so it's am-1.

372
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That's a1.

373
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So you look at the table here.

374
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:19,000
It will be this.

375
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Oh, sorry.

376
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's this.

377
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
These two numbers, am-1 and a1.

378
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah, when k is 0.

379
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So based on these two by two matrix, you completely determine it.

380
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
That will give you b0.

381
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So for b1, you change the second column to this two number.

382
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah, in this case, it's am-2 and a2, if you look at the formula here.

383
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So you have this.

384
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah, this first column is fixed.

385
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
The second column is changed to this.

386
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Then you compute the determinant, you get b1.

387
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Then for next one, you have this column as your second column.

388
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So you just shift the second column in this way.

389
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And finally, for this element, when k is am-1,

390
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
when k is am-1, then this will be a0.

391
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And this is, yeah, k is m-1.

392
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Then m-1 plus 1 is an.

393
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So that's this period.

394
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Okay?

395
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So that's how you form the two by two matrix.

396
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Yeah, maybe for easy to remember, we compute this one first.

397
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You just use this as the first column, this as the second column.

398
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Then you compute the determinant, you get this.

399
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Then for this, you just change these two values to this.

400
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yeah, you have to replace the second column by the previous column here.

401
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Then compute determinant until you have this to get this b0.

402
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Okay?

403
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So you just, to compute this, use this pair.

404
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
This one, you use this pair.

405
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
This one, you use the second pair here.

406
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So that's how we get b.

407
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Once you get b, then you reverse the order.

408
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Yeah, you just reverse the order to get the fourth row.

409
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Okay, for the fifth row, you have to use the previous two rows to do computation.

410
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
This time, you use the same rule.

411
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,000
For example, for this Cm minus two, you also have to use the two by two matrix,

412
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
which is formed by this column and this column.

413
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Then you compute the determinant of this two by two matrix, you get this.

414
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Then for this value, you replace this column by this column here.

415
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Then compute this until C0 here.

416
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
C0, then this will be the second column.

417
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So you can compute the determinant to get C0.

418
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Once you get this C0, you have finished the fifth column.

419
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Then you reverse the order to get the sixth column.

420
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Then you can stop at this here.

421
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
You have a second order in this case.

422
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah, you have three values.

423
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So that's how you get the jury table.

424
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Okay, so this is to form the jury table.

425
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Now, let's consider the stability criteria by jury test.

426
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
We have four conditions for stability of this polynomial.

427
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:21,000
First, the magnitude of An, that is the absolute value of this An should be less than A0.

428
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Remember, we put A0 as positive.

429
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Second condition, you compute P1, that is you let Z be one, you compute P1,

430
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
which is A0 plus A1 up to An. This should be bigger than zero.

431
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Third condition, you compute the P negative one.

432
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Okay, if n is even number, this value should be bigger than zero.

433
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:04,000
If n is odd number, yeah, odd integer, for example three, five, then this value should be negative.

434
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And finally, you will use the jury table.

435
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Okay, for the jury table, you have to compare the absolute value of Bn minus one, which is this value,

436
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
the absolute value of this term, and also the absolute value of B0, the last one.

437
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
This absolute value should be bigger than the absolute value of B0,

438
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
and also for other first common values, until Q2, yeah, this Q2,

439
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
the absolute value should be bigger than the absolute value of Q0.

440
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:54,000
So, if all the four conditions are satisfied, this polynomial will have all the poles,

441
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
all its roots inside the unit circle.

442
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Okay, you don't have to find the exact location.

443
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Based on this, you know all the roots of Pz should be inside the unit circle.

444
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Now, we have a special case.

445
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
For second order system, you only need the first three conditions.

446
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You don't have to form jury table.

447
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
So, in that case, you save lots of calculation.

448
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Okay, let's look at some examples.

449
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Yeah, this is a general fourth order polynomial.

450
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Then, you can have these four conditions found.

451
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah, because that's the first condition.

452
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
This is P1, and that's P-1.

453
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
This should be bigger than zero, because n is a given number.

454
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And also from the jury table, you have these two conditions.

455
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Okay, yeah, in this case, you have a fourth order.

456
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So, you have to form until the fifth row here.

457
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
The middle one is not required.

458
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So, you don't have to compute the C1.

459
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Okay, this is how you form the matrix to compute the determinant,

460
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
so that B3, B2, B1, B0 can be found.

461
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And this is how you form the two by two matrices to compute the C2, C1, and C0.

462
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I said you don't have to compute C1.

463
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Okay, that's for the case when you have a fourth order polynomial.

464
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And let's look at the numerical example.

465
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So, this is a fourth order polynomial.

466
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You check the first condition.

467
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:18,000
A0 is actually one, and this A4 is negative 0.08.

468
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So, its opposite value is 0.08, which is less than one.

469
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
So, first condition is satisfied.

470
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yeah, maybe I put this condition here for easy reference.

471
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Okay, so first condition satisfied.

472
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Now, you compute P1.

473
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Just let Z be one, you do a calculation, that's positive.

474
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So, second condition satisfied.

475
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
You compute P is negative one, so Z is negative one.

476
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Negative one, that will be positive.

477
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
This will also be negative.

478
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yeah, that's negative.

479
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Then you compute this value.

480
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That's bigger than zero.

481
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So, third condition satisfied.

482
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And finally, you form a jury table to compute the B values and also C values.

483
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:26,000
This is how you can compute the B values and the C values.

484
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You just form the two by two matrix, find the determinant to get the B3,

485
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
and this give you B2, this will give you B1.

486
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Then, from the B values, you can get your C2, C1, and C0.

487
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You don't have to compute C1, in fact.

488
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Okay?

489
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
So, all the four conditions are satisfied.

490
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Okay?

491
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Therefore, this polynomial is a stable polynomial.

492
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:16,000
In fact, you can check that the four poles are at 0.8, 0.5, negative 0.5, and 0.4.

493
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah.

494
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Now, let's look at the third order polynomial.

495
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah, in this case, A0 is 1, A1 is negative 1.1, A2 is negative 0.1, A3 is 0.2.

496
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So, based on these four conditions, we check the jury test, check the stability.

497
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
First, condition satisfied.

498
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
That's okay.

499
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Second condition, you compute P1.

500
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
That's zero.

501
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
What does this mean?

502
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
If this is zero, it means one is a solution.

503
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah, because P1 equals zero, that means one satisfies this equation.

504
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So, one is the solution.

505
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So, you have a pole at z equals one, in this case.

506
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Then you compute P1, and this is negative.

507
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
So, this condition is satisfied.

508
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And you also have to check the fourth condition.

509
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
To check the fourth condition, you have to form the jury table.

510
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So, this is the first row.

511
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You reverse the order to get the second row.

512
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Compute P2.

513
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
That's the first P value.

514
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Use this first column and last column.

515
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Compute the determinant.

516
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Get this P2.

517
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Then replace this column by the second last column here.

518
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Compute the determinant.

519
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Get this.

520
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And this is the P0.

521
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
In fact, you don't have to compute P1,

522
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
because you just need to compare the opposite value of P2

523
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
and also the opposite value of P0.

524
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And you can see this condition is also satisfied.

525
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So, what's the conclusion?

526
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Our system is critically stable.

527
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You just have one pole at z equals one.

528
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Two other poles are inside the unit circle.

529
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Okay, now let's consider more examples.

530
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
This is a third-order polynomial.

531
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
We check the four conditions.

532
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
First condition, satisfied.

533
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Second condition, you compute P1.

534
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
When z equals one, you do a calculation,

535
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
and the answer is negative,

536
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
which means this condition is not true.

537
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So what can we say that?

538
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
System is unstable.

539
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Then you don't have to proceed.

540
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yes, you can stop here,

541
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
because this second condition is not satisfied.

542
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Then you say this system is unstable.

543
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
So when you are using jury criteria to check stability,

544
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
you don't form the table.

545
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Like this, you don't have to form the table.

546
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You just check the conditions one by one here.

547
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
First condition, second condition, third condition.

548
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
If all these conditions are satisfied,

549
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
then you form the jury table

550
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and check the fourth condition.

551
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
If one of the conditions like this is not satisfied,

552
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
then you can stop here.

553
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
If one of the conditions like this is not satisfied,

554
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
then you can stop here

555
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
to give your answer about the system stability.

556
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Okay, now let's consider a control system.

557
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Just now, we mentioned this closed-loop system.

558
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Okay, assume the sampling period is one second,

559
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and the open-loop pulse transfer function is this.

560
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Yeah, that is gz equals this value, where k is a constant.

561
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
What's our h in this case?

562
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Actually, h is one.

563
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
How do we know it's one?

564
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Because it says unit feedback.

565
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Nothing means the feedback here is unit feedback.

566
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So h is equal to one.

567
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Okay, now we have to determine the range of k for stability.

568
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Okay, so now we compute the closed-loop pulse transfer function

569
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
using this formula, which is g divided by one plus gh.

570
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I said h is equal to one.

571
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So you just substitute this g into here with h as one.

572
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
After simplification, you get this.

573
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
So that's a second-order system

574
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
because the denominator is a second-order.

575
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And in fact, your a0 is equal to one.

576
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
a1 equals this.

577
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
That's the coefficient of z.

578
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
a2 is the constant term.

579
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
We don't have to check the force condition

580
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
because our system is second-order.

581
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So you don't have to form the jury table.

582
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,000
You just need to consider the first three conditions for this system.

583
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Okay, so we have this first condition.

584
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
a2 magnitude should be less than a0.

585
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
a0 is one, in fact.

586
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
What is a2? a2 is this.

587
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
So this observed value should be less than one.

588
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
p1 should be bigger than zero according to this.

589
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
p-1 also should be bigger than zero

590
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
because n is two, which is even.

591
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Okay, so now based on these three conditions,

592
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
we will have three inequalities.

593
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Yeah, these are the three conditions to be checked.

594
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Now, for the first condition,

595
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
this observed value should be less than one

596
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
because a0 is one.

597
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Then you solve this inequality.

598
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Yeah, I believe you know how to solve this inequality.

599
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
It has this solution.

600
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Yeah, basically you have to remove the absolute sign.

601
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
So that means this term should be bigger than negative one

602
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
but less than one.

603
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So you get this solution for k.

604
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Now p1 should be bigger than zero.

605
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And our p1, yeah, you do a calculation.

606
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
What is p1?

607
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
When z equals one, you can find that it's this value.

608
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Actually, it is just this plus this.

609
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
This implies your k should be positive.

610
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Third condition, p-1, you compute p-1.

611
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So you replace z by negative one, negative one.

612
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Then you do a calculation, you get this.

613
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
That should be positive.

614
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Less than this.

615
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Your k should satisfy the three conditions simultaneously.

616
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So what's your final result?

617
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
You find the overlapping regions.

618
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
That's this.

619
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
So for stability, your k should be bigger than zero

620
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
but less than this.

621
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
So you cannot choose your k obviously.

622
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
That's why when you design your controller,

623
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
you have to be careful about the choice of k.

624
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Actually, when k equals this boundary,

625
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
the system becomes critically stable.

626
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
In this case, the two, yeah, actually,

627
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
this is a second order polynomial.

628
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
You have two poles.

629
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
These two poles will be on the unit circle

630
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
and the pair of, yeah, you solve this equation,

631
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
you get this pair of complex conjugate poles.

632
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
With the sampling period of one second,

633
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
you can find the oscillation frequency from 4.2.

634
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yeah, 4.2 is the one we're considering

635
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
constant damping ratio.

636
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Remember, we have the definition

637
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
of constant damping ratio, omega d here.

638
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Yeah.

639
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
This.

640
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And omega d is the imaginary part.

641
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Here.

642
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Okay?

643
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So that's the frequency of oscillation.

644
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So omega d

645
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
over omega, yeah, omega d times t.

646
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
T is one.

647
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
So the angle of z is your omega d.

648
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
So if you want to find the angle,

649
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
you have to use these two terms.

650
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
You know how to find the angle?

651
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
It's the inverse tangent of the imaginary part

652
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
divided by the real part.

653
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Okay?

654
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So it's this.

655
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
So that's the frequency of oscillation in this case.

656
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Yeah, if your case is this value,

657
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
the feedback system we are considering here

658
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
is not,

659
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
is not,

660
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
the output is not convergent.

661
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
It will oscillate.

662
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And the frequency of oscillation is this.

663
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Okay, so that's about stability

664
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
using jury criteria.

665
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
We have another method to check stability.

666
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
That is to use the

667
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Rouse array approach.

668
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
If you study classical continuous time control system,

669
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
you know what is the Rouse array.

670
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
If you have not studied,

671
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
maybe you don't know this method.

672
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah, basically we will transform our z to w.

673
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Yeah, we define z as this.

674
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Then based on that, w will be equal to this.

675
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Then this transformation

676
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
will map the inside of the unit circle in the z-plane

677
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
into the left half-plane,

678
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
yeah, left side of the w-plane.

679
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
You can prove this.

680
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Assume w has a real part and the imaginary part.

681
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
The real part is sigma, imaginary part is omega.

682
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Then you compute

683
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
the magnitude of z.

684
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Yeah, because later on,

685
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
inside the unit circle means the magnitude of z

686
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
should be less than one.

687
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Okay, z equals that.

688
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Then you do a calculation

689
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
with w changed to that.

690
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Then you do a calculation

691
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
with w changed to that.

692
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Okay, so you compute the magnitude of this

693
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
and this should be less than one.

694
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Actually, here,

695
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
this condition is equivalent to that

696
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
because this is magnitude less than one.

697
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
If we take the square

698
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
of the magnitude, it's also less than one.

699
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Then the square of the magnitude is equal to this

700
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
divided by this, right?

701
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Yeah, the numerator magnitude square

702
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
will be sigma plus one squared

703
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
plus omega squared.

704
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah, that's how you find the magnitude

705
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
of a complex number.

706
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
For the denominator,

707
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
the real part is sigma minus one.

708
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So the magnitude is sigma minus one squared

709
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
plus omega squared.

710
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So if z magnitude is less than one,

711
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
it implies this is also less than one.

712
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Actually, if this is less than one,

713
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
our z magnitude is also less than one.

714
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
So that's sufficient and necessary condition

715
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
for these two cases,

716
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
these two substitutions.

717
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Now, we consider this part

718
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
where you multiply the denominator and both sides.

719
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
This inequality becomes that.

720
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Because the denominator is positive,

721
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
so you don't reverse the sign here.

722
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
So this is the result.

723
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Now you solve this.

724
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Inequality is sigma less than zero.

725
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Based on this proof,

726
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
we can see that z magnitude less than one

727
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
is equivalent to sigma less than one.

728
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
That is, if you have the unit circle in the z-plane,

729
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
the inside of this unit circle is equivalent

730
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,000
to the left side of the w-plane.

731
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
So based on this,

732
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
we can do bilinear transformation

733
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
and then use Routh's stability criteria.

734
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
What do we do?

735
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Just now, we have a polynomial of z.

736
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
So you have Pz.

737
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Then you replace z by this, w plus one over w minus one.

738
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
You do a substitution.

739
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
So you replace your z by this.

740
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
So you replace your z by this.

741
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
What we have is a rational function in this case,

742
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
because this is a rational function here.

743
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
So you substitute this into the polynomial Pz.

744
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Then you get a rational function.

745
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Then you consider the numerator of the rational function.

746
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So this numerator is P prime w.

747
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Then, using this P prime w,

748
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
you can check the stability of the original Pz

749
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
using the continuous Routh's stability criteria.

750
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
That is, we have to ensure the roots of P prime w

751
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
on the left half-plane,

752
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
because we have used this transformation.

753
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
So let's look at an example.

754
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Suppose we have this fourth order polynomial

755
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
studied earlier in example 4.5.

756
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:41,000
So now you just replace this z by w plus one over w minus one.

757
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Then you have lots of calculations involved.

758
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
You have to compute the fourth power of this,

759
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
the third power of this, squared, and this.

760
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Then you do subtraction, addition, and so on.

761
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
After simplification, you get this numerator.

762
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Based on this numerator coefficient,

763
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
you can form a Routh's array like this.

764
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
You should know what is the method of Routh's array

765
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
based on the classical continuous control system.

766
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
So you form the first row

767
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
with the coefficient of the highest power.

768
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
You jump one term and jump one.

769
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
You get one, 59.78, 21.

770
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
For the second row here, that's the second term,

771
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
and then jump one, you get this.

772
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Then based on these two rows,

773
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
you have the row corresponding to w squared,

774
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
and from this you get w1 and w0.

775
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Then you look at the first corner here.

776
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
As you can see, there is no change in the sign.

777
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:07,000
So you have zero root on the right half plane.

778
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
The number of changes in the sign in the first column

779
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
corresponding to the number of roots of your p prime w

780
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
on the right half plane.

781
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
If there is no sign change,

782
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
you have zero root on the right half plane.

783
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So this is a stable system.

784
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
This is a method using our classical control.

785
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
For the two methods, we have some remarks.

786
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Our jury table or jury test

787
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
does not give you the number of roots

788
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
outside the unit circle,

789
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
but the Routh's test will give you the number of roots

790
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
on the right half plane.

791
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
That is the number of unstable roots.

792
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
However, the jury table is easier in calculation

793
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
than our bilinear transformation.

794
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:14,000
For example, the case for the fourth order example,

795
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
you have to substitute this to the polynomial

796
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
and do lots of calculation.

797
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
So this is a very tedious computation.

798
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
This is not required in our examination

799
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
because lots of calculation.

800
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,000
But jury test is definitely required.

801
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Stability has nothing to do with the system's performance.

802
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
That is, how the output tracks the input is not discussed.

803
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Stability is to check whether you have a signal

804
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
that goes to unbounded.

805
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
So now if we want to consider system performance,

806
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
we have two analyses,

807
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
quadrant and steady state analyses.

808
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,000
For quadrant analysis, it is very difficult.

809
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
For second order, it is possible to do analysis manually.

810
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
But for high order system

811
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
and also for advanced control systems,

812
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
normally you will use computational tools such as Matlab.

813
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
We did this previously.

814
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:52,000
We are using Matlab to find the output response.

815
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
But here I just gave you some definitions

816
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
on the quadrant response.

817
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:07,000
The response over a time period from zero to settling time

818
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
is called quadrant response.

819
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
You have overshoot, you have rise time,

820
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
you have settling time like this.

821
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Just previous week, we studied the settling time requirement.

822
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
So this is quadrant response.

823
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,000
You are using computational tool to find such results.

824
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So here we don't consider our calculation manually.

825
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I will study steady state response

826
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
because we can use final value theorem

827
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
to determine our steady state value.

828
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Steady state means your time goes to infinity.

829
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So we have steady state error analysis

830
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,000
as our last part of these four weeks.

831
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Okay, so how do we study steady state error analysis?

832
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
We will use some typical input signals.

833
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
They are called test signals.

834
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
The typical signals are step input, ramp input,

835
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
and the acceleration input.

836
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Also, we have to recall one important concept.

837
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
For continuous time system,

838
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
you have this open loop transfer function.

839
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Open loop means, for example, you have this feedback system.

840
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
That's closed loop.

841
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
That's closed.

842
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Open loop means you've broken the loop.

843
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
So in this case, it's open.

844
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Then you have open loop transfer function.

845
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
For continuous time system, it's Gs times Hs.

846
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
So if the open loop transfer function is like this,

847
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
the number of integrators in the open loop transfer function,

848
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
N, is called the type of system.

849
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Okay, we have this concept.

850
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Now, for discrete time system,

851
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
if we have this open loop transfer function,

852
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
that is, this is open,

853
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
then the open loop is G times H.

854
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Yeah, that's this part here.

855
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Then, if this open loop transfer function is denoted as this,

856
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
we have integrator 1 over Z minus 1 to power N.

857
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
So that means you have also an integrator here.

858
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
This is called the type of discrete time system,

859
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
similar to the continuous time system.

860
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Of course, in this situation,

861
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,000
your Pz and Az shouldn't have the factor of Z minus 1.

862
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Yeah, if your Pz has a factor of this,

863
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
that will cancel out this.

864
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
If your Az has such a factor,

865
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
it should combine with this.

866
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So that's the definition of the type of system.

867
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Okay, now we consider this system

868
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Yeah, this is a typical discrete time control system.

869
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
We have this actual 18-a-root, E t,

870
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
which is R t minus B t.

871
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Yeah, actually this E t is a continuous time signal.

872
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Of course, you can take Z transform

873
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
to obtain E z equal to R z minus B z.

874
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Yeah, for continuous time signal, you have Z transform,

875
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
as I mentioned before.

876
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Okay, so we are looking for the steady state error

877
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
of E t or E kt.

878
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
So based on final value theorem,

879
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,000
the steady state error will be equal to E kt,

880
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
when k tends to infinity.

881
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
That's the definition of steady state error.

882
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Based on final value theorem,

883
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
this is the same as this.

884
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Of course, assume the system is stable.

885
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Yeah, if your system is unstable,

886
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
then you have divergence.

887
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Okay, so this E z is this E z here.

888
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Then you have 1 minus Z inverse times this Z transform of E.

889
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And then take an limit of Z tends to one,

890
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
you get the answer.

891
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Okay, so that's how we find the steady state error.

892
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Okay, now let's consider a few typical case.

893
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Yeah, first, with the input.

894
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
With this input.

895
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Yeah, okay.

896
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Okay.

897
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Yeah, here actually we do some analysis.

898
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
E z equals R z minus B z, as I just mentioned.

899
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Here.

900
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Yeah, that's E z.

901
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
So you do some analysis.

902
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
And this B z equals G H z times E z.

903
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
From the block diagram.

904
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Yeah, that's B t.

905
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
So you have B z here.

906
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
This is the pulse transfer function, you can find out.

907
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Then times E z here.

908
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Okay, G H z times E z.

909
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And how do we find the G H z for this system?

910
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Yeah, we have a zero-order hold.

911
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,000
So you have to use the zero-order hold formula,

912
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
which has this factor, 1 minus Z inverse.

913
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Then times Z transform of G p times H s over s.

914
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Basically, you multiply G p with H, and then divide by s.

915
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Then you find the corresponding Z transform,

916
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
then multiply with that.

917
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
You get this pulse transfer function.

918
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,000
So B z will be equal to this pulse transfer function times E z.

919
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Okay?

920
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Yeah, we did this in week three.

921
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Okay?

922
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Okay, so based on that, you can find G z equals this.

923
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Yeah, you substitute this.

924
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Yeah, you consider this equation.

925
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,000
You move the term here to the left and factorize E z out.

926
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Then you find E z to be this.

927
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Right?

928
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
So you move this here.

929
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:14,000
You have coefficient 1 plus G H z as the coefficient of E z.

930
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
So E z equals that.

931
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Okay, so we are using this E z to find the steady state.

932
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Yeah, based on final value theorem.

933
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
So it's 1 minus Z inverse times E z when Z turns to 1.

934
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Okay?

935
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
So this analysis is possible for us to do.

936
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Okay, now let's consider a few typical case.

937
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
When the input is unit step,

938
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
yeah, when this is unit step,

939
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
then we do steady state analysis.

940
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
If this is unit step, R z will be equal to this.

941
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Then we substitute this R z to the formula we just obtained.

942
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Yeah, this is the formula we just obtained.

943
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Yeah, you have this R z.

944
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Then this one times this.

945
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
This cancel out.

946
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
So you just have this term.

947
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And this limit is equal to that.

948
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
So based on this, we can have a definition.

949
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Called position error constant, K P.

950
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
That is this term.

951
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Then the steady state error will be 1 over 1 plus K P.

952
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Okay, this K P, what depends on the type of the system?

953
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Yeah, just now I have a definition of the type of the system.

954
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Here.

955
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Yeah, this is the open loop transfer function, G H Z.

956
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Yeah, that's G H Z.

957
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:22,000
So if you have zero integrator, what do you have here?

958
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
When Z tends to 1, you get B1 divided by A1.

959
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Yeah, if this N is zero, you don't have this part.

960
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
So you just have B1 divided by A1.

961
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
So this K P is just a constant.

962
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Then you have a non-zero error in this case.

963
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Because 1 over 1 plus K P, K P is a constant.

964
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:55,000
So in this case, you cannot find the zero steady state error

965
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
to track this constant input.

966
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,000
However, if your open loop transfer function here has an integrator,

967
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
for example, N equals 1, what do you have?

968
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
When Z equals 1, that is when Z tends to 1,

969
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
this will go to infinity, right?

970
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Yeah, because 1 divided by 0, that's infinity.

971
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
If N is 1, what's bigger than 1?

972
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Then this is a constant.

973
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So this is infinity, K P can be infinity,

974
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
then this 1 divided by infinity will be zero.

975
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
So if you want to have zero steady state error,

976
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
your open loop transfer function should have at least one integrator.

977
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Okay, so that's the case when we consider unit step input.

978
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Now, if your input here is a ramp,

979
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
yeah, ramp, what's the,

980
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:09,000
yeah, if this R T here is the ramp,

981
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
in this case, your R Z will be equal to this.

982
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Yeah, you can find this Z transform from the table.

983
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
So, you use the formula we just have,

984
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
then you substitute this R Z to here,

985
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
and do some calculation.

986
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Actually, here, you have a square,

987
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
so any cancel out one factor,

988
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
so you have 1 minus Z inverse lift in the denominator here.

989
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
So this multiply the denominator here,

990
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
you have these two terms, okay?

991
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Then when Z go to one, this will go to zero,

992
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
that will go to one.

993
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
So you have this, yeah, this T in the numerator,

994
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,000
that go to zero, so you have this part,

995
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
and you divide T again, you get this.

996
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
So we have a definition of velocity error constant K V.

997
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
For this case,

998
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,000
you see this error will be one divided by K V, right?

999
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
This is the definition.

1000
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Actually, K V also depends on the number of integrators.

1001
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Yeah, if this N is zero, what is K V?

1002
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
If this N is zero, you don't have this.

1003
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Then when Z go to one, this term will go to constant.

1004
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
So that means this is a constant.

1005
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Then this will go to zero.

1006
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
So K V is zero, then that will be infinity.

1007
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
In this case, if you have no integrator,

1008
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
your speed is error will go to infinity

1009
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
if your input is ramped.

1010
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
However, if your system has one integrator,

1011
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
this will cancel out with this.

1012
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Yeah, one under the inverse will cancel out this,

1013
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
then you have a constant.

1014
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
So you have a non-zero state error,

1015
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
but not go to infinity.

1016
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Okay?

1017
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Similarly, you can analyze acceleration input.

1018
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
In this case, you have this R Z,

1019
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,000
then you do some calculation by substituting this R Z to here.

1020
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Yeah, you get this.

1021
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
You have cube, so you have square left in the denominator.

1022
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
After you take limit, you get this.

1023
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And you can put this square in the denominator.

1024
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And we have the definition of acceleration error constant, K A.

1025
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
So that's the definition.

1026
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Again, steady state error will be one over K A.

1027
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Okay, so these are the definitions of three error constants.

1028
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
And based on the error constants,

1029
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,000
we have those steady state error summarized in this table.

1030
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Just now, I already considered,

1031
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
if you have a step input and your system types zero,

1032
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
you have non-zero steady state error.

1033
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Because K P is a constant.

1034
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
And if your system type one, that means

1035
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
if you have one integrator, that will go to zero.

1036
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Two integrator, that will go to zero.

1037
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
For ramp input, yeah, this is the input to the system.

1038
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Type zero, that error will go to infinity.

1039
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I already analyzed that.

1040
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
For type one, that's a constant.

1041
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
For type two, that will be zero.

1042
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
And so on, you have this situation.

1043
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Okay, so that's the steady state error analysis.

1044
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Yeah, this analysis just applies to our system here.

1045
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Because our transfer function is obtained

1046
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
based on this system.

1047
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And also, actually, the error I mentioned

1048
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
is not steady state tracking error.

1049
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
It's a steady state actuating error here.

1050
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You see, it's the error between R T and B T.

1051
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
If H is one, then it's tracking error.

1052
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Okay?

1053
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
If you have other configurations,

1054
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
you can do similar analysis.

1055
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Yeah, you have some other configuration here.

1056
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Maybe as exercise, you can define

1057
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
the position error constant, velocity error constant,

1058
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
acceleration constant, or coordinate

1059
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
for each of the configuration in the system.

1060
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Okay, finally, we consider our response to disturbance.

1061
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Yeah, just now we considered input R T here.

1062
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
And we found the output.

1063
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Now, if we have disturbance, for example here,

1064
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
you have disturbance entering the system.

1065
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Then, how do we find the output?

1066
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,000
You can use superposition, because this is a linear system.

1067
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
So, in other words, the total output C Z

1068
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
will be equal to the output when R is zero

1069
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and N is non-zero, plus when N is zero, R is non-zero.

1070
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
So, you find the response of your output

1071
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
respectively to R and N.

1072
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Previously, we already considered response to R.

1073
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
So, now we focus on response to disturbance.

1074
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
So, we want to find the output in response to N.

1075
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,000
To do this, we find the transfer function from N to C.

1076
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Okay, we do a transformation of the block diagram.

1077
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I think you should know how to do block diagram transformation.

1078
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
So, that's N.

1079
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Then, after this, you have this G.

1080
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Yeah, that's G.

1081
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Yeah, this is a summation, but here is a subtraction.

1082
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
So, this sign is moved to here.

1083
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
So, N applied to this, you have G.

1084
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Then, that's output C.

1085
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
C is feedback through, yeah, GD.

1086
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So, here, C is feedback through GD.

1087
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
This negative sign is moved to here.

1088
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Okay?

1089
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
So, you have feedback pass.

1090
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Okay, based on this diagram,

1091
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
you can find the transfer function

1092
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:25,000
from N to output C.

1093
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And then, you find the error.

1094
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Actually, we also consider error analysis.

1095
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Okay?

1096
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Yeah.

1097
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
So, our R is zero in this case.

1098
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
What's the error for this situation?

1099
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
The error is actual 18 error.

1100
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
If we have unit feedback,

1101
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
yeah, actually, this diagram is unit feedback.

1102
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Then, the error is same as tracking error.

1103
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
So, it's R minus C.

1104
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Yeah, that's always the definition of error G.

1105
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And R is zero, so that's negative C, right?

1106
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Yeah, we assume R is zero,

1107
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
because we try to use superposition.

1108
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
So, this is the transfer function

1109
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
from N to C.

1110
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
It's G divided by one plus G times GD.

1111
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
But, in front, you have negative,

1112
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
and the input here is N.

1113
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
So, that's how you find this C.

1114
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
C is equal to this G divided by that times N.

1115
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Okay?

1116
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Okay.

1117
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
If the denominator here is much bigger than one,

1118
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
then you can, I mean, the magnitude,

1119
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
yeah, is much bigger than one,

1120
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
then you can ignore this one.

1121
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
If you ignore that,

1122
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
then this becomes this, approximately.

1123
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Okay?

1124
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
So, this G comes out with this G.

1125
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
You have negative one over GD N.

1126
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
So, based on this 4.11,

1127
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
if this GD has very large magnitude for all Z,

1128
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
the error is small.

1129
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
In fact, we want this error to be small.

1130
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
That means, if this is small,

1131
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
the effect of disturbance is small.

1132
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Okay?

1133
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Now, let's consider a special case.

1134
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
That is, if this N is a constant disturbance,

1135
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
yeah, just now we considered general case.

1136
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
If N is constant,

1137
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
and this GD includes a pure integrator,

1138
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
which means GD has a pole at Z equals one.

1139
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Yeah, this GD is designed by us.

1140
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
So, you can include an integrator in your GD.

1141
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And we also assume this GZ.

1142
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
That's the transfer function of the plant.

1143
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Yeah, GD is a controller.

1144
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
GZ is the transfer function of the plant.

1145
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
So, GZ has no zero at Z equals one.

1146
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
If we have zero, then this integrator pole

1147
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
will be cancelled out by this zero.

1148
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Then, under this saturation,

1149
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
this error due to a constant disturbance is zero.

1150
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Yeah, the K word here is steady state error.

1151
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
So, that means one time go to infinity.

1152
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Even if you have a non-zero value here,

1153
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:03,000
the error will be eliminated by the integrator.

1154
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Of course, during the transition period,

1155
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
you cannot eliminate.

1156
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Okay, now let's do a proof.

1157
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Assume this GD equals that.

1158
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Because GD has an integrator,

1159
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
so the denominator should have this factor.

1160
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
And the remaining part is just G hat D, Z.

1161
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Of course, this is non-polynomial.

1162
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
It's actually a transfer function.

1163
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Yeah, we just factorized Z minus one out.

1164
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
So, based on this, you can also do this manipulation.

1165
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
And this part has no zero at Z equals one.

1166
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Because if you have zero,

1167
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
then the integrator has no meaning.

1168
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It's cancelled out.

1169
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Now, we assume the constant disturbance is C.

1170
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
The value is C.

1171
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:03,000
So, the disturbance Z transform is C divided by this.

1172
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
This is the Z transform of a constant value.

1173
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Okay, now let's use 4.10 to do calculation.

1174
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
4.10 is here.

1175
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Now, of course, you have to substitute this GD into here.

1176
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:32,000
And the GZ, yeah, this GZ has no zero at Z equals one.

1177
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
NZ, NZ equals that.

1178
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
So, we substitute NZ and the GD to this 4.10.

1179
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
And also consider the final value theorem.

1180
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
You get this.

1181
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
This G is this G.

1182
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Yeah, that's your controller part.

1183
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
That's NZ.

1184
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Okay, so NZ equals that.

1185
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Just now, we get this NZ.

1186
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
And we have this just copied here.

1187
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Okay, so you do a calculation.

1188
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
You multiply one minus Z inverse.

1189
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Inside the denominator, you have these two terms.

1190
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Yeah, one times that, you get this.

1191
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
This one minus Z inverse comes out with this.

1192
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
So, you have GD hat Z, Z inverse times G.

1193
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Then one minus Z inverse combined with G and C, you get this.

1194
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Okay, you take a limit.

1195
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
This goes to zero because G has no zero at Z equals one.

1196
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
So, this will go to constant.

1197
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
C is a constant.

1198
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
So, a constant times zero is zero.

1199
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,000
This will go to zero, but this is non-zero.

1200
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
That's not equal to one.

1201
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
That's G one.

1202
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
G one is non-zero because you don't have zero at the...

1203
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Yeah, GZ has no zero at Z equals one.

1204
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
So, this is zero.

1205
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Okay?

1206
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:21,000
So, we proved our disturbance has no effect.

1207
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:27,000
And your arrow at the speed state.

1208
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
That means this disturbance effect is eliminated by a controller,

1209
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
including integrator.

1210
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
If your controller has integrator, so at the speed state,

1211
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
if this is a constant, it has no effect.

1212
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
But it has effect during transition period.

1213
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Okay, so that's the first part of my course.

1214
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:59,000
I will come back in week nine.

1215
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Yeah, but before that, we have a quiz today.

1216
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Okay.

1217
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Okay.

1218
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Okay.

1219
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Okay.

1220
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Okay.

1221
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Okay.

1222
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Okay.

1223
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Okay.

1224
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Okay.

1225
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Okay.

1226
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Okay.

1227
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Okay.

1228
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Okay.

1229
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Okay.

1230

Okay.

1232
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Okay.

1233
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Okay.

1234
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Okay.

1235
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Okay.

1236
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Okay.

1237
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Okay.

1238
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Okay.

1239
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Okay.

1240
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Okay.

1241
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Okay.

1242
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Okay.

1243
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Okay.

1244
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Okay.

1245
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Okay.

Okay.

1273

Okay.

1274
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Okay.

1275
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Okay.

1276
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Okay.

1277
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
