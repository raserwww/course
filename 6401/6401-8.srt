1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
And now, after the recess week, I'm back here again.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:18,920
Yeah, so I hope so far you have done well for part one, which

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,320
actually is very good news.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,080
Also, the assignment will be marked by pro-woon,

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,520
because that was his part.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,520
And I have a very quick check.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,560
At least this time, all the students

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,600
have submitted the assignment one, because I was

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,160
the coordinator for the past five years or so.

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,560
And this is probably the first time,

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,640
I mean, all the students in the class.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,320
I don't know, maybe some of you may submit just one page

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,360
or half page.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,680
But that's up to him to check.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,000
But at least everyone managed to submit, so that's good news.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,600
And at the same time, I also hope

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,000
everyone can come for the quiz for the part two,

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,560
because each in this course, we only have two CAs,

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,400
not like some other courses that have more than two, three,

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,040
or four.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,440
So each one has 20%.

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:43,400
Maybe I show this again, because for those students who

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,560
are not here, at least you watch the video recording.

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,840
This is also what I showed last time,

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,560
and in dealing with one I highlight.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,000
And it remains the same, pro-woon has finished part one,

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,600
which is deterministic SP.

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,240
And then now I resume the statistical SP.

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:24,160
But it's different from the other courses, 7.402.

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,880
I'm also teaching, actually.

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,440
Some students take both courses.

32
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:38,720
May I know how many of you take the 7.402 also?

33
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,480
OK, good.

34
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,400
So at least some, probably.

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
Let me see.

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,120
There may be about 20 to 30 students out of.

37
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,280
Because now these two class size are about the same, 160.

38
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,320
So the overlap, probably I estimate,

39
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,840
because in that course I'm teaching estimation.

40
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,440
So I do the estimation, just based on my experience.

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,080
I don't check the actual name list,

42
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,240
but it could be about 20 to 30 students.

43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,480
So one thing I want to highlight here

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,480
is for those students who take both courses, at least

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,040
you will find it easier in this part of things

46
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,120
is somewhat related.

47
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:41,480
It's true, some of the knowledge is the basics are very similar,

48
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:49,560
because in both part two of this course and the 7.402.

49
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,360
So they are all based on two very basic.

50
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,000
One is probability, and a little bit of random process,

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,440
but not very deep knowledge.

52
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,280
And at the same time, also need some linear algebra,

53
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,360
as you will see in this part two.

54
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,800
But in the same, I also find it easier for students

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,200
for the 7.402, because all the course is about statistical

56
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,240
signal processing.

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,800
So it takes some time to get the basic.

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,760
So I must say, based on past experience,

59
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:44,440
students taking this path will find it more difficult,

60
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,280
because your part one is, as you can see here,

61
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,760
deterministic signal processing.

62
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,760
So you don't hardly touch anything

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,720
which are random and so on.

64
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,240
But now, of course, those students

65
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,880
who have a good foundation, they already

66
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,360
learn probabilities and so on.

67
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,200
As I say, maybe among the 20 to 30 students who have already

68
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:18,640
taken my other course, you'll find it is somewhat easier.

69
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,240
But for other students, I really hope

70
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:30,960
you can put in more efforts, because we only

71
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,640
have six weeks here.

72
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:40,920
So today, I will try to finish chapter one,

73
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
because I won't go through it again,

74
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,280
but since there are about six weeks, seven weeks,

75
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,280
including the recess in between.

76
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,280
So some of the very important ones may be forgotten.

77
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,640
And also, some students say they did not take the week one,

78
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,080
because it's during the airdrop.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,760
That's understandable, because we are Monday class.

80
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,880
Some students even did not arrive in time

81
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,160
during week one Monday.

82
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,040
So today, I will balance about not going, of course,

83
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:28,480
not going through the very basic again, but I will compromise.

84
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,600
So my plan is let's finish this first.

85
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:42,280
So again, coming to here, you're familiar with this setting

86
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,520
now, hopefully.

87
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,560
60% for the final exam, we have four questions.

88
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,560
We just finished setting the exam question by this time.

89
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,000
CA, as I just mentioned, we already done that,

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,920
so that's very good.

91
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,800
But I think it will take a few weeks for program to mark.

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,480
And then I also already put, because our class size is not

93
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,080
that large.

94
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,480
So this LTE is just good enough for the whole class.

95
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:20,080
About during quiz, we will have, you

96
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,720
don't seek one next to the other.

97
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,400
You always have one seat in between.

98
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,480
And this size is just good enough.

99
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,720
I have some student TA.

100
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,600
So please note out this time is week 12 is just here.

101
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:44,720
And then I also say the time is 8 to 9 PM, which is one hour.

102
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,240
Close book, just like exam similar to the final exam,

103
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,440
20%.

104
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,800
So you already done the assignment one,

105
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,800
so this is the next milestone.

106
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,520
So anyway, I already now, so you learn,

107
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,320
can do that later also.

108
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,960
So now coming back to this, this is my contact.

109
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,880
I think you can easily find from the lecture notes.

110
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,560
So in a sense, the content looks crazy.

111
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,760
We have very little to learn, because other than the 7402,

112
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,120
almost every week we have one chapter,

113
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,280
so two different topic to cover.

114
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:46,440
Program's part also have quite a few topic almost every week

115
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,760
as one.

116
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,240
So here, we only have three things.

117
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,600
And chapter one is introduction, which

118
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,280
is more in some background.

119
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,000
But in Excel, we already have some technical content,

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,080
as you know, dealing with one for those of you who came here.

121
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,600
And out of that, we have linear prediction and optimal linear

122
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,440
filter.

123
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,000
But this filter is quite different from program's part.

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,240
Also, there is some relationship,

125
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,120
and actually, it's quite important.

126
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,360
If you did well in part one, you'll

127
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,080
find it easier, because I won't start again

128
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,400
by introducing filters, the property, and so on.

129
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,200
And then finally, there is a power spectrum estimation,

130
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,600
which in a sense is more difficult,

131
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,320
because it requires the chapter two, the linear prediction,

132
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:52,040
and then add on some metrics, theory, and so on.

133
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,280
So roughly, I have six weeks, but usually the last week,

134
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:06,440
I will use maybe about half of the week to cover the content.

135
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,480
If I can finish all, then I will make the whole week free.

136
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,920
But at least half of the week.

137
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,640
And then half a week, you know, eight to nine,

138
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,280
because after nine, I mean, we will collect quiz papers.

139
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:27,600
So during week 12, yeah, there's only half, one hour plus left.

140
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,520
So in total, about five weeks for my part.

141
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,400
So my plan is based on past experience.

142
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,840
I will finish chapter one today, one week.

143
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,840
And then chapter two, it takes at most two weeks,

144
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,440
because it's a little bit shorter than chapter three.

145
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,360
And anyway, because these two chapters,

146
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,080
it will be the content for the quiz, because by, yeah.

147
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,200
So the plan by week, now is week eight, nine, 10.

148
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,160
So after week 10, you can do the revisions for whatever

149
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,640
preparing for the quiz.

150
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:15,120
So the last chapter will not be the content for the quiz,

151
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,560
but it could be, of course, it will be the exams, you know,

152
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,920
content for some of you who may already

153
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,880
take a look at some past year exam paper.

154
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
So it should be about half, half.

155
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,360
Usually it's, yeah, OK.

156
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,680
So that's the background and some introduction

157
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,040
to prepare you.

158
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,280
Any questions?

159
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:53,480
Yeah, I think this is kind of introduction to my part also.

160
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,280
Yeah, anything you want to ask, feel free.

161
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:04,280
You can raise your hands or just, yeah.

162
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,320
So let's go back quickly again to this.

163
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,000
You know, this one is show some relationship,

164
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,600
because at week one, I say for those student,

165
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,440
if you are lacking background in signaling system DSP,

166
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,920
you will find it difficult. But I,

167
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,920
and that's why some student, you know, like drop out,

168
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,360
because they find it difficult to self-study these two.

169
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,800
But now, for those staying on at least,

170
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,480
you should already have a good kind of standing.

171
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,360
Otherwise, you will have difficulty

172
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,680
to move on to this ADSP.

173
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,120
So now you're finished these two, assuming at least you

174
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,520
learn those requirements.

175
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,880
So now you are partially in this path.

176
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,720
So as I say, it's somewhat related to probability

177
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,800
of random processing, the statistical signal processing.

178
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,080
A little bigger, not that much a linear system.

179
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:17,080
There's more control related, but some of the metrics,

180
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,560
you know, they are all, yeah, related.

181
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:31,120
So any questions before we go into the main context?

182
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,440
And I want to test your memory for those of you

183
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,240
who attend the week one lecture.

184
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,720
I did not finish the whole chapter one,

185
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:52,400
so can you roughly tell me where did I stop?

186
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,280
Did you read the lecture note?

187
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,960
At what point?

188
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,400
Any memory?

189
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,800
Where do I stop?

190
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,320
Here or early?

191
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,080
Did I talk about power density spectrum?

192
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,580
No?

193
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,920
So OK.

194
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,200
Anyone want to give a guess?

195
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,800
Do you remember?

196
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Zhengyi?

197
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,280
Not to mention the 1.4 power density spectrum.

198
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,280
I just want to stop at the 1.0.

199
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,800
OK.

200
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,560
OK, that's true.

201
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,200
Yeah.

202
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,920
Yeah, that's very good because I did not

203
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,480
go into the innovation representation.

204
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,000
I finished the power density spectrum.

205
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,880
They're probably a little bit rushing.

206
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,080
Just talk a little bit.

207
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,320
Is it right?

208
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,840
I did mention some power spectrum.

209
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,160
Is it right or not?

210
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,080
Not talking power spectrum density at all?

211
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,600
Oh, OK.

212
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,200
OK, good, good.

213
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,120
Thanks.

214
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,840
So I cover that part briefly.

215
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,480
OK.

216
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:31,320
So anyway, let's start this lecture, chapter 1, again.

217
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,800
Yes.

218
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,280
Hold this.

219
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,800
Let me see.

220
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,280
Full screen mode.

221
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,160
OK, so that's what we are supposed to do.

222
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,800
Yeah.

223
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:56,320
And then the textbook, as I say, it

224
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,480
has the two versions, both called fourth edition.

225
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,120
But this earlier one is the one we'll be using in the library

226
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,600
as the reserve room when you go enter.

227
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,760
There were several books on that, so you can take a book.

228
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,360
Because the reason is this newer version,

229
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't know why, also called fourth edition.

230
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,280
Yeah, they both called fourth edition.

231
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
But this is several years later.

232
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,760
They removed the power spectrum estimation chapter.

233
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:42,680
But I think that part is quite important and useful.

234
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,640
But in case you check some past year exam paper,

235
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,160
you'll notice some of the early paper

236
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,520
we have adaptive filter.

237
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,920
But now we do not have that part in this course

238
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,800
after revision of the curriculum.

239
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:12,080
So it's focused more on linear filter and linear prediction

240
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:19,560
filter and the power density spectrum estimation.

241
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:26,600
So yeah, I think by now you already

242
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,120
know very well for this.

243
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,120
And also in terms of system, there are many.

244
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,320
But what we are doing is just deterministic.

245
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,880
System is deterministic.

246
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,920
Don't get confused with system and signals.

247
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,600
The signals are mostly the random part.

248
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,400
The system will be deterministic.

249
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,560
And then we also go mostly on the discrete time and linear.

250
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:11,400
And also, because things we don't talk adaptive filter,

251
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,080
it will be time invariant.

252
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:25,960
So for systems, again here, your deterministic signals,

253
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,440
which is your cover already learned in part one

254
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,920
or before that, DSP and those content, multirate,

255
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,600
they all belong to this.

256
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,760
We don't talk about chaos here.

257
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,680
And then now our signal are mostly dealing

258
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,360
with stochastic and random.

259
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,040
Of course, when we talk about random signals,

260
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,480
it could be part of the signal.

261
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
It could be also deterministic.

262
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,320
It can be a sum of both.

263
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,720
But usually, we refer to the more difficult signals,

264
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,760
like random signal.

265
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,560
As you all know, it's more difficult

266
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,320
comparing the deterministic.

267
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,280
So that will be the one we'll be going.

268
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,760
And then we only consider stationary process, then

269
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:27,880
the gothic process, which we do not really go through in detail.

270
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,560
So you can see, in terms of signal, it will be this part.

271
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,880
So now come to random signals.

272
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:55,200
I, so still, it's good to at least,

273
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,840
of course, for those who do not have much background.

274
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:08,440
So you will need to build in these random signal concepts.

275
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:14,720
So random signal, for example, if I have a coin here, I free.

276
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,360
So you all know a coin has two sides, face or tail.

277
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:30,080
So before it falls down, no one knows it will be face or tail.

278
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,800
So that's the very fundamental concept about being random.

279
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,560
So you'll need to keep this in mind.

280
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:48,320
Random signal is not like side way or square way where

281
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,240
you have the waveform.

282
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,440
You know exactly what the next value or even future value.

283
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,040
So this is something you'll need to keep this in mind.

284
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:09,000
But at the same time, it's not that we totally cannot deal

285
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,640
with random signal.

286
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,680
Then you may say, since there's random, so what can we do?

287
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,120
You just ignore it, just guess.

288
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,160
Every time is guess.

289
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,960
So no point to study.

290
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,800
Is it right?

291
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,920
No, not really the case.

292
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:35,560
Because among the random signal, for example, the output,

293
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,840
you cannot predict.

294
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:44,360
But there is this statistic behind this random signal

295
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,680
underneath.

296
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:53,720
So typically, we try to get some information out

297
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,320
of random signal.

298
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,200
For example, different random signal,

299
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,280
they behave differently.

300
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,800
Say, for example, if I have these ties, you see,

301
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,720
that's the, I don't know whether you can see, six-phase.

302
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,040
So if I throw these ties, so different from that one.

303
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,160
I mean, they are similarity and difference.

304
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:30,320
The similar one is we cannot tell which number it will turn

305
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,360
out because it will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

306
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,200
So in this thing, it's also random.

307
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,520
You cannot predict until the outcome is out.

308
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:50,200
But there's also difference because the other one,

309
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,320
the output value, you only have either phase or tail.

310
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,880
So we say it either can put it as either 0 or 1.

311
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,000
Well, here it's 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

312
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,080
So the probability, you try to describe this random process,

313
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,120
it will be different from each other.

314
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,640
And then that's why for random process,

315
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,640
we still try to get the most out of it.

316
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,400
If not like a side way, you can predict.

317
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,120
Because this is, as we already know,

318
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,880
you cannot predict until the value come up.

319
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,640
But we are able to study some of the statistics.

320
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,880
Typically, it's the average, which is very common.

321
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,600
That's why I have a student in the 7402.

322
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,960
I always highlight the two most important thing

323
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:02,600
about random signal or random variable, mean and value.

324
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,880
So mean is you take the first of the statistic.

325
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,600
Because being random, we try to average

326
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,400
to see whether, on average, what we can get.

327
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,840
And this average is very important

328
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,680
considering every day's life.

329
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,840
For example, in this class, at the end,

330
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,720
we will take the average amount of all the students.

331
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,320
And this is very important, because we

332
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,960
need to roughly moderate so that each

333
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,560
course, the average is about the same or not exact.

334
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
So that's a very important committee.

335
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,880
And the same as you see, every student,

336
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,080
you'll apply to come in.

337
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,720
I think I assume all of you pass this average CGPA.

338
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,960
CGPA is also average.

339
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,080
Because you may be very good in one some course,

340
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,960
but not so good in other.

341
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,800
So we need to take the average to see overall how good you are.

342
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,640
So this average is the most important.

343
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,320
And that's a first of the statistic

344
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,280
for random variable.

345
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,760
And the second one is the variant.

346
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,920
And also very similar, the moment,

347
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,240
the second of the moment, which measure the correlation.

348
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,160
Being random, I mean, the value of a variable

349
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,760
except it will be how much variation.

350
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,040
Because being random, it must be something keep changing.

351
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,280
So how much change?

352
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,200
Is it very near the average?

353
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,400
It change very little.

354
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
So that's why I say the value is very small.

355
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,440
So if a value is very small, then it's

356
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,920
very close to a deterministic signal.

357
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,720
So in the limited case, the value becomes zero.

358
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,000
It will be no longer random.

359
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,680
Am I right?

360
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,880
There will be no change.

361
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,920
And if the value is infinitely large,

362
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:20,640
so that's why noise, there is too much change.

363
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:28,160
You don't have much property out of that.

364
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,040
So that's how to study random signal, random variable.

365
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,840
You get this very basic idea.

366
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,480
And then after that, mathematically,

367
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,160
how are we going to describe?

368
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:50,880
As I always say, the best to describe random variable

369
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,000
is for continuous random variable

370
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,720
will be PDF for discrete random variable will be PMF.

371
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,720
So because that give you the best description,

372
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,160
it include all the order of the statistic.

373
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,720
But if you don't have that, it's not the end of the world.

374
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,120
You can still get, based on the data,

375
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:27,000
you can get first order, second order, the statistic

376
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,240
to describe.

377
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,720
So I think these are the very, very, very basic concepts.

378
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,680
And then how to define discrete random variable from what

379
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:51,000
I just mentioned early.

380
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,520
You need to have the sample space,

381
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,600
and then define an event, how likely it's going to happen,

382
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,240
and so on.

383
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,760
Yes.

384
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:10,560
So this is the two fair dice.

385
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:19,720
The one is another good example about this random variable,

386
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,680
and also the statistic.

387
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,520
Because if you just look at the throw one dice,

388
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,240
you'll have six values.

389
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,680
So you'll know unless you purposely

390
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,800
make a very special dice, but a fair one, you will.

391
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,600
So each outcome is one out of six.

392
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,880
So you'll know.

393
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,320
So there's no problem.

394
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,480
But then the event will be different.

395
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:59,080
For example, if we throw two dice at the same time,

396
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:07,160
and the number of each dice, you will have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

397
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,680
And the other one also 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

398
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,520
But then now I define the event of sum

399
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,720
the outcome of these two number.

400
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:28,600
Then it's no longer equal probability.

401
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,040
Because if you look at the sums, in total,

402
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:41,640
the combination will be 36, because you have 1 to 6.

403
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,920
And then the other dice, it goes from 1 to 6.

404
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,960
So you'll know the combination.

405
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,560
It will be just 6 multiplied by 36.

406
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,880
And in this case, you can see being random variable,

407
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,720
how you get the events out of, say, one random variable

408
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,200
or two random variables, you already

409
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:21,000
see the different values for this event.

410
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,000
For example, in this case, all these 36 combinations

411
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,320
is very easy to check the sum of the two value being

412
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,880
in the center.

413
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,600
2 is only 1.

414
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,120
Sum these two number 1 plus 1.

415
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,720
There's only one probability, where 6 and plus 6 also 1.

416
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,680
But then there are quite a number of possibility

417
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:56,620
when you sum two number equal to 6 or equal to 7.

418
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,980
So that's how this probability.

419
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,180
Also, in saying it's random, but there are still

420
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:15,280
some statistics of probabilities and of properties behind it.

421
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:27,520
So you need to base on the given either PDF or the statistic

422
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:34,360
to describe the events out of this randomness.

423
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,480
So that's something you'll need to keep this in mind.

424
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:46,640
And then, as I say, PMF is the one for this great random

425
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,720
variable.

426
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,040
And continual random variable is easier to understand,

427
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:58,280
because we all know, I believe, even so,

428
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,760
we have a little knowledge about probability.

429
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,880
Everyone must have heard of Gaussian distribution.

430
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,520
And that's a very typical case for continued random variable.

431
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,160
And like bell curve and all this noise,

432
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,120
they all follow the Gaussian period.

433
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,080
That's how this is done here.

434
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,720
Normal or Gaussian distribution.

435
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:35,880
So I always say you may not need to memorize all the PDF.

436
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:43,680
But Gaussian PDF is like you can check with your seniors

437
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,480
last year or the year or the year before.

438
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,600
I always, for quiz, always pass Gaussian.

439
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,360
So you should be familiar.

440
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,680
And therefore, Gaussian PDF, I will not give you the formula.

441
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,360
Actually, some students, whether in this course,

442
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,760
we give some other course.

443
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,840
They give one page.

444
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,840
You can, in the exam, you can bring one A4 site page.

445
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,600
You write whatever small part.

446
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,920
But knowing this course, so everything

447
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,240
will require you to memorize the basic one.

448
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,000
Not the very complicated formula.

449
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,000
But Gaussian random variable and uniform distribution,

450
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,080
these two are the simple and the required one.

451
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:39,240
So I make good use of this opportunity to highlight here.

452
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,360
Because Gaussian random variable,

453
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,520
you only need to know two parameters,

454
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,280
the mean and the value.

455
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,800
So you go back to what I just highlighted earlier,

456
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,800
means and value are the most important ones.

457
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,160
Because for example, for Gaussian, knowing these two,

458
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,240
you know completely the PDF.

459
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,600
But of course, some other random variable,

460
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,200
you may not have this relationship.

461
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,920
And then expectation is actually this

462
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,080
is mean, we take the mean, expectation

463
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:27,240
is a more formal definition.

464
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:34,280
And so I always say if you look at expectation,

465
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,920
you can, by looking at the formula,

466
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:44,800
you can try to figure out the meaning of it

467
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:54,400
The PDF here is more like the weighting function.

468
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,280
Say for example, if you do not add this PDF,

469
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,800
you are just summed for this random variable.

470
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800
You are just summing up the value

471
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,720
of this random variable.

472
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,880
So something like you are taking the average.

473
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,560
But if you multiply p of x, that means

474
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,040
if the p of x for this particular x value

475
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,240
give you a much bigger value, larger compared to other.

476
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,600
So you'll give it more weightage.

477
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,160
That means this x with a larger value of p of x

478
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,200
is more important when you're doing the sum.

479
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:50,200
And that also highlights the importance of having this,

480
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:56,160
knowing the PDF for this random variable,

481
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,640
we call that as a PMF.

482
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,840
For continue, it will be PDF.

483
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,160
And also the difference of these two is for this grade,

484
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,280
you cannot integrate.

485
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,640
So that's a very, very basic.

486
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,320
So you need to do the summation with the things

487
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,400
where they are described values, just like what

488
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,960
you learn from DSP.

489
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,080
And for continue time, you cannot sum because there are

490
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,600
not infinity of them.

491
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,200
They are not countable.

492
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,480
So you need to do integration.

493
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,200
But other than that, the formula looks very similar.

494
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,200
So that's a very, very basic definition

495
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,320
of expectation or mean value.

496
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,040
And I think you can skip this moment.

497
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,280
So actually, you do not need that.

498
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,480
And the value is what here.

499
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,280
And how do we link these two?

500
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,640
Actually, if you can, yeah.

501
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,160
So once you know the basic definition,

502
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,880
what you need to do is you need to apply

503
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,960
what you learn in other math, calculus, and so on.

504
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,560
They are relatively simple.

505
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,800
You just expand the quadratic functions.

506
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,800
And you do not actually need to do integration

507
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,400
because based on the definition, you will get the results here.

508
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:41,960
And this table give you the very, yeah,

509
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,240
those are commonly used one.

510
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,160
And I think there is a part where there is a, OK.

511
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,880
So these are also very important.

512
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:58,240
If you have start with a random variable, as I earlier say, x.

513
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,720
So you already know how to get the expected value

514
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,760
of the random variable here.

515
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,720
But you can, from a random variable,

516
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,600
if you have an analytic or real value functions,

517
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,280
we call g of x.

518
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,680
Could be a side way, could be exponential function.

519
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,720
These are proper, just normal functions.

520
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,200
Not necessarily random, except.

521
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,280
But a random variable, you go through this real value

522
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,040
analytic function, g of x.

523
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,920
They become a new random variable, OK.

524
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,440
So yeah.

525
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:52,280
So the simple example is if x, you raise a power of 2,

526
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,920
become x power of 2.

527
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,640
So x power of 2 is a new random variable related to x.

528
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,880
So in this case, it is very important

529
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,360
to know the expectation, e of this, g of x,

530
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,040
the new random variable.

531
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:17,320
When you work out, you still use the same PDF to do the weighting.

532
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:23,840
Also, this function value changes, OK, from x to g of x.

533
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:31,400
So yeah, this result is already well known.

534
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,760
You don't need to try to get the new PDF of this new,

535
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,080
say, the new random variable y.

536
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:47,680
If this g of x, the y, is from the initial random variable x,

537
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,160
and you already know the PDF of this p of x.

538
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,720
So what I mean is just change the x value into g of x.

539
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,320
But this weighting function, the PDF,

540
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,920
you still use the same p of x.

541
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,280
And making this as a function, it

542
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:18,200
covers other, for example, higher order moments.

543
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,080
Like the fourth order moment, x to the power of 1,

544
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,360
which is the mean.

545
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:31,920
And x power of 2, we call it, yeah, this is 1 here.

546
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,000
If x raised to the power of 2 is the second order moment,

547
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,760
and so on, it can be higher.

548
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,000
And in these things, you can also

549
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,560
see the very important function here.

550
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,200
This variant is also coming from the x.

551
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,680
You can see this is a new function coming from x.

552
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,800
It's the x removed minus the mean.

553
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,480
And out of that, you raise power of 2.

554
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,680
So it's related to the second order moment.

555
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,960
But the difference is, second order moment,

556
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,920
you do not remove the mean.

557
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,200
You keep that x just like x minus 0.

558
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,840
Of course, the two are the same if the mean expectation

559
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,440
of this x equal to 0.

560
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,400
But they will be different if, say,

561
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,200
if this is a value different from 0.

562
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,360
So yeah, that's how you have this relationship

563
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,480
of the value of x.

564
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,920
And this expectation, this is x raised power of 2.

565
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,520
And this is e of x, the mean raised power of 2.

566
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,280
So don't get confused with this tool

567
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,440
also, because quite often, some student

568
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,840
in the middle of the elevation, they compute these two.

569
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,200
So one is you take expectation first and raise power of 2.

570
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,640
The other is you raise this random variable

571
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,080
into power of 2 and then take the expectation.

572
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:32,000
And there are three related to this formula.

573
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,680
Any question so far?

574
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:50,320
Because I tried to balance between the weak one,

575
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,000
because some of you came here.

576
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,720
So if I repeat everything, it's not fair.

577
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:01,560
But for some student who did not attain weak one before,

578
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,640
if I assume that you already learned then,

579
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,080
it may not be fair.

580
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:17,920
So today, I will try to highlight the important one.

581
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,640
But I would like to get some feedback from you

582
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:33,320
to see whether this is the right approach or how do you feel?

583
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,400
Do you still remember what we want?

584
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
It's too long time ago.

585
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,800
OK, so let's see what we can do here.

586
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,800
Now, we move on to the joy distribution,

587
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,560
this great random variable.

588
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,600
So this becomes a little bit more challenging,

589
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,640
because now you're considering two random variables

590
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,160
and try to find out their relationship.

591
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:22,160
And in general, you see, if you're

592
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,880
similar to the single random variable,

593
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,200
the best is if you're able to, for this guitar,

594
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,280
you're able to describe the joy probability mass function,

595
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,400
which give you a full description

596
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,160
of the relationship between these two random variables.

597
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:52,160
They could be independent, or they have some relationship.

598
00:44:52,160 --> 00:45:01,880
So you will be trying to see what the two events that are

599
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,440
going to happen.

600
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:14,920
Maybe one example is, as I say, some student

601
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,680
taking this course, and the same student,

602
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,520
they also take 7402.

603
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,680
So these two course, they have some co-relationship.

604
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:33,320
So you may think of how, if you are studying that or maybe

605
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,520
going to the final exam test, I do

606
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,560
find there is some co-relation.

607
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:47,760
Well, now then, you go to some courses

608
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,840
which are almost not related.

609
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:58,400
For example, actually, there is a side story here.

610
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,400
I think this course is probably not half, but at least quite

611
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:15,200
the number of students from either SP or SPML.

612
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:22,720
We currently have a course on Advanced Analog Circuit,

613
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,680
which is GE.

614
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,960
But this semester, the course was

615
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,720
offered in this semester.

616
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,640
None of the students from SP or SPML choose this course.

617
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,760
So based on this, you can see there

618
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:47,360
is almost not much relation with our SP or SPML program.

619
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:51,480
And that's why we are proposing to remove

620
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,440
this course out of the SPML.

621
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,080
But for the other four programs, I also

622
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:06,160
checked CCA, or there are always some students, maybe 10

623
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,880
or sometimes 20, taking that course, but zero students.

624
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,440
Very interesting.

625
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:17,360
So you see the correlation also from here.

626
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:23,440
Yeah, you can find out among the courses,

627
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,480
whether from the contents, and then you

628
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,000
can somehow figure out.

629
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,200
So as I said, coming back here, if you are able,

630
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,720
if you are given the choice probability mass function

631
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:46,240
for discrete random variables, then you

632
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,640
can describe the probability and the relationship

633
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,440
among these two random variables,

634
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,800
how they are distributed, and so on.

635
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:05,480
And similarly, for the continued random variable,

636
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,120
then you will do it by integration,

637
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:17,000
but assuming, of course, you have this joy PDF.

638
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,520
So later on, when we come to the random process,

639
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,760
we do need to apply this concept.

640
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,480
But going into the joy PDF will be not so easy,

641
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,960
because from here, you can also define the independence.

642
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,280
It will be based on that.

643
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:49,040
If these two random variables, they are independent,

644
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:56,560
then their joy probability will be separate.

645
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,920
So that means you are doing the simple multiplication.

646
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,360
And similarly, if you apply the PDF,

647
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,680
you will become just a product.

648
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,760
But in general, if there is some correlation,

649
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,760
then you will not have that property.

650
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,320
And very often, if you don't have the PDF or the joy PDF

651
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:26,360
to describe, so what you can do is

652
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,440
lower the requirement.

653
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,200
We are just trying to find out the correlation,

654
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,720
because correlation is easier to measure.

655
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,600
You are only based on the second statistic.

656
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,960
You may not even know the PDF.

657
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:54,440
And that's how you can define this correlation.

658
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,880
And then also, you can get the covariance.

659
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,920
So again, this concept is extending the one variable one.

660
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,960
You have one variable, you call it variant.

661
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,520
And here, we call it covariance, because we are dealing

662
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,640
with two random variables.

663
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:23,160
And the formula is somewhat similar.

664
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,600
It will be just here.

665
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,360
I don't know why it is.

666
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,680
Oh, sorry.

667
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:43,240
Sorry, it's not doing it.

668
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:49,640
Let's see.

669
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,640
Let's check.

670
00:50:51,640 --> 00:51:13,640
Yeah, the same, because...

671
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,200
Okay, yeah, I think early on,

672
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,680
it should be up here.

673
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:29,440
So yeah, so that's how we have this relationship

674
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:35,680
between independent and also correlations.

675
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,440
So there are, yeah.

676
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:44,960
And of course, the two of them are independent.

677
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:51,280
Independent is a higher requirement.

678
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,400
And independent will mean the covariance,

679
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,640
there will be not correlated, but not vice versa,

680
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,440
because uncorrelated is only based

681
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:09,240
on the second-order statistic, where the two random variables

682
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:15,120
are being independent, based on the period.

683
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:21,000
Yeah, so I think this is the XIGs.

684
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:29,240
I remember I did last time, but you can try it out

685
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,240
as a good XIGs.

686
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:38,120
And moving on is the more difficult concept

687
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:43,960
is the stochastic or random process.

688
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,280
So assuming you have some knowledge now

689
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,440
about random variables.

690
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:56,000
So the random process is, you can

691
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,240
consider there is a time variant random variable.

692
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:07,720
So you introduce another index of the time.

693
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,960
It's not necessarily our continued time.

694
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:17,120
It can be just the, it could be a sequence,

695
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:21,680
or it could be not necessarily the continued time

696
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,840
or discrete time.

697
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,960
It's just another index.

698
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,920
And I always like to compare this

699
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,560
with what you're learning from, I think all of you

700
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,800
should be familiar, image and video, you see.

701
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:43,080
So you can think about a video signal, which

702
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:48,240
is a moving image, you see.

703
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,840
Each time, if you freeze the time,

704
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,720
you are taking one frame of the video signal

705
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,880
and which becomes one image.

706
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,560
And anyway, I'll go on to the next moment.

707
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,120
Take another image.

708
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:08,000
And similarly here is a random process

709
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,960
is the one the random variable keep changing over time.

710
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:20,680
And that's how you, if you look at these pictures,

711
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:26,080
you will see it will be as a function of time.

712
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,920
It could be continued, could be discrete,

713
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,560
could be other index, just days and so on.

714
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:40,360
So the idea here is if you, for example, you

715
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:47,960
fix one time, say call it T1, then the random process

716
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:53,840
becomes just a random variable.

717
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,520
The outcome, it all depends on something

718
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:03,560
like you flip a coin or you throw a dice and so on.

719
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,920
We cannot predetermine it, but we

720
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:18,400
should have some PDF or some other statistic to describe it.

721
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:24,360
On the other hand, because being random,

722
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:30,640
you see, it generates many of these realizations.

723
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:41,200
So for each of the realizations, you will be just,

724
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,200
it will become a function over time.

725
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,960
It will be no longer random.

726
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,480
You take one realization.

727
00:55:51,480 --> 00:56:00,440
Just like, for example, again, you throw the coin, you see.

728
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:05,440
So you throw it once, you already know one outcome.

729
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,560
Your coin, say, fades, and then you continue throwing.

730
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,080
You throw it first time, second time, and so on.

731
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,560
So you keep writing down.

732
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:20,360
It could be tail, face, then face, face, tail, tail, again.

733
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,480
So that will become one realization.

734
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,640
It will be a function of the time.

735
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:35,120
So that's why we describe it as this.

736
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:46,080
So P here is not random, where S is a random variable.

737
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:51,680
And more importantly, if you fix T,

738
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,120
you will become a random variable, just one.

739
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:01,680
On the other hand, if you fix, if you take one realization out

740
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:06,840
of this random variable, and let the time keep changing,

741
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,680
it will be a normal function of the time,

742
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:15,080
like become probably unlikely to be a sideways, but yeah.

743
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,720
Sometimes it could be like a sideways.

744
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,480
If you have a sideways with a random face,

745
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:25,640
then it will become a sideways.

746
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,280
So you need to know this, extending the concept

747
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:35,240
of random variable to be a sequence.

748
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:42,440
And that's why this wide noise sequence is also very important.

749
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:50,320
You can view the wide noise as a sequence of random variable.

750
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:57,680
And each index itself is a random variable.

751
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,360
And this random variable, according to the index,

752
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,360
it also keeps changing.

753
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:15,320
And that's why we have this IID, identical and independent

754
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:20,000
distribution IID, which is very important.

755
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:28,600
So again, here, we are taking it one, say,

756
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,560
continuous random process.

757
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:36,840
So what we do is, as I already mentioned,

758
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:41,760
if you take one particular time sample,

759
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,840
it will become a random variable.

760
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:49,600
Then you can also consider the, say, for example,

761
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:55,680
the N's moment at that particular time incident.

762
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,360
So what you'll do is almost the same as before,

763
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:03,800
except you need to take out this.

764
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:08,840
So then you can also take the statistical or example

765
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:17,840
means and mean squared and statistical or example

766
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,040
barrier and so on.

767
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:25,160
So the definition will be similar.

768
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:32,200
But the difference here is at two different times,

769
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,720
you'll need to understand these two random variables.

770
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:46,480
So you can define, for example, correlations and so on,

771
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,400
based on that.

772
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:53,280
But because they are generated from the same random process,

773
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,760
and we call this auto correlation.

774
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,000
That's different from the cross correlation,

775
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,400
because you can get two different random process.

776
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,120
Then you'll do the correlation at different time.

777
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:16,000
So that's how the definitions and so on.

778
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,200
And all these are similar.

779
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,800
And cross correlation is because they

780
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,880
come from two different process and also

781
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,920
measure at different time.

782
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,200
So that's cross.

783
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,960
So it become a little bit more complicated.

784
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,440
If you're dealing with random process,

785
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,280
there will be more combinations and so on.

786
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:46,240
And the definition here are similar.

787
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,560
So you can, yeah.

788
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:52,040
And this stationary stochastic process

789
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:56,760
it become very difficult if you are looking at the choice

790
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:03,200
period, because there will be many combination

791
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,600
and usually very difficult to calculate.

792
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:13,800
So what we do, we are not really looking into that.

793
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:20,240
We are looking at those based on the second order

794
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:28,080
statistic, which is some kind of a weaker requirement, which

795
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:37,920
is just based on the auto correlation and the covariant.

796
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,040
You'll be just looking at, for example,

797
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:45,040
we start with auto correlation.

798
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:54,000
Then we can define the second order correlation at t1.

799
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,840
And now we are looking at the time sample.

800
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:03,320
So at this t1, you add some time interval called tau

801
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:08,520
to the next moment, we call it t1 plus tau.

802
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:17,800
So therefore, if it turns out to be the correlation only

803
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:23,080
depends on how much this difference of this interval,

804
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:27,640
say, for example, from 1 to 2, then the time difference

805
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,440
is 1.

806
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:34,440
And then if the correlation you try to measure from 2 to 3,

807
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,120
if the difference also 1, then it

808
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:43,880
turns out to be all this, as long as the difference

809
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:49,280
in this interval is the same, you will get the same result.

810
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,640
So this is a very important process

811
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,960
we call this stationary.

812
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:06,440
And that's the other than this second order statistical way

813
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:15,480
also require the mean of this, the white sense

814
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:23,280
or weakly stationary, which we don't need the joy PDF.

815
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:27,120
The mean value of this variable, t value,

816
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:30,840
it gives you the constant value.

817
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,560
That means it doesn't matter whether it's

818
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,520
1 second or 10 seconds or so.

819
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,920
It will become constant.

820
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,160
But you take note, this random variable

821
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,040
you say is not a constant.

822
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,440
It's the expectation of this.

823
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,720
So don't get confused.

824
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,040
And similarly, you have the variance

825
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:58,520
of this at one particular t1.

826
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:03,840
Your measure is also being constant.

827
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,720
And this autocorrelation, it will be what I say,

828
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:11,840
it only depends on the interval.

829
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:16,640
And you can see these three conditions

830
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:21,440
not fully independent of each other.

831
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:27,760
In fact, you get from two, you may

832
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:33,360
be able to define the third one.

833
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:37,080
So these are some of the exercises.

834
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:42,800
To get a better understanding of random process,

835
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,520
we have some example.

836
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,880
For example, you look at this random process.

837
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,840
So be careful.

838
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:58,240
If you look at the random process defined by a formula,

839
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:03,720
you have to be careful to look at each of the parameters

840
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,800
or the variable, the meaning of each of them.

841
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:10,080
Typically, t will always use that.

842
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,800
Or later on, for discrete time, we use n.

843
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,120
You refer to the time index.

844
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:20,640
But other than that, you can have some other parameter a.

845
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,760
a is the amplitude.

846
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:28,840
And this omega g log, which is from the cosine function

847
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,040
with frequency.

848
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,960
And phi will be the phase.

849
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,560
So for cosine function, you always

850
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:39,840
have these three, amplitude, frequency, and phase.

851
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:46,240
And then you need to know which one constant.

852
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,240
That means they are deterministic,

853
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,760
where which one is random.

854
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,880
Of course, in the normal deterministic case,

855
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,760
all of them, they are all constant, non-random.

856
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,400
So that's why we have the deterministic signal.

857
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:06,400
But assuming this example, omega 0 and this phi,

858
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,160
they are constant.

859
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,760
But a is a random variable.

860
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,120
Then once it's a random variable,

861
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,160
you try to know more.

862
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,520
Typically, we may be given a distribution.

863
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,440
So in this case, it will be a random variable uniformly

864
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,760
distributed, given that.

865
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,360
So now with this, we want to check whether this

866
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,080
is a weakly stationary process.

867
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:37,120
So these are the things, other than the conceptual level.

868
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,200
You need to build in the knowledge

869
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,440
and then gradually move on to see

870
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:49,760
how you can actually compute and verify mathematically.

871
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,600
And that's, I should say, probably part of the courses

872
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,760
where you'll learn and you will be

873
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:05,880
passed either in quiz or in the final exam papers.

874
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,120
Something similar, like given this,

875
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:14,280
and how are you going to apply the condition to check.

876
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,360
Then, of course, you need to be familiar with your learning

877
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,560
before calculus, how to do integrations,

878
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,720
and the very simple function, sine, cosine, and so on.

879
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:30,000
So for example, you do that by taking the mean first.

880
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,440
And then it turns out to be the mean is still

881
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,280
a function of t, then, of course, not a constant.

882
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,920
And this is, they don't need to check the other.

883
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,200
You only, if one of the conditions is not satisfied,

884
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:52,360
then you can stop here.

885
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,640
So again, coming to the same here,

886
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:00,440
but now if we make this phase now become random,

887
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,480
where the other two are constant.

888
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,480
In this case, it turns out to be, in this case,

889
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,800
it will be weakly stationary.

890
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,440
You can also verify.

891
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,080
And again, you're doing integration,

892
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,200
but you have to be careful to see.

893
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:22,560
You see here, the integration is with respect

894
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,160
to a, the amplitude.

895
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,720
From capital A here, once it becomes random,

896
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:35,360
you use a small letter to denote, which is available.

897
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:41,040
Then here is different, you see, is this phase is random.

898
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,440
So you integrate with respect to that.

899
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:48,440
And then you all know cosine signal

900
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:51,680
go over, integrate over one cycle.

901
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,680
It's independent of the phase.

902
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:58,360
It doesn't matter one cycle, one theory.

903
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,320
The mean is equal to zero, whether you

904
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:07,800
shift to pi over 4, pi over 2, and so on.

905
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,360
So that's how we get this.

906
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:13,920
But this is not enough, because you only verify one condition.

907
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,520
And then you'll need to, since the first condition is

908
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:20,640
satisfied, we continue to look at the second

909
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:26,560
to see whether, in this case, it turns out to be indeed.

910
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,200
You see, we're applying the t1 and t2.

911
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,320
And then, of course, t2 is t1 minus tau.

912
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:38,920
This is just differ by tau.

913
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,080
Then we want to see whether it turns out

914
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,400
to be a function of tau, or is there

915
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:49,600
depending on this t1, because t2 is already substitute by that.

916
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,200
But in this case, it's a little bit more complicated.

917
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,320
You need to know the trigonometric identity

918
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,160
to do integration.

919
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,680
So therefore, you can work out the equal to that.

920
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:07,000
Then, therefore, it's weakly stationary.

921
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,800
You can verify the other condition

922
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,680
is coming from these two.

923
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,520
So this godicity doesn't mean you

924
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:21,240
are able to take the mean, the tissue

925
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:25,760
mean using the ensemble, just using one realization.

926
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,360
But it's long enough.

927
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:41,960
There is another exercise, verify already provide

928
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,800
a solution.

929
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,160
So I think we can take a break here.

930
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:49,400
And then we'll continue.

931
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:55,240
And then by today, the subsequent part

932
01:10:55,240 --> 01:11:00,080
become more important and more mathematical,

933
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:09,600
which will be the important part of chapter 2 and chapter 3,

934
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:15,800
power density, spectrum, and so on, and model, and so on.

935
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,800
So yeah, we take a break.

936
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,880
Maybe you can come back at 8 o'clock behind.

937
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:29,760
7.55, just 14 minutes, a little bit shorter.

938
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,720
Same as before, it's one break, and we can finish early.

939
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,920
OK, any question?

940
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,400
Let me know.

941
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,300
OK.

942
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,300
OK.

943
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,300
OK.

944
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,300
OK.

945
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,300
OK.

946
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,300
OK.

947
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,300
OK.

948
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:16,300
OK.

949
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,300
OK.

950
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:16,300
OK.

951
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,300
OK.

952
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,300
OK.

953
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,300
OK.

954
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,300
OK.

955
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,300
OK.

956
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,300
OK.

957
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,300
OK.

958
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:16,300
OK.

959
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,300
OK.

960
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,300
OK.

961
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,300
OK.

962
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:16,300
OK.

963
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,300
OK.

964
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,300
OK.

965
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,300
OK.

966
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,300
OK.

967
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,300
OK.

968
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,300
OK.

969
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,300
OK.

970
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:16,300
OK.

971
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:21,800
OK.

972
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:29,800
So let's continue here from here.

973
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:37,800
I think from this part, we will have more math to.

974
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:42,800
And also, you go a link more towards what

975
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,300
you learned before, like DSP.

976
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:51,800
And part one, for example, you had Fourier transforms

977
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:57,800
and the Z transform, and so on.

978
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,800
But at the same time, we always assume

979
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,800
we are dealing with a random process.

980
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:10,800
So it's not just a deterministic signal, like sideways,

981
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,800
and so on.

982
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,300
OK.

983
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:19,800
So I will slow down a little bit from here.

984
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:33,300
OK, so now what we will discuss in this part two,

985
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:39,300
we'll always assume our random process is a stationary random

986
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:39,800
process.

987
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,800
And it's a weekly one.

988
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,800
It's not.

989
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:50,300
We don't need the joint PDF to be totally independent.

990
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:57,800
So what we require will be, as we point out early,

991
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:02,300
the means of this random process will be constant.

992
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:11,800
And then the covariant will only depend

993
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:14,800
on the other covariant.

994
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,800
Because we are talking about one random process,

995
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,300
or major different time.

996
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:25,800
It only depends on the time difference between t1 and t2.

997
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,300
We call it tau.

998
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:30,800
That's why here.

999
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,800
OK.

1000
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:38,800
So and therefore, you can compare

1001
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:44,800
in a sense about stationary random process

1002
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,800
is a little bit similar to sideways, where sideways

1003
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:52,300
deterministic, of course.

1004
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:59,300
But the signal energy is not finite energy.

1005
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:04,300
For example, you learn from the very basic signal and system.

1006
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:09,300
The theoretical signal is infinity energy.

1007
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:11,800
So it will be power type.

1008
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,800
So we call that as power type.

1009
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,800
Because why infinity energy?

1010
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:23,300
Each period, you'll have some, I mean, talking about sideways.

1011
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:26,800
Each period, you have some finite energy.

1012
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,300
But you'll have infinity many periods.

1013
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:33,300
So you'll multiply a constant, multiply infinity large value.

1014
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,300
It will become infinity large.

1015
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:40,800
So that's why we call it that.

1016
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,300
And stationary random process is similar.

1017
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:47,300
Because the process being stationary

1018
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:51,300
is more or less like keep the process,

1019
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,800
will not go to zero.

1020
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,300
Or it go to zero very slowly.

1021
01:29:55,300 --> 01:30:02,300
So therefore, it's infinity energy signal.

1022
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:07,300
So therefore, we cannot directly take a formation form

1023
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:13,300
of this, the whole random process,

1024
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:21,800
taking that as sequence signal.

1025
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:26,300
But on the other hand, it works only

1026
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:29,300
for stationary random process.

1027
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,300
For non-stationary random process,

1028
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,300
it may not have this property.

1029
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:38,800
So for stationary random process,

1030
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:44,800
you already know the autocorrelation function.

1031
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:51,300
It will depend only on the time difference of this time.

1032
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:56,800
And actually, this autocorrelation function,

1033
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,300
except, is no longer random.

1034
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:07,800
Because it's measure the average,

1035
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:14,300
try to find the average correlation between these two.

1036
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:19,800
The same random process at different time.

1037
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:26,300
So of course, the tau is now reduced

1038
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:31,800
from the two time interval, t1, t2, into just one tau.

1039
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,300
So you'll become like a 1D signal.

1040
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:41,300
And this autocorrelation, except, is no longer random.

1041
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:46,300
Even it come from random process.

1042
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,300
So this is very important.

1043
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:55,300
But as I emphasize, it only work for stationary random process

1044
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:57,300
if the process is not stationary,

1045
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:00,800
you will not have this property.

1046
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:06,300
So once we have this autocorrelation function,

1047
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:12,300
which is not random, then you can

1048
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,800
apply what you learned before.

1049
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:20,300
I assume by now, even if you did not

1050
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:23,300
learn DSP or signaling system before,

1051
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:27,800
after going through pro-wounds part one,

1052
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,800
and particularly you all finished assignment one.

1053
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:36,300
So you should know how to do at least this Fourier transform.

1054
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:39,300
All right.

1055
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:49,300
Here we are considering this tau is continue variable.

1056
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:52,300
For discrete time, you will need to do summation.

1057
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,300
So this is a very, very basic.

1058
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:57,300
Continue time, you'll do integration,

1059
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:59,300
Fourier transform.

1060
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:02,300
And then this is the very standard one.

1061
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:09,300
And that's why, because this very important,

1062
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:12,300
you see our autocorrelation function here

1063
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:15,300
is not just out of the proof.

1064
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:18,300
It's not a new sequence.

1065
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:24,300
Remember, this comes from a random process.

1066
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,800
It comes from a given stationary random process.

1067
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:31,300
So in this way, this Fourier transform,

1068
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:35,300
we define that as a power density function,

1069
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:39,300
power density spectrum of a random process.

1070
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:40,300
It's given by that.

1071
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:42,300
So that's a very important one.

1072
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:48,300
So keep this in mind, because this very basic definition,

1073
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:51,300
we will need that again and again

1074
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:56,300
in the subsequent weeks or chapters.

1075
01:33:56,300 --> 01:34:00,300
And once you have this Fourier transform,

1076
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:03,300
you can define the inverse Fourier transform.

1077
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:06,300
That's the very standard one.

1078
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:10,300
And here you can get 2 pi f.

1079
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:17,300
You can also combine that as omega, 2 pi f.

1080
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:22,300
So those are just the different notation.

1081
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:29,300
And then furthermore, there is a very important property.

1082
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:35,300
If you evaluate this tau, make tau equal to 0.

1083
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:37,300
So what do I get?

1084
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,300
You will go back.

1085
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:43,300
This tau equal to 0, that means this has become 1.

1086
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:49,300
e to the exponent power of 0 is equal to 1.

1087
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:53,300
So it will be just integrated.

1088
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:59,300
And that gives you a very useful relationship,

1089
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:03,300
because if you go back to the definition here,

1090
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:07,300
I mean, this one is what we evaluated

1091
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:13,300
by the second moment of this random variable.

1092
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:17,300
At any given time t, t can be different time.

1093
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,300
So don't get confused.

1094
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:22,300
The tau is at 0.

1095
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:26,300
That means it can be any t at the same t.

1096
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:40,300
So that gives you the average power of the random process.

1097
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:45,300
So therefore, we can see this function.

1098
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:50,300
The distribution of power is a function of frequency,

1099
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:58,300
because you integrate this over all the possible different frequencies.

1100
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:04,300
So that's the average power of this.

1101
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:15,300
So that's how we call this density function.

1102
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:24,300
And then you can also extend it to two random processes.

1103
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:29,300
But again here, we assume they are jointly stationary.

1104
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:36,300
So two different ones, you use the cross power density spectrum.

1105
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:41,300
And again, once you get this cross correlation,

1106
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:46,300
so again, the two random processes are different.

1107
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:53,300
But if you take time difference with time difference of tau,

1108
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:57,300
then it only depends on the time difference tau here.

1109
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,300
So you have this.

1110
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:05,300
So once this is well defined, you can again take the Fourier transform

1111
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:14,300
using this formula to get this cross power density spectrum also.

1112
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:19,300
And continue time, you use integration.

1113
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:24,300
Discrete time, you need to use summation.

1114
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:27,300
This is very basic rule.

1115
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:34,300
So here, you can, if you look at the discrete random process,

1116
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:39,300
not necessarily time, just discrete random variable.

1117
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:45,300
Then again, we assume it's stationary.

1118
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,300
Why saying stationary?

1119
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:54,300
So therefore, you get this, which now is also a sequence of m.

1120
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:59,300
Then you do the discrete Fourier transform,

1121
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:06,300
because this is discrete time.

1122
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:15,300
But however, in this case, this is not DFT, it's DTFT, discrete time Fourier transform.

1123
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:17,300
It's infinity long.

1124
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:25,300
So therefore, the frequency here still is a continued frequency variable.

1125
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:33,300
If you have a finite length, you become DFT, which gives you a discrete frequency.

1126
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:37,300
So that's a difficult part in signaling system.

1127
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:41,300
You have so many combinations, and it's very interesting.

1128
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:49,300
When I, for those students under SPML, I go through all your CVs.

1129
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:55,300
Typically, I find also signaling system is usually year two.

1130
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:59,300
You study signaling system first, then go to DSP.

1131
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:07,300
It turned out to be for most students, you get higher grade for DSP compared to signaling system.

1132
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:14,300
The main reason is maybe too many concepts, too many operations, too many properties.

1133
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:21,300
And the same as NTU here, we find second year signaling system, not so easy to teach.

1134
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:25,300
But then you come to DSP, it's more focused.

1135
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:31,300
You are focused in filters and so on.

1136
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:38,300
So coming back into that, so this is infinity sum of this sequence.

1137
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:49,300
The inverse Fourier transform is an integration because the f here is a continued frequency variable.

1138
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:52,300
So that's why you have this.

1139
01:39:52,300 --> 01:40:03,300
Similarly, if you make n equal to 0, which gives you the average power, it will be just let this term equal to 1, you'll get this.

1140
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:15,300
So now you can also work on some exercises.

1141
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:22,300
I think this example is what we did before.

1142
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:26,300
And now the random is this one.

1143
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:34,300
And then this W is defined as white noise random process.

1144
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:45,300
And then you have these two uncorrelated because we are dealing with white sense stationary.

1145
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:53,300
Then we have to determine the autocorrelation of the Y.

1146
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:59,300
Y is the sum of these two and also the power spectral density of this.

1147
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:08,300
So this is one of the very important examples.

1148
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:18,300
You pay attention on how to solve it.

1149
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:26,300
So we already showed this is white sense stationary.

1150
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:32,300
And this Wn is also white sense stationary.

1151
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:42,300
Then, following our early exercises, you can conclude this.

1152
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:56,300
The sum will be simply a sum of these two because they are, let's see, it's very important, they are uncorrelated.

1153
01:41:56,300 --> 01:42:00,300
If they are correlated, then they will be different.

1154
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:03,300
So you will have a cluster.

1155
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:08,300
Correlation, remember, is a second order property.

1156
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:14,300
So you need to do the power of two.

1157
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:25,300
But being uncorrelated, you can simply sum the autocorrelation of each of the X and W.

1158
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:31,300
So therefore, this one you know we already derived.

1159
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:41,300
For cosine, the autocorrelation will be a cosine independent of the phase.

1160
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:45,300
And for the white noise, it will be a delta function.

1161
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:48,300
So that is very important.

1162
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:55,300
Also, the white noise sequence, it keeps going on, you see, take the value, it's not zero.

1163
01:42:55,300 --> 01:43:02,300
But the white noise means that if only the delta function, so you know the meaning,

1164
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:08,300
is when n equals zero, it will be equal to, for this greater one, it's equal to one.

1165
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:10,300
And n not equal to zero is zero.

1166
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:16,300
So that means you only have, you only correlated to accept.

1167
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:27,300
As long as you take a different m and n value, one and two, or zero to one, so it will be zero.

1168
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:32,300
That's why I call it white.

1169
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:35,300
So this is the one here.

1170
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:44,300
Then now you take DTFT of this, because this is being described.

1171
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:48,300
This sequence is no longer random, you see.

1172
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,300
You can also see here.

1173
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:53,300
This is a proper cosine function of m, you see.

1174
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:55,300
There's nothing random here.

1175
01:43:55,300 --> 01:44:01,300
Similarly, this delta m is just equal to one, and m equals zero, and zero elsewhere.

1176
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:13,300
So then we can take DTFT of this, and in this case, we get the power spectrum density of Yn quite easily.

1177
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:24,300
And I hope you remember, for cosine signal, it will give you two delta functions at that frequency.

1178
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:27,300
And this delta function is different from this one.

1179
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:29,300
So don't get confused.

1180
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:38,300
A continuous variable delta function, this delta value means it's very infinitely large, you see.

1181
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:50,300
So those, if you still remember, the signaling system for delta t, for example, is infinitely large.

1182
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:53,300
But when you integrate, it becomes one.

1183
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:59,300
It's one impulse, singular value.

1184
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:08,300
Where this one is described time, this delta m, m equals zero is not infinity, it's one.

1185
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:21,300
So therefore, if you take the DTFT, then this one will just take the constant, because this is one.

1186
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:39,300
So this is what very basic we will learn in the subsequent chapter for power spectrum estimation.

1187
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:45,300
It will be based on this relationship.

1188
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:49,300
Any questions? Anything?

1189
01:45:51,300 --> 01:46:00,300
Now we move on to this more difficult concept, at least.

1190
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:14,300
But this, on the other hand, is also very important if you try to get a better understanding of stationary random process.

1191
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:29,300
So you see here, now we link to what you learned before, like Fiota's invertible linear system.

1192
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:41,300
So this part is a good combination of random process and proper linear system.

1193
01:46:42,300 --> 01:47:01,300
Actually, this so-called innovation representation is, we try to model this stationary random process.

1194
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:14,300
You can think about it is, the input is white noise, again, so you all know we are talking about discrete time.

1195
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:26,300
The input is white noise, then goes through a linear causal filter, then, of course we assume the filter is a proper one,

1196
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:39,300
it's not just a constant, then of course your output will be, if you go through a constant, then of course the white noise will produce another white noise.

1197
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:54,300
But if you go through a proper filter, which is the impulse response, then you all know the output of this will be a convolution of this white noise input

1198
01:47:54,300 --> 01:48:02,300
and the impulse response of this linear causal filter.

1199
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:13,300
So remember, I emphasized at the beginning, when we talk about system, the system or the filter is a proper one, is a deterministic one.

1200
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:21,300
Just take it as what you learned from part one or from your undergraduate DSP course.

1201
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:39,300
So this is very important, you can think about, in this case, you inject white noise and then go through a linear system, you will produce stationary random process.

1202
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:54,300
And then, if you recall, in the deterministic case, I think this is also very important, you introduce this impulse response.

1203
01:48:55,300 --> 01:49:07,300
So all about that, step one is, your input is a uni-impulse function, it's not random.

1204
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:24,300
Then you go through a linear causal filter, then the output is the meaning of impulse response, meaning the impulse function or signal goes through a filter,

1205
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:30,300
then the output is this, h of k.

1206
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:42,300
But now our input, we introduce white noise input, which is different from what you learned earlier, because this is random.

1207
01:49:42,300 --> 01:50:04,300
So in this case, you get the convolution, and this x of n here is precisely what we are trying to classify, because the stationary random process is still a little bit abstract, very hard to describe.

1208
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:14,300
So what we are doing here is, we already know property of white noise, and we already know linear causal filter.

1209
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:33,300
Then it happens to be, you're passing this as input, goes through this linear causal filter, then we precisely produce the output, which is of course not an impulse response, but it will be a stationary random process.

1210
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:40,300
And that's why we are using this innovation representation concept.

1211
01:50:40,300 --> 01:51:00,300
And furthermore, if you assume the filter, so this is very important, it is the inverse, if the filter, you take the inverse, that means if the filter, the g-load is also stable, it's within the unit circle.

1212
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:07,300
You can take the inverse, and it's also a property defined linear causal filter, then you can do the reverse.

1213
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:19,300
Now you have this stationary random process, making it as input, you go through that, then you produce output, which is white noise, so it's a reverse process.

1214
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:30,300
So this is, actually to be honest, it took me quite some time to digest and get a good understanding of this.

1215
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:36,300
Okay, so let's see how we handle this.

1216
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:45,300
So as usual, we assume we have this saying, which is a weakly stationary process, then you have the autocorrelation.

1217
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:50,300
So that part is not a problem, we know that by definition.

1218
01:51:50,300 --> 01:52:04,300
Then we can also take the power spectral density by, yeah, so this is a very important one, I believe you're already familiar.

1219
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:20,300
I need to emphasize again, the z-transform and Fourier transform, they differ by, z is a complex variable, it's a z-plane, it's a complex, a real part, imaginary part.

1220
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:30,300
And then for continuity, you look at the Laplace transform and the Fourier transform.

1221
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:44,300
But for discretized signal, we look at the z-transform, and you evaluate along the unit circle, so this is the unit circle.

1222
01:52:44,300 --> 01:53:10,300
Forget the Fourier transform, so this relationship from, again, I emphasize, from here to z, you just simply change f into this z variable by extending the one along the unit circle into a more general, complex variable.

1223
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:22,300
And, of course, vice versa is easier, once you get the z-transform, you let z equal to this, then it's easier, you evaluate along this.

1224
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:38,300
But sometimes you are given power spectral density, which you need to express as this, it will be always a function of this complex variable, then you identify this, replace by z, you will get this.

1225
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:54,300
So this is a big similar, you learn DSP, or signaling system, you have the relationship of z-transform and the discretized Fourier transform.

1226
01:53:54,300 --> 01:54:04,300
Where z-transform is referred to the discrete sequence, discrete time sequence, not continuity.

1227
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:17,300
So now assume this is lower and continuous for all this, here is a normalized frequency of 1 over 2.

1228
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:24,300
And then we also assume, now be careful, this is a function of z.

1229
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:39,300
If you take the log, assume, you take log is still analytic, and that means you have, you can take derivative of many, all the order, 0, 1, 2, and so on.

1230
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:59,300
In a newer region, I mean this region is, remember z is a complex plane, so you have two rings, one is R1 and the other is R2.

1231
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:17,300
And then these rings must include the unit circle in the middle, because R1 is smaller than 1, and R2 is greater than 1, so that means the R equal to 1 is inside this ring.

1232
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:27,300
So therefore, once you satisfy this condition, you can take the Laurent series.

1233
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:52,300
So Laurent series differs from the normal series, you expand it to the z-transform, but the power is not just 0 to say the minor infinity large.

1234
01:55:52,300 --> 01:56:09,300
It covers all the possible powers, m is from minor infinity to infinity, that means if this is analytic, it can expand here, because this is a function.

1235
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:26,300
So just like you expand it into infinity series, and then we get this coefficient in the series expansion.

1236
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:55,300
Okay, so that means, so I emphasize this, I repeat this again, this is a proper analytic function, but assume we can expand it, satisfy this series, instead of looking this as a function, we can make it just infinity sum of this, and then at the same time we get the coefficient is depending only on m in the expansion.

1237
01:56:56,300 --> 01:57:11,300
So therefore, in this case, you can also see this is a sequence with z-transform of this, if you compare with the formula in the z-transform.

1238
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:30,300
Okay, so therefore, now going back, remember, once you have the z-available, you can evaluate along the unit circle, this is unit circle.

1239
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:55,300
Then we get somehow substitute this, it will become like the frequency variable, and then from here you are getting the inverse Fourier transform, where this looks like the Fourier transform.

1240
01:57:56,300 --> 01:58:21,300
Therefore, this looks like b, it's the Greek letter of b, this is a Fourier coefficient, if you are expanding this, this is a theoretical signal, because you evaluate by unit circle, every one circle, one time, you repeat, keep going.

1241
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:33,300
And then you can see, we assume our filter is a real coefficient, so therefore this is a real and even function of that.

1242
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:43,300
Then we can see this is also real, and it's a symmetry also for all the m.

1243
01:58:44,300 --> 01:59:07,300
So therefore, if you look at equation 51, you see here, you can, this is very important, you see, summation, if you take the summation topic into three terms.

1244
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:17,300
Then one is a Z log, you see, you have this Z log, you get the summation, m always goes through the Z log in the middle.

1245
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:28,300
And then, if you look at those positive index, you see, so starting from Z log, you go to the right side, it will be m from one to infinity large, you will get it.

1246
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:51,300
Similarly, on the other side, you will have minus one to minus infinity, but we change the variables, we make the minus m, we call it again also m, so don't worry about that, you see the power is now changed from minus m to m.

1247
01:59:51,300 --> 02:00:14,300
So that means the index, you want to get a good understanding, you first call it k first, k equal to minus m, then after that, the k is the index, m is the index, you call back m, because it's a summation anyway, the index.

1248
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:35,300
So therefore, this is what we are looking for, you see, so for this one, because this is a constant, e to just one value, we call that as sigma w power two, making this as like the value of the noise.

1249
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:58,300
And then, you see here, this is only, it depends only on Z to the power minus m, so we call that as H of Z, and similarly, you see, the difference between this one and this one is only Z, if you call this,

1250
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:20,300
so we always define Z to the power of minus index as calling H of Z, so don't get confused, and then, if our Z now is all positive, we call it Z to the power minus one, so this is a convention for filters,

1251
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:30,300
also, we always take Z to the power minus one, minus two, and so on, but we normally define H of Z, where the other one is the opposite.

1252
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:55,300
So you see here, this is borrowing from the log manipulation, we managed to see this one can decompose into one positive constant, and the product of this H of Z, and H Z to the power minus one, so this is a very important concept.

1253
02:01:55,300 --> 02:02:17,300
So that means through this filter, you can get the output, which is expanding the power density spectrum into this, from F change to Z, you will get the relationship from here.

1254
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:45,300
Okay, and our H of Z is just equal to that, and here, we assume this is causal and stable, with all the poles within this, because, remember, we required this condition in our early derivation,

1255
02:02:47,300 --> 02:03:03,300
and then, if we further assume this given filter, you see, also has all the zeros inside the unit circle, and by definition, this is, we call it a minimum phase.

1256
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:11,300
So I think in some filter discussions, sometimes you discuss this, but not often.

1257
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:27,300
Here, in our contact, it's very important, this minimum phase means all the zeros are also inside this, because, why? Because later, you will see we need to inverse the filter, so the zeros will become poles.

1258
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:36,300
And if the zeros are inside that, I mean, once you inverse this filter, you also get a stable causal filter.

1259
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:43,300
Okay, and then, we also assume it doesn't have zeros on this.

1260
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:59,300
And finally, if we have this, you know, as a function of Z, now we change it, evaluate along this unit circle, we will get this relationship.

1261
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:18,300
Well, another important result, if you are in the Z domain, so one is function of Z, and then here you change Z to the power of Z to the power of minus one.

1262
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:37,300
So the coefficients are all the same, only the variable changes, but if you evaluate along the unit circle, then this Z to the power of minus one, the function, you will be just the complex conjugate of this edge of F.

1263
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:49,300
So this is very important, you have this relationship only along the unit circle F, not for the general Z, so be careful.

1264
02:04:50,300 --> 02:05:06,300
And you all know the property, you have a product of these two, that means you are taking the absolute value of the magnitude raised to the power of two, because this is a complex number.

1265
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:10,300
A complex function, you have this relationship.

1266
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:22,300
So therefore, here we can conclude the weakly stationary random process, I think, can be represented as output of causal filter.

1267
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:41,300
Then, which filter? It depends on either you specify a random process, you will get the corresponding filter, or vice versa, once you define a causal filter, then you inject white noise, you will produce a stationary random process.

1268
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:49,300
It's not arbitrary, it's related by this, when you excite with the white noise random process.

1269
02:05:50,300 --> 02:06:00,300
And this one, the value of this white noise is just equal to this, so this is a very important concept.

1270
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:13,300
And then, in general, if you are talking about the edge of J is not the rational function, it will be very hard to handle.

1271
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:25,300
So in practical applications, typically we will restrict the power density of this weakly random process.

1272
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:42,300
It's a rational function, so that will be easier, and that's how, in this case, we can get a filter linked to a via filter more closely.

1273
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:48,300
And then, we also assume the rules of this, our inside unit circle.

1274
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:56,300
That means, you all know how to get the rules for polynomial, the z-plane.

1275
02:06:57,300 --> 02:07:11,300
So therefore, the linear filter, you see, so remember, when we talk about power spectral density, they always have this pair, bj multiplied by bj to the power minus one.

1276
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:24,300
But when we talk about linear filters generating this, we are only taking this bj over aj.

1277
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:36,300
That means a proper rational function involving, for example, here is always delay, so it will be a causal filter.

1278
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:41,300
But if you combine these two, there is no causal one.

1279
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:47,300
And this concept of being causal or not is also very important.

1280
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:54,300
And then, this is coming back to our normal FIR filter.

1281
02:07:55,300 --> 02:08:10,300
I think part one doesn't discuss much. It's mostly on FIR filter, but I assume you'll learn DSP, like this, extending FIR filter to IR filter.

1282
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:17,300
It's just from polynomial to rational function, so it's a little bit more complicated.

1283
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:27,300
Okay, so these are the filter coefficients, and we'll determine the location of the Z log and poles of this.

1284
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:32,300
So any problems so far?

1285
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:52,300
So this innovation concept is just a bridge to link wide-sang stationary random process and linear filter and, of course, the wide noise, so the three of them in one.

1286
02:08:53,300 --> 02:09:01,300
Okay, so coming back to some, these are more related to DSP.

1287
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:10,300
Here, our hj is causal, stable, and minimum phase. Assume this is satisfied.

1288
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:16,300
Minimum phase being the Z log, except also within the unit circle.

1289
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:20,300
A filter can be stable, but not minimum phase.

1290
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:27,300
You know filter, being stable or not, we only look at the poles of the filter.

1291
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:33,300
We don't care the Z log, the location of the Z log.

1292
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:42,300
But if you are inverting this filter, now it becomes very important, so we require this minimum phase.

1293
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:45,300
Remember, minimum phase?

1294
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:57,300
Okay, so if you satisfy this, then you'll take the inverse, this is a rational function, you take the inverse, stay a rational function.

1295
02:09:57,300 --> 02:10:02,300
It's also causal, stable, and minimum phase, the linear system.

1296
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:17,300
So therefore, you can see the random process uniquely represents the statistical property of the innovation process, WN.

1297
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:32,300
So the WN here is white noise, but because this is related to our random process by going through the stationary random process.

1298
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:42,300
So that means you can think about one stationary random process, it corresponds to one special white noise.

1299
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:50,300
Because white noise, you can also have different behavior.

1300
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:57,300
That's why sometimes we can have two white noise which are independent, uncorrelated.

1301
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:00,300
So yeah, don't get confused.

1302
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:10,300
So in that case, the innovation process is specifically linked to one of the random processes.

1303
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:15,300
That's why we call it uniquely, and vice versa also.

1304
02:11:16,300 --> 02:11:25,300
Okay, so any questions here? Anything you get confused?

1305
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:38,300
If not, then we can continue here. These are somewhat easier.

1306
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:48,300
So now if we look at an example, we have a causal, stable, minimum phase linear system.

1307
02:11:49,300 --> 02:12:11,300
So you need to learn how to identify, given the product of this, you need to figure out which part is the minimum phase and the other one is not.

1308
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:25,300
So you can check both the zeros if you look at the two factors here.

1309
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:32,300
So if you look at this one, the zeros of this will be equal to 1 over 3.

1310
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:40,300
So therefore, it meets our requirement of being minimum phase.

1311
02:12:41,300 --> 02:12:46,300
Of course, the poles you also must make sure are within the unit circle.

1312
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:54,300
So in this case, it will be 0, 6, because 0, 6 multiplied by 1 over 0, 6 will be equal to 1.

1313
02:12:55,300 --> 02:13:10,300
But this one is not, because the zeros of this one is 3, because 1 minus 3 over 3, because this is to the power of z, not to the power of z, z to the power of minus 1.

1314
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:23,300
So therefore, given the product, you need to identify which one is gz, and the other part must be g to the power of z, to the power of minus 1.

1315
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:45,300
And now we can extend this concept further to the case where the input is one random process, goes through a linear system, then goes through the output.

1316
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:55,300
So you learn this part. Always try to learn, although it's different, because here we are dealing with random signals.

1317
02:13:56,300 --> 02:14:02,300
But some of the concepts are very closely related to the case where you are dealing with DSP.

1318
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:12,300
For example, let me go back to DSP. You have unit impulse as a special input.

1319
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:21,300
You go through a linear system, you generate the unit impulse response as output.

1320
02:14:22,300 --> 02:14:27,300
So this unit impulse response, in a sense, categorizes your linear system.

1321
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:34,300
And once you get that, you can change the input to other types of input.

1322
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:41,300
It can be a unit step function, or even a square wave, and so on.

1323
02:14:42,300 --> 02:14:51,300
But in that case, the output will be another output. It will no longer be the unit impulse response.

1324
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:54,300
You will need to do the convolution.

1325
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:59,300
And similarly, in the z domain, it's the same.

1326
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:06,300
If you inject a unit impulse response, the z transform is of that one equal to 1.

1327
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:09,300
So the output is just equal to h of z.

1328
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:19,300
So that's why, if you look at the input, it's white noise only here.

1329
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:29,300
The output is just mainly determined by the filter transform function or the frequency response.

1330
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:35,300
But in the case of a random variable, we are always handling second-order statistics.

1331
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:42,300
So you need to, instead of h of f, you will become absolute value, raise power to that.

1332
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:47,300
So that's the difference and similarity.

1333
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:53,300
So in a sense, we have a similar relationship.

1334
02:15:53,300 --> 02:16:07,300
If now the input is not just white noise, but proper, white things stationary, stationary process,

1335
02:16:08,300 --> 02:16:12,300
you get autocorrelation function and the z transform of this.

1336
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:23,300
Then, you can see the output of this going through this filter will be h of z multiplied by h z to the power minus 1.

1337
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:27,300
Then, you need to remember the multiplied by this.

1338
02:16:28,300 --> 02:16:37,300
So again, if you go back to the normal deterministic signal, you only have h of z.

1339
02:16:38,300 --> 02:16:40,300
That's a relationship.

1340
02:16:41,300 --> 02:16:46,300
But now, we're dealing with stationary process.

1341
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:51,300
They always come out with this product.

1342
02:16:52,300 --> 02:16:59,300
And then from here, as I say, you need to know the relationship from z to this.

1343
02:17:00,300 --> 02:17:07,300
So you substitute this, you go back to this part, the same as what we did before.

1344
02:17:08,300 --> 02:17:19,300
Except this one here, you will get a proper so-called power spectrum density of this.

1345
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:27,300
W here is another general white things stationary process.

1346
02:17:30,300 --> 02:17:41,300
Again, as an example, so this is, you see, we look at now, w of n is a stationary process.

1347
02:17:42,300 --> 02:17:49,300
We have this autocorrelation function, which is non-ringdom.

1348
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:55,300
You see, it's an intake of n, n is absolute value of n.

1349
02:17:55,300 --> 02:18:00,300
So that means it's a symmetry, positive, negative, you get the same value.

1350
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:04,300
And also, we assume this constant, smaller than 1.

1351
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:08,300
Then, first we need to compute that.

1352
02:18:09,300 --> 02:18:16,300
And then, after that, we have a simple linear system, which is here.

1353
02:18:16,300 --> 02:18:22,300
Then we excite with this, w n.

1354
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:33,300
If alpha equal to half, we determine the power density spectrum of this, autocorrelation of this, and also the value.

1355
02:18:34,300 --> 02:18:37,300
So let's see what we can do here.

1356
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:43,300
First, we can get the z transform of this.

1357
02:18:43,300 --> 02:18:52,300
So this is also an example to illustrate what I derived early in the innovation representation.

1358
02:18:53,300 --> 02:19:06,300
In a sense, similar, you see, when you're dealing with infinity sum, the index from minus infinity to infinity, it's better to break down into either two sums or three terms.

1359
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:13,300
So here, we look at the negative one first, which is n minus infinity to here.

1360
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:19,300
But, so you see here, for this alpha, the n is absolute value.

1361
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:27,300
So you always, for the negative one, you will get minus n, being absolute value.

1362
02:19:28,300 --> 02:19:32,300
And for the z to the power minus n, you keep the same index.

1363
02:19:33,300 --> 02:19:38,300
Now the other part, you see, n from zero to infinity.

1364
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:49,300
This one, you take absolute value, you become alpha of n, because n now is a positive index, so you don't need absolute value.

1365
02:19:50,300 --> 02:19:55,300
But the z is, based on this formula, is always to the power minus n.

1366
02:19:56,300 --> 02:20:03,300
And then, you see here, I want to try to combine these two.

1367
02:20:04,300 --> 02:20:05,300
So how do you do that?

1368
02:20:06,300 --> 02:20:10,300
You look at this. This one is n from zero to infinity.

1369
02:20:11,300 --> 02:20:13,300
This one is starting from minus one.

1370
02:20:14,300 --> 02:20:21,300
So I need to add one more constant term, like m equal to zero, into this one.

1371
02:20:22,300 --> 02:20:25,300
So that your one term will become m.

1372
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:29,300
First, you change the variable. That's a very trivial one.

1373
02:20:30,300 --> 02:20:32,300
You see, all these are minus n.

1374
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:36,300
If you want to be sure, don't get confused.

1375
02:20:37,300 --> 02:20:40,300
You let minus m into k first.

1376
02:20:41,300 --> 02:20:47,300
Then after that, you become k, and k is from zero to here.

1377
02:20:48,300 --> 02:20:51,300
Then after that, you change back, because we want to combine these two.

1378
02:20:52,300 --> 02:20:58,300
But since you add one term, the constant term, which is equal to one, you add minus one here.

1379
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:04,300
So therefore, this minus one comes from adding one more term.

1380
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:16,300
And now, these two, you can use the geometric summation to sum these.

1381
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:24,300
And since our alpha is absolute value smaller than one, it converts into this.

1382
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:27,300
Similarly for this one, it also converts.

1383
02:21:28,300 --> 02:21:32,300
Then this is a simple combination.

1384
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:36,300
The denominators are not the same. You have three terms here.

1385
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:41,300
You make them as common denominators.

1386
02:21:42,300 --> 02:21:48,300
Then a very simple algebraic will leave it to you to work out.

1387
02:21:49,300 --> 02:21:55,300
You can see this combined into this one.

1388
02:21:55,300 --> 02:22:03,300
But you must have a z to the power of minus one, and the one z to the power of one.

1389
02:22:04,300 --> 02:22:08,300
Because in this expression, you cannot cancel out one of them.

1390
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:11,300
So that's why you have this term here.

1391
02:22:12,300 --> 02:22:16,300
Now, this is what you can do.

1392
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:31,300
I don't think you can further simplify. It's already in one rational function of z to the power, z to the power of minus one, and z to the power of one.

1393
02:22:32,300 --> 02:22:38,300
However, if you are trying to get the power density spectrometry, this is in the z domain.

1394
02:22:38,300 --> 02:22:47,300
To do that, remember always substitute z to the power of e to the power of z to pi f.

1395
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:50,300
So this is evaluated along the unit circle.

1396
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:58,300
And then, once you do that, then you can see, I hope you know the Euler formula.

1397
02:22:59,300 --> 02:23:13,300
How to convert from e to the, let me see whether, I can see whether this one still work or not.

1398
02:23:14,300 --> 02:23:16,300
Okay, maybe it works.

1399
02:23:17,300 --> 02:23:22,300
Yeah, so let's see whether, I can switch.

1400
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:26,300
Okay, so we have one here.

1401
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:43,300
So, see here, if you have z equal to, looks like, I don't know why, it can't rotate, okay good.

1402
02:23:47,300 --> 02:23:54,300
Yeah, it looks like an inverse.

1403
02:23:59,300 --> 02:24:07,300
I hope this is, this time is, okay, okay, correct, this I auto-focus.

1404
02:24:07,300 --> 02:24:31,300
Again, if z equal to e to the power of, e to the power of j two pi f.

1405
02:24:32,300 --> 02:24:43,300
So what happen, then of course, z to the power of minus one, you see, you change the minus j two pi f.

1406
02:24:44,300 --> 02:24:53,300
Because if you are along the unit circle, you see, and that's precisely this become the, remember, conjugate, you see.

1407
02:24:54,300 --> 02:24:57,300
So that's how the conjugate also come from here.

1408
02:24:57,300 --> 02:25:04,300
Now if you substitute into that, all the other are constant, so we don't care.

1409
02:25:05,300 --> 02:25:21,300
What we have here is alpha, then we multiply by e to the power of minus j two pi f plus e to the power of j two pi f.

1410
02:25:22,300 --> 02:25:31,300
So this is what we have, the very famous Euler formula.

1411
02:25:32,300 --> 02:25:41,300
You have this complex sideways, complex exponential signal, divided by two.

1412
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:49,300
That will give you the cosine, you see, no longer j, it will be two pi f.

1413
02:25:50,300 --> 02:25:53,300
So that's how this come from.

1414
02:25:54,300 --> 02:26:04,300
Therefore, of course, we don't have divided by two, then if you multiply two to the other side, it will produce this.

1415
02:26:05,300 --> 02:26:11,300
So this is the term when you substitute z into this using this Euler formula.

1416
02:26:12,300 --> 02:26:22,300
So that will become cosine two pi f multiplied by two, because we don't divide by two, then you move the two over there.

1417
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:24,300
So the rest will be the same.

1418
02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:34,300
So this is a very useful relationship, you should know how to derive and apply.

1419
02:26:36,300 --> 02:26:38,300
Okay, so let's continue.

1420
02:26:39,300 --> 02:26:43,300
And then, in that case, our z transform.

1421
02:26:44,300 --> 02:26:56,300
So see here, you go back, so here you need to be familiar with how to juggle between z and f by looking at the formula.

1422
02:26:57,300 --> 02:27:02,300
So therefore, you have h, z, and this part.

1423
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:08,300
Now if you look at the z domain, we have the h, z, then you have this.

1424
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:16,300
Now you want to go back to the power density of this, you move on to the z, change the e to this.

1425
02:27:17,300 --> 02:27:41,300
And then you have, again, because due to this property, you simplify, you end up with, you all become like the term here, become cosine, like cosine two pi f.

1426
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:50,300
And then, you use trigonometric identity, you can make it cosine pi f power of two.

1427
02:27:51,300 --> 02:27:53,300
So that's another relationship.

1428
02:27:54,300 --> 02:28:02,300
So the denominator looks very similar, although the values are different.

1429
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:15,300
So that's how you, so this part we already done, but the other one is similar, you can substitute and accept numerator difference here.

1430
02:28:16,300 --> 02:28:24,300
So I hope you try to digest, and this part is new in this year.

1431
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:35,300
This year, previous year, I only write this in the notes, so I think it may be helpful by putting it into lecture notes.

1432
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:47,300
So therefore, if you do the partial fraction of this, you can, that's again a simple mess.

1433
02:28:48,300 --> 02:28:54,300
I hope you know how to explain from the product into sum.

1434
02:28:54,300 --> 02:29:03,300
And then, once you explain the sum of two terms, you need to determine this a and b.

1435
02:29:04,300 --> 02:29:16,300
How to do that, you add the two again to become the same denominator, and then compare coefficient, you're able to get this a and b.

1436
02:29:17,300 --> 02:29:28,300
So therefore, you get this a equal to that, b equal to that, so therefore you can explain it into the sum of two terms.

1437
02:29:29,300 --> 02:29:38,300
And then, directly, now you try to make this into the same form as what we derived earlier.

1438
02:29:39,300 --> 02:29:53,300
You can check, like, consider there is a formula, the Z-transform formula, then you can get the relationship, so you end up with this.

1439
02:29:53,300 --> 02:30:01,300
And finally, from here, the output value, your value m equal to zero, so therefore this becomes one.

1440
02:30:02,300 --> 02:30:10,300
You get any node zero value raised to power zero, it will be equal to one, so you're simply adding this to become 25.

1441
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:21,300
Okay, I think we still have some time. We can go through the final part of this linear system.

1442
02:30:22,300 --> 02:30:35,300
The several process are AR, MA, and ARMA. So this is very much related to IIR filters, so I hope you have some knowledge.

1443
02:30:36,300 --> 02:30:45,300
But anyway, next week, we will still go through in more detail, so this is more like an introduction.

1444
02:30:46,300 --> 02:30:56,300
So this is like the IIR filter, or you look at the difference equation, you have this denominator, this is a numerator.

1445
02:30:56,300 --> 02:31:10,300
So depending on whether you have all the coefficients, node zero, or some of them become just one, you have three processes, AR, MA, and ARMA.

1446
02:31:10,300 --> 02:31:23,300
So first, this is AR. AR is one, just poles only, the denominator only, so the numerator is a constant, that is easy.

1447
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:32,300
And therefore, this is all poles filter, the relationship is just like that.

1448
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:48,300
Then, from here, you can see the noise-whitening filter, for generating this innovation is an all-zero filter, because this is all poles.

1449
02:31:48,300 --> 02:31:56,300
This is all poles, and you take the inverse, it will be A of Z, then the denominator equal to one, it's all zero.

1450
02:31:57,300 --> 02:32:10,300
So, yeah, and then we move on to the case moving average, MA. I mean, if the denominator equal to one, a constant, our filter, you just have the numerator.

1451
02:32:11,300 --> 02:32:23,300
And if you have numerator, this is what you should be familiar, the FIR filter probably spent quite a few weeks talking about that, and your assignment is like that, so I'm sure you do that.

1452
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:35,300
And vice versa, you want to do a noise-whitening filter, you take the inverse, it will become all poles. So this MA and AR, they are just inverse of each other.

1453
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:46,300
Finally, this is more general one, MA is the, you have a proper numerator and denominator, so you explain it, you have this and this part.

1454
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:58,300
And then, now, if you want to inverse, of course, your A of Z denominator become numerator, and similarly, numerator become denominator.

1455
02:32:59,300 --> 02:33:06,300
And that's why this is pole-zero filters, you have proper poles, proper zero.

1456
02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:18,300
So in order to make sure the inverse is also stable and causal, you have to satisfy the minimum phase condition.

1457
02:33:19,300 --> 02:33:29,300
So again here, we want to briefly introduce the relationship between filter parameter and autocorrelation sequence.

1458
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:46,300
So this is the part where you need to mix up, combine different knowledge, again here, because differential equation, I think you all know, this is nothing random here.

1459
02:33:46,300 --> 02:33:50,300
Again, it's just a proper IR filter.

1460
02:33:51,300 --> 02:34:03,300
But now, we start to introduce this correlation, because remember the input sequence here, W and X, they are in the sense random.

1461
02:34:03,300 --> 02:34:13,300
So being random, we can, for example, we multiply by XN minus N, so you see.

1462
02:34:14,300 --> 02:34:24,300
So therefore, now that you apply this expectation, so this right here is expectation is like taking the mean, it's very important.

1463
02:34:24,300 --> 02:34:48,300
So therefore, once you take expectation, then based on the definition, this give you this, and remember our process is stationary, a wide sense stationary random process, then we can get autocorrelation.

1464
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:54,300
Similarly here, and this is a cross-correlation.

1465
02:34:55,300 --> 02:35:07,300
And then we know the relationship XN, then we can also show how to handle this, you see here.

1466
02:35:07,300 --> 02:35:23,300
You have this, and then this is the, you know, the W goes through a filter, produce H of N, so we have this convolution, substitute that here.

1467
02:35:24,300 --> 02:35:34,300
And then, you can bring in the expectation inside the H, because this is not random, you see.

1468
02:35:35,300 --> 02:35:44,300
So remember, not random, you can bring it outside the E, but those part random, you cannot, so this is a very basic property.

1469
02:35:44,300 --> 02:35:55,300
So therefore, you're bringing in, and this is being white noise. White noise means, you see, it will produce delta functions.

1470
02:35:56,300 --> 02:35:59,300
So that's delta function, the value equal to that.

1471
02:35:59,300 --> 02:36:21,300
And so therefore, this equation, you can simplify into this, so that means from the difference equation here, we know the coefficient here, then we can work out the relationship of the autocorrelation.

1472
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:39,300
And here, the cross-correlation, because of the spatial WKs, we don't have here, we only need this, so that means this gives you the similar relationship with the difference equation.

1473
02:36:40,300 --> 02:36:42,300
So not the same, but yeah.

1474
02:36:42,300 --> 02:36:51,300
And also, take note of this, we are assuming we are dealing with causal filter, causal filter means H N equal to zero for this.

1475
02:36:52,300 --> 02:37:02,300
So therefore, you end up with our autocorrelation of X and X, it has three forms.

1476
02:37:03,300 --> 02:37:09,300
If N greater than Q, you only have this part here, so that's easy. This one is zero.

1477
02:37:09,300 --> 02:37:19,300
But if N is between zero and Q, you will need to take this, this part is no longer zero, you have to bring this on here.

1478
02:37:20,300 --> 02:37:30,300
But how about N is smaller than zero? Remember, autocorrelation is always even function, so you can get from the other side, you only need to work half.

1479
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:33,300
So that's the relationship.

1480
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:40,300
Okay, finally, the exercises here.

1481
02:37:40,300 --> 02:38:04,300
We want to, it's similar to the example given early, maybe I don't have to give the solution here, maybe I give you time to do while waiting for pass.

1482
02:38:04,300 --> 02:38:20,300
So perhaps we dismiss a little bit early, it's very similar to the exercises early, but you want to make sure our omega here is just 2 pi F.

1483
02:38:21,300 --> 02:38:37,300
But now the order is a bit higher, so you need to think about how to change from the unit circle into the Z variable, so get the AR process and also that.

1484
02:38:37,300 --> 02:38:49,300
So you can do that then, maybe next week we can come back and check, probably some of you can show your solution.

1485
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:55,300
We try to interact at least for those who come here.

1486
02:38:55,300 --> 02:39:05,300
Okay, so I think the time is up, so I promise you to end a little bit early than 9.20.

1487
02:39:06,300 --> 02:39:16,300
So any questions? Of course, there are always some students staying back, so it's not early time for me, early time for most of you.

1488
02:39:16,300 --> 02:39:26,300
Okay, you have questions? Stay back. If not, then you take your time to do these exercises.

1489
02:39:26,300 --> 02:39:37,300
So next week we come back, we move on to Chapter 2, as I said before.

1490
02:39:38,300 --> 02:39:47,300
Okay, I'll see you next week. Don't forget the quiz will be Week 12.

1491
02:39:50,300 --> 02:39:53,300
I'll see you next week, and thanks for coming.

1492
02:39:56,300 --> 02:39:58,300
