1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 All right. First of all, sorry, I went to the wrong room. Sorry, I didn't know that

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,080
 this course is actually not fine. I believe all of you are here for 6401, right? Advanced

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,160
 digital signal processing. Okay? At least I'm in the right room now. So hopefully,

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,040
 we should have already given you an introduction last week. All right? So how many of you were

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,040
 here last week? Okay, great. All of you are here. So you probably know basically what

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,040
 you're expecting for this course, right? And I wish to emphasize this again later in the

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,280
 slides, because you are still in the end-and-job period. In other words, if you don't find this

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,040
 course suitable for you, you can still drop it, right? But we do need some, you know,

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,920
 basics. I mean, we do need you to have some background on signal processing to take this

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,960
 course. The reason is that if you look at the title of the course, it says advanced digital

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,280
 signal processing. In other words, you should have some background on signal processing

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,520
 in principle, right? So, I mean, so think about it, because we do have some students before

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,520
 reflected that everything is so hard. And so if you think this course is too advanced,

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,520
 you can also consider dropping that, right? So I mean, the reason I'm mentioning this

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,520
 is, you know, it's now still time for you to think about it, all right, before it's too

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,520
 late. But anyway, let me start this lecture first. Oops.

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,280
 Don't sign. Skip it.

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,280
 Got it.

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:49,280
 Of course, advanced signal processing.

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,280
 Lecture one. All right, great.

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,280
 Oops. All right, so let's start. Sorry that I'm late for five minutes, because I thought

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,780
 it's in the soft spot again. You know, I will note that, you know, this year actually we

23
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,920
 got more master students. So I think that's the reason we have to schedule here. So basically,

24
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,160
 this is your second week, right? Propheting was covering the first week. So I will be

25
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,079
 covering all the remaining lectures before recess week. So basically, I'm going to talk

26
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:33,480
 about the main contents for, you know, signal processing, filtering, filter design, and

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,760
 also multirate processing. So my name is Bi Han. You can call me Bi Han, or Wen, I mean,

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,799
 either way. So I'm the system professor at the School of Triple E. And you can find my

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,840
 information, my email, my homepage here. So, you know, this is a course maybe quite classic,

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,240
 right? So it's mainly for signal processing. And we're going to focus on digital signal

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,400
 processing. So I believe some of you may also take an analog signal processing for your

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,400
 during undergraduate. All right, so kind of show of hands how many of you are like EE

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,320
 background, like electrical engineering background, or maybe like control or, you know, at least

34
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:15,400
 not computer science, all right? Okay, how many of you are from, I don't know, computer

35
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,400
 science, math, or other kind of discipline, which you have never done signal processing?

36
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,000
 We have a few. Okay, so any of you like never heard of signal processing? Like you do not

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,720
 know what is signal, what is system, what do you mean by processing? Okay, so the reason

38
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,000
 I'm mentioning that is that I do know that all of you coming from quite diverse background.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,680
 Okay, so that's why, you know, you are realized that for this week and next week, what I'm

40
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,680
 doing is basically help you to review and recap on some of the, you know, basic knowledge

41
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,680
 about signal processing. So today I go through like the DTFT, you know, this create for your

42
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,160
 transform, while you know, aliasing, right, you know, errors. So this may be very obvious

43
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,400
 for some of you, especially for those who have already taken the digital signal processing

44
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,520
 undergrads, right? So you can treat this as some review, you know, in case you, I mean

45
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,840
 too, for you to refresh your memory, refresh your memory. But for those of you who find

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,880
 the things I'm talking about today, you know, not familiar, right? You find like everything

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,760
 is quite new to you. You probably need to look at, you know, learn more from, let's

48
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,320
 say, textbook, because you probably have not taken any course in signal processing in

49
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,720
 your undergrads. So you need to get those basic knowledge in order to learn the new things,

50
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,560
 you know, in the future weeks. All right. So kind of do it, treat this as a checkpoint

51
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,400
 for yourself, right? So to evaluate whether you are pretty much know a lot or you need

52
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,560
 to catch up, right? It's okay to, you know, not knowing too much about signal processing,

53
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,200
 but you need to spend more time to catch up, right? This is what I want to say. So we do

54
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,080
 have a textbook. I believe you can find them in the library, but it's not something compulsory.

55
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,479
 In other words, even if you don't read the textbook, you follow the slides I'm talking

56
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,359
 about, maybe later, Prof Lin is going to talk about, it should be sufficient for exam for

57
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:14,400
 this course. But if you wish to go beyond what we talk about, you want to learn more,

58
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,360
 or you want to catch up to maybe kind of learn those things you haven't learned undergraduate,

59
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,760
 you are more than welcome to check the textbook. All right. So this is what I, the reason I'm

60
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:30,520
 mentioning here, so we do have one, but it's not compulsory. Okay? So, oh, by the way,

61
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,880
 for my course, at least for my half, you can ask a question anytime. Okay? You don't have

62
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,920
 to wait until the end. Of course, you can ask me questions during the break. So we're

63
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,360
 going to have a break, maybe in one hour, okay? Because it's a three hour lecture, it's very

64
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,960
 long, right? So we're going to have a break. So you can ask me, or you can ask me anytime.

65
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,880
 So now if you have a question, don't hesitate, raise your hand. I can answer your question.

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,240
 I actually prefer you to ask me. Anytime you have any doubt, you have questions, because

67
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,400
 that probably means I didn't get things clear. Right? So ask me, don't wait, don't wait until

68
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,120
 too late. All right? So ask me anytime. You can interrupt me if you have a question. Okay?

69
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:16,320
 So this is our textbook. So this is like our plans for my part. I cannot speak for profanity,

70
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,880
 but for my part. So basically the first two lectures, right, this week, next week, you

71
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,400
 can consider as some review or kind of an introduction to the fundamental of digital signal processing.

72
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,240
 So today I'm going to talk about what is the sampling process. In other words, how can

73
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,400
 we convert analog signal? Or in other words, continuous time signal to discrete time signal,

74
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,039
 right? Sampling process. Mathematically, what does the sampling mean? Right? And also,

75
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,800
 how can we represent signal, especially discrete signal, in frequency domain? The reason is

76
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,040
 that everybody loves frequency domain because frequency domain tells you more about the signal.

77
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,200
 It's a better representation for you to understand, for example, where it is income from, how can

78
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,760
 you design your filters, right? So you need to get yourself familiar with frequency representation

79
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,480
 because you're going to use that for the whole subject, all right? And also that's why we

80
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,920
 use all of these kind of transforms, right? Later you will have continuous time for your

81
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,480
 transform, discrete time for your transform. All of these transforms you heard is to convert

82
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,360
 time domain signal to frequency domain, right? That's all the purpose. The reason is that

83
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,880
 we believe frequency representation means can represent more information. They are better

84
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,280
 for us to analyze, okay? So we'll talk about how we can represent them in frequency domain.

85
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,880
 And the next week we're going to move on to this processing, right? Today we'll be focusing

86
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,039
 on signal, you know, how can we sample signal, how can we represent signal? Next week, it's

87
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,760
 going to review the processing. In other words, the system, right? How can we design the system

88
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,320
 to process the signal, like low pass, high pass, band pass, and all of these kind of

89
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:05,520
 filtering, right? And something new is that, okay, we know how to, we know how we want

90
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,560
 to process the signal, but how can we exactly design the filters to do things as we need,

91
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,159
 right? So we'll talk about filter design. How can we design the filter that exists in

92
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:23,599
 practice, not just theoretically, but existing in practice, okay? So we'll talk about filters

93
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,359
 in lecture three. Lecture four and five, right? Last but not least, one of the very important

94
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,280
 things for, at least my part, is still going to teach you the multi-rate signal processing.

95
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,480
 How many of you heard of multi-rate processing? I mean, there's a mono-rate, there's a multi-rate

96
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,560
 signal processing. How many of you heard of multi-rate processing? Okay, not too many.

97
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,560
 How many of you heard of wavelets? Okay, you heard of wavelets, okay, very good. So wavelets

98
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,480
 is very popular, and wavelets is actually a multi-rate signal processing tool, right?

99
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,080
 If you look at how you design this low, low pass, low high pass, it's actually keep dividing

100
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,880
 the signal into half and half, right? The thing we're doing this division is nothing

101
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,600
 but introducing multi-rate processing, okay? So later, you know, the last part of actually

102
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,600
 my half, we'll be focusing on multi-rate processing, we're going to deal with, you know, increase

103
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,720
 the sampling rate, decrease the sampling rate to process the signal in different rates,

104
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,520
 basically, and we're going to teach you what is the reason of doing that, right? There's

105
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,560
 a reason we're going to do it, okay? But these will be mainly the components for my part,

106
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,560
 okay, like how many, five lectures in total, right? And you're going to have a homework,

107
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,560
 okay, by the end of the week five, okay, which is the second last week before recess. The

108
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:48,560
 homework will be just a bunch of questions. You can do it at home, but we have a deadline,

109
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,079
 so I'm going to give you like a week, or maybe I don't know, a week and a half for you to

110
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,360
 do it, and you're going to submit them through NTU Learn, and I'm going to grade it. So it's

111
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,360
 going to be 20 percent, all right? So it's a reasonable portion of the marks, all right?

112
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,360
 So, and also, I mean, this one, maybe we don't have it, but we're trying, I will try to,

113
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,760
 I mean, maybe I don't have an extra saving, but I will set up some time for you to ask

114
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,600
 me questions, especially, you won't see me again in the second half, right? So maybe

115
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,800
 in the last week, if you have any questions, I will leave some time for you to ask me before

116
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,160
 maybe towards the end of the exam, right, final exam, okay? And then, you know, after

117
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,160
 recess, we're going to have profiling back, right? He's going to teach you something else,

118
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,160
 like IRR, you know, this kind of field design, which, you know, wait for his part. So in

119
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,160
 total, right, you know, marks, you know, this is also important for you because this is

120
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,839
 going to affect your GPA. So 100 percent, that's the total marks we have. We do have a final

121
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,560
 exam, right? Final exam is the most important thing, 60 percent, okay? So it's very standard,

122
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,800
 but I don't know, how many of you are first year here? Or maybe, let me ask you the other way,

123
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,840
 how many of you are not first year? I mean, how many of you have been here already, like,

124
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,640
 semesters? Okay, but you have done some exam, right? So you know how the exam works. So basically,

125
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,880
 if I know exam is maybe similar as you did, maybe in your home country, like, you just sit

126
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,720
 there, we have a time for you, you come and see it, we give you three hours to do, like,

127
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,480
 six questions, all right? Very formal, very standard, but, and then of course, that's 60 percent,

128
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,720
 okay, final exam. But before that, we have two continuous assessments, right? Basically, before

129
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,200
 exam, we have two assignments, like homework. So I will give you one, profiting will give one,

130
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,960
 so each of them works 20 percent. So that's how you can get your final score, right? 40 percent

131
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,160
 coming from, coming from two assignments, 60 percent coming from exam. So exam is important,

132
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:51,319
 you have to prepare for exam, but also CA is also important, okay? So this is all you need to do,

133
00:11:51,319 --> 00:12:03,880
 to get the marks, okay? Any question? Yes? Exam, you mean? Yes, close book, close book. So final

134
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,079
 exam will be close book, homework you can check, I cannot control, I mean, you can read your book

135
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:15,000
 if you want, but most likely homework will be more difficult, okay, as expected, because you can,

136
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,240
 check your textbook, right? So homework, you can read whatever you like, use a computer, use a

137
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,280
 textbook, whatever you like, but final exam will be close book, okay? Good question, yes?

138
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:39,160
 Oh, okay, good question, good question, table formula. We haven't decided yet, but if we need you to

139
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,839
 use some formula, those will be provided, okay? So if, let's say, there's a question,

140
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,160
 for example, I need you to do a Fourier transform for, let's say, Zinc function, right, Zinc function,

141
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,839
 nobody knows what's the transform, but we're provided, right? The purpose of having the exam is not to

142
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,880
 ask you to memorize it, it's ask you to apply there. So we do not know yet, we're going to set the

143
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,520
 question very soon, but not yet, if there's an in use formula, we're going to provide it. So don't

144
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,880
 worry, don't need to memorize those very weird functions, how you do transform. So they will

145
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,880
 provide it if they are needed, okay? Good points, any other question?

146
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,760
 Sorry?

147
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,319
 What are you going to publish this time? The first one?

148
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:25,880
 Oh, the first one, okay, good question, I just mentioned, right? The first assignment will be

149
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:34,439
 announced in week five. So this is week two, week five will be, how many? Three, four, five, so three

150
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,680
 weeks from now. It's not due time, due time will be before recess, okay? So the reason I announced

151
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,880
 later is because you need to have the knowledge until week five to do it, so I didn't announce now,

152
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,760
 it doesn't make sense to announce now, but it's going to be announced in week five, provided that

153
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,680
 all of the knowledge you need will be already covered, okay? Good, any other questions? Yes?

154
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:04,040
 So it's not a quiz, you mean who said that?

155
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:08,439
 Oh, Professor Lin said it's quiz, oh no, it's homework actually, it's homework,

156
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:12,839
 maybe he got it wrong, so it's not a quiz, it's homework, but again, you know, 20%, right? You

157
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,479
 have to be serious about it, so it's homework means you can bring home, you can do it at home,

158
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:22,359
 but you have to submit before deadline, so I'll give you a deadline, maybe give you a week to do it,

159
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:28,520
 maybe a couple days more, so you don't have to come here to do it, but you have to do it at home

160
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,800
 and give me the reasonable answers, okay? Good, any other questions?

161
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:46,600
 No more? Okay, great, so I can move on. So, okay, some useful information before I move on, right?

162
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,840
 So as I mentioned in the very beginning, these course do need some math, okay? Unfortunately,

163
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:58,920
 unfortunately, they do need some math, so, you know, we are trying our best to minimize the

164
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,520
 requirement of the math, in other words, we don't really dump you with all of the formulas,

165
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,520
 but still, you need to have basic mathematics, I believe maybe all of you should have that,

166
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,880
 but you know, you do some evaluation, right, whether you are comfortable with the level of

167
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,280
 math, but we do need to have some math to teach the course, so if you feel like very uncomfortable

168
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,000
 with the math, you may think about it because that's something you need for the entire subject,

169
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,080
 all right? So, we will provide the, you know, notes every week and every week, I'm going to

170
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,480
 quickly review what we talked about previous week for you to do a recap, meanwhile, if you have

171
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,360
 questions you can ask, right, I will provide the chance to ask questions, and for some of you,

172
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,840
 maybe a good option for you to form groups among students to learn, you know, study together,

173
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,880
 right, that's a common strategy people use, so this is just a suggestion for you, and like I said,

174
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,880
 if you have a question, I strongly encourage you to ask immediately, just now I think some of you

175
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,600
 did a quite good job, right, so don't wait because if you wait, you may forgot your question, so it

176
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,600
 doesn't make sense to wait, right, so if you have any question, or maybe you spoke about the type

177
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,360
 of what I have in the slides, right, feel free to let me know, you know, I'm happy, you know,

178
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:16,360
 if you ask me, rather now, rather than later, okay, so yeah, so some of you, like, and then some of

179
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,120
 you may be very strong, you know, I don't know, because I also participate in the, you know,

180
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,400
 application review, right, so some of you are graduated from very good universities, you have

181
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,920
 really good GPA, oh sorry, GPA, so you may have already know this, right, sorry, I'm using GPA

182
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,040
 every day, so anyway, some of you have really good GPA, so you probably find these are something

183
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,199
 pretty old for you, so well consider this as a review, right, but you will find new things

184
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:46,040
 starting from the week after next week, I promise that, we do have recording, so you see there's a,

185
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,400
 is there recording, I think there's a recording, right, so the recording will be posted online,

186
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,160
 right, have you found the recording for week one, okay, so means it's going to record,

187
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,560
 means that you can replay, in case you are absent for some of the weeks, it's fine, you can still

188
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:08,359
 watch the recording, right, this is the, it's good for you to do a recap later, and it's going to be,

189
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:13,399
 it's going to be made available after the lecture, okay, so these are some of the information,

190
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:17,800
 all right, so now let's move on to the actual content this week,

191
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:27,000
 oops, okay, so like I mentioned, right, we, for this course at least, we are going to focus on,

192
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,080
 you know, this quick signal, in other words, digital signal, right, because all of the signals

193
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,040
 stored in the computer, your phones, they are not analog, but of course our real signal in

194
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,159
 nature, they are analog, for example, when I talk, my acoustic signal is analog signal,

195
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,720
 my view of this kind of environment is going to be analog signal, goes to my mind, right,

196
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:57,000
 but how can we actually convert analog signal to digital signal that can be stored or can be

197
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:06,600
 transmitted in the digital system, right, so we need to have a pipeline to process or to convert

198
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:13,320
 continuous time signal to digital signal, so this is actually a very typical pipeline,

199
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:19,959
 where you can see that the signal comes in not directly to the processor, right, so consider

200
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:24,439
 this process as, you know, maybe your computers, your phone, which are actually processing the

201
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:30,120
 system, so before passing the signal to the processor, you have to have this two stage,

202
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,919
 right, the first stage would normally refer as A2D, right, analog to digital conversion,

203
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,440
 the second stage is actually D2A, convert digital back to analog signal, you have to have these two

204
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:48,680
 stages, but you may also realize that there are actually two modules, right, beyond just AD or DA,

205
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,320
 okay, the first module, which is the very first module, we call it anti-adiasing

206
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,400
 filter, how many of you heard of the term anti-adiasing filters? Anyone heard of the term?

207
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,960
 Oh, I'm surprised, okay, we have some, you never heard of AD-Azing, okay, that's why I think you

208
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,400
 have to pay attention for today's review, okay, because AD-Azing is a big problem for many many

209
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,840
 application like communications, you know, image processing, nobody wants AD-Azing, okay, the whole

210
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,440
 idea of designing a system to be good is to prevent AD-Azing, right, so later I'm going to teach you

211
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,800
 what exactly, what I mean by AD-Azing, but because of that, we have to have this something called

212
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:34,200
 anti-adiasing filter to avoid AD-Azing, so AD-Azing is kind of distortion, kind of error that we do

213
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,280
 not want, so we want to get rid of it, right, so, but basically later I'm going to teach you that

214
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,480
 anti-adiasing filter is nothing but a low-pass filter, okay, but you have to design the low-pass

215
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,280
 filter to the way that it's going to kill the AD-Azing, all right, so, but this is something

216
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:57,000
 we have to have, it's before the A2D converter, right, before analog to digital conversion,

217
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,080
 there must be anti-adiasing filter, okay, it's before, then, you know, we can do this A2D converter

218
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:13,720
 to convert a, you know, like a conscious time signal to a finite amount of discrete signal,

219
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:21,400
 and this A2D process is actually referred as sampling, okay, so you keep here the name sampling

220
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,400
 like many, many times for this subject, but sampling is nothing but conversion from analog

221
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,440
 to digital signal, right, so we are going to use sampling to represent this process for the entire

222
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:39,720
 subject, right, so once you do sampling, we are getting the digital signal, and we can apply

223
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,080
 the DSP system, right, digital signal processing system to process the discrete time signal,

224
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,440
 and this will be the main focus for this course, not today, right, but maybe starting from tomorrow,

225
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,080
 we're going to learn how we can design this DSP process, right, in the way we want,

226
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,480
 and in the way that's going to be practical, all right, so it's going to be going to be the main

227
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,000
 focus, but of course after you process the digital signal, we have to convert it back to the real

228
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,240
 life, so that's why we also have to have this inverse process, right, like digital back to

229
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:18,200
 analog converter, which is nothing but reconstruction of the analog signal from the digital measurement,

230
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,560
 so it's the reverse process of the A2D, right, now we have to do D2A, and when we do this reconstruction

231
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:32,360
 process, we also have to have this extra filter, we call it reconstruction filter, the reason is to

232
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:40,280
 make sure in the output, all of these so-called other components beyond the bandwidth can be

233
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,800
 somehow eliminated, so we only evaluate the baseband signal, later on we're going to see what do we

234
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,800
 mean by baseband signal, but to do it, only D2A is not important, not enough, you have to have the

235
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:58,760
 last one called reconstruction filter to get rid of the replicates, right, only keep the baseband

236
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:05,560
 signal, so also the last filter is also low pass filter, but it has to be there, right, so now you

237
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:11,240
 can see that in the beginning we need a low pass filter, it's called anti-aliasing, okay, in the

238
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,120
 end we also need another low pass filter, it's called a reconstruction filter, okay, so these two

239
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:23,320
 are also something like a mast in the pipeline, on top of the A2D and D2A, right, so the four things,

240
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:29,400
 together with the DSP system, form the classic pipeline of signal processing, all right, so this

241
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,200
 is something like an overview of what we're talking about, when we say advanced signal processing,

242
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,880
 right, and these fundamental blocks are actually common, right, no matter we are talking about

243
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,000
 audio signal processing, image signal processing, even NLP, right, text processing, these pipelines

244
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,560
 are common pipelines, so you have to have them, but of course the actual digital signal processing

245
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:56,120
 will be different, but the way we convert analog to digital anti-aliasing reconstruction, these are

246
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,600
 common, right, so what we are learning today will be applicable to all sorts of applications,

247
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:09,000
 right, this is a common pipeline, all right, so you know just now we say that you know that's

248
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,520
 the common pipeline, and the reason we want to do this DSP is to basically, you know, once you

249
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,600
 have a signal, right, the reason we spend a lot of time designing this DSP, the objective is to

250
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,600
 extract information from the signal, all right, so there's a difference between information and the

251
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,320
 data or signal, right, so we're dealing with a lot of signal nowadays, right, you have, you know,

252
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:37,640
 every time you use your phone, you are receiving many many kind of signals, right, but information

253
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,960
 may be still limited, right, what you want is not the signal themselves, what you want is the

254
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,480
 information, so this is the whole idea why we need to process them, right, the idea is to process the

255
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,320
 big amount of signals and only extract information you need, right, this is the whole reason we want

256
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,240
 to process it, and that's why we need a DSP algorithm, which is going to depend on the type of

257
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,360
 signals we're talking about, and also the characteristics of the information that is

258
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,399
 carried by the signal, for example, if you want to, for example, you want to focus on certain bandwidth,

259
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,159
 maybe that bandwidth is the only meaningful part, the other bandwidths are noise, right, how can we

260
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:21,959
 denoise, how can we extract those bandwidths, you need to know where the signal is, what kind of

261
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:27,080
 frequency this signal has, right, so if you know the characteristics, you can design the corresponding

262
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,120
 bandpass filter to select the useful bands, right, so this is actually one of the principles

263
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:38,360
 of designing the algorithm, and also we need to have multiple ways of representing the signal,

264
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,320
 so later we're going to look at all sorts of transforms, and the tool of them is to represent

265
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,879
 a signal in the right domain, right, right frequency, right spectrum, right, so that's why we need to maybe

266
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:56,840
 be familiar with both the time representation, like you represent a signal as a function of time,

267
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,080
 as well as representing the signal as a function of frequency, right, different kind of frequencies,

268
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,240
 because maybe one of them is good for you to extract information, some of them may not be so

269
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,520
 obvious, right, this is the reason we need so many transforms, okay, and also, you know, one of the

270
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:19,399
 common methods we use to design a processing system is by filtering, okay, I believe all of you

271
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:23,240
 should know filtering, right, if you're taking a basic signal processing, you may have heard of

272
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,919
 filtering, right, it's a kind of the basic components of a system, right, filtering, and the

273
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,360
 filtering could play different roles, right, for example, some of the filters may choose to pass

274
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,840
 certain frequency components, right, you may have heard of high pass filter, right, low pass filter,

275
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:46,440
 it means only these frequency range will be survived in the processing, will either be killed, okay,

276
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:52,040
 also there could be some filter they try to block certain frequency, right, maybe like a band stop

277
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,200
 filters, they only survive the rest of the band, those band signal will be killed, right, so this

278
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,120
 is actually where the name come from, so it depends on the function, the filters may preserve some

279
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,720
 components, they may also kill some of the components of the signal, right, and for this course, we're

280
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:16,040
 going to focus on digital filters not only for moderate, so most of the filter you learned before

281
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:22,200
 may be moderate, right, but we also focus on multirate filters, right, in other words, the

282
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,720
 filter can deal with the signal maybe in a faster sample version or maybe in a slower sample version,

283
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,200
 right, for some reasons, maybe for efficiency, maybe for effectiveness, right, so this is also part

284
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:39,160
 of things we're going to learn, okay, and like I said, right, the basics of DSP is important,

285
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,880
 which you learn in the first three weeks, so the first three weeks will be quite fundamental,

286
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:51,080
 but they are very important, if you do not know like the basic formulations, basic terminologies,

287
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,880
 you will have some difficulties when you learn the more advanced topics, right, in the future,

288
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,160
 I mean, in a week four or five, six, okay, so don't kind of feel like a very, very relaxed,

289
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,000
 even though you know them, I strongly encourage you to still pay attention, all right, because

290
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,320
 fundamental is always important, okay, so starting from sampling, right, just now I'm saying that

291
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:17,160
 sampling is nothing but converting analog signal to digital signal, right, in practice, you can

292
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:23,800
 imagine a sampling process as a sampler, right, like this, maybe I use a pointer, like this,

293
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:30,600
 so you can consider a D2A system like analog signal coming, okay, so how to represent analog

294
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:37,399
 signal, you represent it as a function of T, right, so here the T will be a continuous number,

295
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,960
 they can take every value, like you know, you know, doesn't really have to discretize, all right,

296
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:51,960
 and after this sampler, which means only, sorry, only with certain time, maybe the multiple time of

297
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:58,120
 the period, time step, the signal can pass, right, other time instances, the signal will be killed,

298
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:04,360
 so this is actually a sampling process, so after the sampling process, right, your output will no

299
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,480
 longer be a continuous time signal, so normally we will represent the so-called discrete time signal

300
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:16,680
 using a variable not like T, but like N, right, so by default, T normally means is a continuous

301
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:23,240
 variable, all right, and will be a discrete variable, means N will be integers, okay, so I

302
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,480
 believe all of you know the difference, right, discrete, continuous, right, discrete means,

303
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,840
 for example, you can only take A, A minus, B plus, there's nothing between A minus and A, right,

304
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,240
 this is discrete, continuous means your score, right, it can be 98, it can be 98.2, right,

305
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,200
 so you can take every value between it, discrete means there's only a certain value you can take,

306
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:50,520
 all right, so after the sampling, your representation will be like XN rather than XT,

307
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,800
 all right, so this will be something by default N will represent discrete variable,

308
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,560
 T will represent continuous variable for this subject, okay, and if you want to visualize the

309
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,720
 signal, right, continuous time signal will be a continuous function, right, in this, you know,

310
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,920
 2D plane where this is your signal, this is your time axis, it's going to be continuous,

311
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:18,200
 dense everywhere, right, but discrete signal will be not continuous, the only sample at say,

312
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,480
 you know, T, 2T, sorry, 0, T, 2T, 3T, 4T, like the integer value of the period, only those

313
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,360
 NT times, T time step will be sampled, otherwise it will be 0, right, so this will be the big

314
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,120
 difference, so this is like illustration of the sampling process, so there are two important

315
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:43,159
 two important variables you have to pay attention, one is the upper case T, all right, so upper case

316
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:51,320
 T will be the sampling period, okay, sampling period means only when the time equal to integer

317
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:59,159
 multiple of T, there is a value in the discrete signal, means like, you know, how separate the

318
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:04,840
 two bars are, right, T actually describes the distance between two bars, two time steps,

319
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,439
 the larger the T, the sparser the discrete signal will be, all right, so the T will describe how

320
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:16,679
 you do the sampling, okay, you can represent T in the other way called sampling frequency,

321
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,600
 FS, right, FS is nothing but 1 over T, right, it's a reciprocative of T, it's the same thing,

322
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:29,000
 but you can represent either as T or FS, which is 1 over T, it's the same, but either of them

323
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,480
 will describe the sampling process, it's important, it's going to categorize how fast you sample it,

324
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:40,760
 how frequently you sample it, okay, so this is the only variable for sampling, so every time when

325
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,320
 people say, hey, I'm doing sampling, you have to ask yourself what is the T or what is FS,

326
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,440
 without knowing it you have no idea how the sampling is conducted, okay, so this is actually

327
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:56,360
 sampling, so mathematically, right, you can define the signal, you know, continuous time

328
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:02,760
 signal as xA, analog signal, A stands for analog, equal to maybe for example, let's just choose a

329
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:11,560
 cosine signal as for example, right, and if you sample it, it's going to convert xT into a xN,

330
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,840
 right, I mean the simple way to do that is just replace T with N times T, remember,

331
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,879
 only when T equal to N times T there's a value, otherwise it's zero, so you simply just swap

332
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:27,879
 the variable from T to N times uppercase T, right, that's the sampling process, as I mentioned,

333
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,480
 uppercase T means sampling period, FS means sampling rate, so these two will be uniquely

334
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:43,320
 describing the sampling process, okay, okay, so T and FT, these are actual sampling frequency and

335
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:51,640
 actual period, we can also normalize them in the way we can represent them, for example,

336
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:59,480
 instead of using FS, you can represent the smaller, sorry, lowercase, lowercase f as the

337
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:06,520
 normalize sampling frequency, and I mean the reason we want to do that is to make sure the f is

338
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:13,720
 actually within zero and one, okay, in principle you can design any uppercase f you want, you can

339
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,520
 something very, very fast, but because the dat number can scale like from very small number to very

340
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:24,440
 big number, you want to make them normalize, you can actually normalize it to make it within zero

341
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,280
 and one, okay, it's the same but just the scale, you just scale it, so every time we use lowercase f,

342
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,639
 it means normalize frequency, and lowercase f can be only within zero to one, right, that's the only

343
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:40,520
 difference, and if you multiply by two pi, you can make it, you know, radiate, right, rather than

344
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,440
 hertz, it's just change of units, but you have to differentiate the uppercase f with the smaller

345
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:53,880
case f, this is important, all right, any questions so far? Yes?

346
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,920
 Why the time can be, oh, okay, good question, so you are saying that how can we understand the time

347
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:08,200
 in the past? Well, in principle, you can have signal in the past, right, that's the first thing,

348
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,800
 later we're going to get there, so there's something called causality, causal signal versus

349
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:17,879
 non-causal signal, right, then there's a difference in terms of future time and the past time,

350
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:23,000
 but mathematically, a function can have variable with negative number in principle, right, so we

351
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,520
 didn't limit to the t to be positive-negative, but sometimes if we consider the signal, is it

352
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:35,080
 practical or not, then the time matters, right, mathematically, you can make it general, right,

353
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:40,840
 so t larger than zero is future time, t smaller than zero is actually past time, right, nothing

354
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:49,800
 prevent you of doing that, okay, good, yes, uppercase f, you know, fs, right, so sampling rate,

355
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:59,240
 oh, this f, okay, so this f is the, how to say, what's the frequency within the, how should I say,

356
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,280
 what's the frequency within the sampling rate, so for example, if my sampling rate is, let's say,

357
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:10,679
 1000 hertz, right, but why we present, let's say, the frequency bandwidth, frequency spectrum, right,

358
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:16,360
 you can actually represent any frequency within it, so this, you know, uppercase f is the actual

359
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:22,360
 frequency, but if you normalize f with the total sampling rate, it's going to be normalized frequency,

360
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:29,000
 so the small f is not equal to fs, but it's going to be a frequency that is normalized within the

361
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,280
 sampling range, okay, so later we're going to talk about why we care about the sampling rate,

362
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,920
 because sampling rate actually limits the baseband, right, because only, you can only represent the

363
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:45,320
 frequency within fs, which is the baseband, beyond that is actually the replicates, all right, but

364
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:53,800
 the value of f, the small f, can be only taken within one, so it cannot go beyond one, okay, great,

365
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:01,160
 any other questions? Am I running too fast? It's okay, right, if I'm running too fast, you

366
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,440
 can, I mean, all you think I'm running too slow, I can also speed up, all right, okay, good, because

367
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,040
 I need to, I need to also learn from you, right, because, you know, every batch still doesn't

368
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,040
 are different, so I need to understand whether my pace is okay, so let me know, right, if you have

369
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,760
 any feedback or comments, because the whole idea is to make you learn, right, if you don't really

370
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,280
 can learn anything, it's actually my problem, so I have to, you know, adapt to it, right, okay, so

371
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,640
 this is actually how we do A2D, right, sampling is going to do analog to these digital signals,

372
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,280
 but the question is, can we design a sampling arbitrary way? In other words, can we sample

373
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,120
 the signal in any way we like? In principle, you cannot, right, there's a risk, right, the risk

374
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:52,120
 happens at the time if your sampling rate is too slow, right, you cannot have enough information to

375
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,440
 like, well represent the actual signal, right, this is also reasonable, if your sample rate,

376
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,839
 like, the signal is very slow, but the signal changed too fast, you didn't capture the change,

377
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:08,120
 right, you have to make sure the sampling is sufficient, right, so what can be wrong if my

378
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:15,000
 sampling rate is too slow, okay, so this is one example, say for example, if I fix my sampling

379
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,920
 rate, the rate is on the right, but I have two different signals, right, top one and bottom one,

380
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,040
 so even though the analog signal is very different, you can tell it's a different signal, right,

381
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,319
 but if you don't have sufficient sampling rate, you can end up with exactly the same discrete

382
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:41,000
 signal, so different analog signal, because you are sampling too slow, they can be represented

383
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 exactly the same, which means you are not representing the signal right, because they should be

384
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,360
 different, right, so if your representation cannot capture difference, it means you have a huge

385
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:57,160
 representation error, right, so this is where the problem comes from, so you have to have a sampling

386
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:03,319
 rate that is reasonable such that two different signals in the analog domain can be different

387
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,759
 you know, differentiated in the frequency, sorry, in the discrete domain, right, so this is where

388
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:15,319
 the idea comes from, if you have this kind of scenario, that means something is wrong, you lose

389
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:22,520
 information in the sampling process, all right, so because in the end, right, remember after your

390
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:29,400
 process, you still have to reconstruct the analog signal from the digital domain, right, so you

391
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,880
 have to make sure when you represent a continuous time signal, they can be recovered later, uniquely

392
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:42,360
 and well recovered, right, this is where, I mean, the objective we have to design the system, right,

393
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:50,280
 so in this case, you can treat the digital form, the thing on the right, xn, as an approximation

394
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:56,840
 of the xt on the left, okay, of course it's always an approximation because you lose something, right,

395
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:03,560
 but you want to make sure the approximation gives you an acceptable accuracy or acceptable error

396
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:11,960
 such that you can well represent it, okay, but of course you can always have a super high sampling

397
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,400
 rate to make it very good, but there you have to pay the price for the computational cost, right,

398
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,840
 the faster your sample, the more computation you need, so basically we're talking about the tradeoff,

399
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:29,480
 you know, between the accuracy, how well you will represent the signal and how much you pay for the

400
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,040
 computation, right, this is a tradeoff, you pay more, you get better representation, but then you

401
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,080
 have to pay the price, you pay less, you may lose the signal in the beginning, right, so this is the

402
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,520
 tradeoff, the thing we're learning here is what is the right, how should I say, what is the minimum

403
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,440
 requirement of the cost such that we can still recover the signal in a reasonable way, so this

404
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,759
 is what we're going to learn, you know, next, all right, but you understand where the problem

405
00:38:54,759 --> 00:39:01,560
 comes from, it's a tradeoff, you want to make sure the sampling rate is not too low such that

406
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:08,040
 signal can be still recovered, but how to determine this requirement, what is the, what the way we

407
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,920
 say not too low, what do we mean, right, what is the minimally required sampling rate, right,

408
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,200
 this is actually something we wish to know, right, and this one linked to, oh sorry, before that,

409
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,440
 right, so okay, like I said, there are two components which are important, frequency,

410
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,920
 sampling frequency, right, we need to make sure it's not too low, actually before that, there's

411
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:32,600
 another thing also need to be considered is the number of bits you use to store the value, right,

412
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,600
 something like a quantization, you have to, you cannot store the value in the infinite

413
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,720
 precision, right, also the bits also matters, but like I mentioned, because of this tradeoff,

414
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:48,520
 you have to make sure that this FS number of bits cannot be too low, neither too high, right,

415
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:55,879
 too low or too high will give you some kind of a cost, right, you have to bear, so the idea of this

416
00:39:55,879 --> 00:40:03,160
 design is to make sure the original signal can be recovered from its digital version with acceptable

417
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:10,120
 distortion, error, in other words, so this distortion is actually dominated by aliasing,

418
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:16,440
 okay, this is where the aliasing comes from, aliasing is the distortion caused by, you know,

419
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,920
 not sufficient sampling, insufficient sampling, all right, so just now, in the beginning I asked

420
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,319
 you how many even knows aliasing, most of you didn't know, so this is a definition,

421
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:33,080
 aliasing is nothing but the error, the distortion caused by insufficient sampling,

422
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,000
 okay, so here I show you the exact formula, right, but that's the concept, right, so here's

423
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:46,040
 actually the exact derivation, okay, so mathematically, just now we say that you can convert a discrete

424
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:52,520
 time, sorry, continuous time signal to discrete time signal by simply, you know, changing the T

425
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:58,600
 with N times uppercase T, right, so this will be the digital signal, and of course you have this

426
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:04,760
 parameter T and FS, which are basically the same equivalent to represent a sampling, right,

427
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,560
 and we know that sampling frequency is 1 over T hertz, right, and also you can do the radius,

428
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:15,240
 radian sampling if you want, times 2 pi, right, so the frequency domain representation,

429
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,440
 we know, I mean all of you know this, right, how many of you never heard of even like a

430
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,000
 continuous time for your frequency, sorry, continuous time for your transform, how many of you have

431
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,560
 never heard of even CTFT, all of you know that, right, so I don't have to repeat, okay, so there's

432
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:39,240
 something called a CTFT, which can convert a CT analog signal to frequency representation,

433
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:45,000
 it's called Fourier transform, but it's going to deal with CT, all right, and this is the formula,

434
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,600
 okay, so I sure, do I need to explain this, or all of you know,

435
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,560
 okay, I saw all of you know it, if you don't know it, come to me, I can explain for you,

436
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:01,400
 all right, after the break, but what we care about is actually the DT version, all right,

437
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:08,520
 so CTFT deal with continuous time signal, so basically the function here on the right hand side

438
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:16,040
 is GA, is analog signal, you can do a Fourier representation of this guy, get the corresponding

439
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:23,480
 frequency spectrum GA, all right, but that's for CT, now we have to deal with DT, because for

440
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:30,360
 this subject, BT will be the focus, there is a corresponding version of CTFT called DTFT,

441
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,080
 so the only difference is that on the right hand side, you realize the time domain signal is actually

442
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:45,480
 not a GT, but the GN, all right, and because the A is not continuous, you cannot do integration

443
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,880
 anymore, right, how can you do integration over a discrete signal, you have to replace

444
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,160
 integration with summation, right, summation is the counterpart of integration when you have

445
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,680
 discrete signal, so you will see that the change is from the integration to summation,

446
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:06,840
 the range is still like from minus infinity to infinity, the base will be changed, right,

447
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:12,920
 here is actually omega t, but here is small omega, small omega means the frequency in the DTFT domain,

448
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,560
 okay, so then correspondingly you will get another spectrum, but this spectrum will be a

449
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:26,760
 discrete signal spectrum, right, so going to be a DTFT result, so this is the tool we use to

450
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:37,160
 represent either CT or DT in the frequency domain, all right, okay, so, okay, I have these slides to

451
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,960
 okay, just in case, okay, because I don't know how many of you actually learned DTFT, if you already

452
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,600
 know DTFT, forget about this slide, right, there's this recap, but if you have it, you've never

453
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:51,480
 learned DTFT, so this is basically the pairs you need, all right, you need a forward transform

454
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,480
 on the top, which is going to convert the time domain to frequency domain, right, and some,

455
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,520
 we also refer this as an analysis process, you analyze the signal in the frequency domain,

456
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,920
 all right, and there are a few things you have to be careful, right, first one is this guy,

457
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,040
 the GP, the left-hand side, it's going to be a periodic function, so in other words,

458
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,840
 it's going to repeat itself in the period of 2 pi, you can try this, but mathematically you can

459
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:24,120
 tell that this is actually a periodic function, always, no matter what signals you are talking about,

460
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:31,240
 it's always a periodic function, and I believe all of you know what is this e to the power of minus j omega,

461
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:37,959
 if you use the Euler formula, you can represent it as a real power, which is a cosine, imaginary

462
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:44,279
 power, which is the sine, minus sine, okay, but it's actually the base function, it's a unit circle

463
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:51,640
 in the complex domain, right, and then you can also get it back by applying inverse DTFT to

464
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:57,879
 convert the spectrum back to the time domain, so it's going to give you back, give you recover

465
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:03,240
 signal from the frequency domain, one thing you have to be careful is that there's a 1 over 2 pi

466
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:09,480
 in front, okay, so some of you may ask me why there's 1 over 2 pi, right, it's only a scaling factor,

467
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,040
 you want to scale back to the original scale, so you have to compensate this 1 over 2 pi,

468
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:20,280
 right, because we are doing this summation, okay, especially this this integration, you have to

469
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,000
 normalize it over the range, right, but it doesn't really change the form, it only changed the scale,

470
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:34,920
 so you will get back to the GN, and the GN will be completely determined by only one period of the

471
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,080
 spectrum, you only need one period, because this guy is going to be periodically repeating, right,

472
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:47,240
 but only one period can completely determine GN, because the integration is only over one period,

473
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,520
 right, so later you will see that why we only care about the base band, because that's enough,

474
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:57,720
 you don't have to go beyond, right, it's the same, okay, this is just a recap if you do not know what

475
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:05,640
 is, you know, DTFD, okay, but you can actually imagine the difference between DTFT and CTFD

476
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:12,520
 in the following way, right, so consider this 2D plane where you have to care about analog side,

477
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:18,600
 which is on the left, you have to talk about the digital domain on the right, okay, there's always

478
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:25,240
 these two domains, so you can convert the signal in the two domain, that's the DA and AD converter,

479
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:31,720
 we talk about how you can convert the two, correspondingly there will be a tool to convert

480
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:39,319
 signal from top to the bottom, which is actually time domain to friction domain, right, so for the

481
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:47,000
 CT there's something called a CTFD, for discrete signal there's a DTFD, DTFD, right, so both of

482
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,320
 them will be the tool you need to get the frequency spectrum, but depends on what signal you're talking

483
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:59,400
 about the tool is different, and you can get back by running the inverse transform, all right, so this

484
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:07,320
 is how you can memorize it, and now what we could really care about is this guy, aliasing, okay,

485
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:14,040
 the whole reason we're talking so many these kind of things like transform, you know, DTFDs to

486
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:20,200
 finally reach the topic we need, the aliasing, right, so this is actually for you to understand

487
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:25,880
 the relationship between the functions, between the signals, how can you do inverse transform,

488
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:32,200
 forward transform, this always appears, right, but how this one end up with the aliasing formula,

489
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:37,640
 okay, so we have to look at the frequency, okay, so sorry, this is not the illustration for you to

490
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:46,600
 understand, right, so basically, right, DTFD is actually a shifted version of CTFT, right, so

491
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:52,600
 just what I'm saying that when you go from digital signal, sorry, analog signal to digital signal

492
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:58,440
 is nothing but the sampling, right, just sample at a certain time, right, so when we say sampling

493
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,960
 mathematically what are we talking about, we're talking about, okay maybe I used the mouse,

494
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:10,520
 we're talking about an analog signal multiplied by an impulse train, right, what does impulse

495
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:16,600
 train mean, so you have a lot of impulse at the period of T, right, so if you multiply together,

496
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:24,280
 only the time T or NT will be sampled, right, so sampling process can be viewed as an analog signal

497
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:30,120
 multiply where is the impulse train, right, the impulse train is actually having a period of T,

498
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:38,120
 right, this is a mathematical way of describing sampling, okay, now you can do CTFT for the analog,

499
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:46,040
 you can do DTFD for the discrete signal, right, and you end up with the same thing in the end,

500
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:52,040
 right, if you do CTFT of the CT you will have the spectrum, right, this will be your continuous

501
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:59,240
 time for your transfer result, you can also do the DTFD to get your, you know, DTFD spectrum,

502
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:06,200
 but how are these guys related, right, CTFT result, how is it related to DTFD, well some of you may

503
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:12,839
 learn that the multiplication in time domain is equivalent to a convolution in frequency domain,

504
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:19,319
 right, okay, anyone doesn't know this, anyone doesn't know, but it's very important, right, so

505
00:49:19,879 --> 00:49:25,319
 whenever we talk about frequency domain one of the important thing is you can always convert a

506
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:31,000
 multiplication into a convolution, or the other way around, if you have a convolution in time

507
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,360
 domain you can do a multiplication in the frequency domain, okay, you can prove this, but it's always

508
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:43,240
 true, so in time domain we're talking about signal multiplied by an impulse train, right,

509
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:51,000
 correspondingly in the frequency domain it's actually a CTFT spectrum convolved with the impulse train,

510
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,840
 all right, so this is how these two CTFT and DTFD related, so if I have a signal

511
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:06,040
 I'm convolving the signal with an impulse train, what am I doing here, what do I have in the end,

512
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,320
 so I have a signal, right, this for example if this is my signal, right, so I'm convolving the

513
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:23,560
 signal with a bunch of impulse function, so what will I get, what actually happens in this convolution,

514
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,120
 exactly repeat, right, because if you have one impulse function it's going to be the self, right,

515
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,400
 if you have a signal impulse function it's going to be a shifted version of the function,

516
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:39,160
 if you have impulse train what actually have is a repeated version and a shifted version,

517
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:44,440
 so you are creating duplicates, so this is my original function, I create duplicates with the

518
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:50,280
 shift of t and now the duplicates with shift of 2t, right, sorry, f, sorry, the noise is already f,

519
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:59,160
 right, fs and 2fs, so what happens is that the DTFD results of the CTFT will be nothing but the

520
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:06,920
 duplicate and shifted version, okay, so this is how you can relate CTFT to DTFD, right,

521
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:15,240
 mathematically if this is my CTFT, all right, what I have of the corresponding DTFD will be the

522
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:22,040
 shifted version, of course the shift can be multiple of k, right, k negative means shift to the left,

523
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:28,680
 k positive shifts to the right, but you will create infinitely many replicates of the base signal

524
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:36,440
 by shifting them in the integer of you know omega t here, so that's how you can get to the DTFD

525
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:51,320
 result, yes, yes sampling frequency, yeah, but it's actually, let me see, the small one, yes,

526
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,560
 but it's normalized, normalized sampling frequency, yes, so this one depends on sampling frequency,

527
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:01,960
 the higher the sampling frequency, the more shift you have, so the sampling frequency will

528
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,680
 determine how much you shift, so we'll get there very soon, right, but you're right, fs is sampling

529
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:11,880
 frequency, yes, okay, but I want you to understand you know because next slide is going to be the

530
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,680
 result, but I want you to understand where these replicas come from, it comes from the fact that

531
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:25,320
 all the DTFD will be the shifted version, and repeated version of the CTFT, right, it's coming

532
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,760
 from the fact that we're doing multiplication in the time domain, so we're going to be equivalent of

533
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:36,520
 doing convolution in the frequency domain, right, and the convolution with impulse train is nothing

534
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:44,840
 but repeat and shift, okay, I mean if you don't get it just just memorize it, okay, I wish you'd

535
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:52,760
 appreciate that, but you know the important thing is in the end, right, our DTFD result on the left

536
00:52:52,840 --> 00:53:01,240
 side will be the shifted version and duplicates of the baseband, Gn, GA, right, GP will be the

537
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:11,400
 you know duplicates of the GA, okay, all right, so now this equation two is important because this

538
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:17,080
 equation is where the AD is in come from, we call it AD is in formula, okay, because something

539
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:23,240
 sometimes is going to be wrong when we create the duplicates, all right, so let's understand why

540
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:31,160
 way it goes wrong, but before that let's define some, okay, not really, okay, fine, so this formula

541
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:36,120
 will be the fundamental or essential to understand what is Nyquist-Umpolian theory, which is basically

542
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,240
 maybe the most important theory in signal processing, right, Nyquist-Umpolian theory,

543
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:45,560
 it basically the foundation for all the modern communication signal processing system, but

544
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:52,520
 in the end it's going to be determined by this AD is in formula, okay, and the AD is in well because,

545
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:58,360
 like I mentioned earlier, it's going to be caused by insufficient sampling, in other words, this one

546
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:05,720
 omega t is too small, omega t is large, you are safe, but omega t is smaller, based on the equation

547
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:11,640
 two, you get a problem, okay, so where does this problem come from, let's look at this example,

548
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:20,600
 right, so if this is our CTFT result, spectrum of the continuous time signal, right,

549
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:29,319
 when I'm doing the sampling, I mentioned, what I will have will be the repeated version of my GA,

550
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:38,040
 okay, so this is my GA, I'm going to have my GP like this, okay, so GP is nothing but scaled

551
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:44,520
 and repeat version of my GA, all right, so this is what I mean, just not the formula,

552
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:50,120
 I'm visualized the formula in one example, using this example, right, this is the upper case is

553
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:55,880
 before sampling, this is after sampling, all right, so after sampling you will get this kind of

554
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:02,440
 replicates, right, integer multiple, in the space of integer multiple of omega t, right, one time,

555
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:10,280
 two time, or minus one time, minus two time, okay, so looks okay, right, you just create duplicates,

556
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:18,360
 right, but it may not always be okay, okay, let's define this, okay, so the one in the middle,

557
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,400
 we mean in other words, the baseband signal without any shift, we call it baseband,

558
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:30,120
 because this frequency range will be exactly between minus omega t divided by two to positive

559
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,040
 omega t divided by two, right, so this is something called the baseband portion,

560
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,839
 most likely this will be enough to describe the signal, because otherwise it will be just

561
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:44,440
 repeating, right, this periodic function, so we call this frequency range as the baseband,

562
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,960
 or we call it the nyquist band, it contains the entire information of the signal, all right,

563
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,440
 and this is one example where you call this baseband and you call the rest of like replicates,

564
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:07,240
 so it is actually clear that you, you know, when your omega t is larger than two times omega m,

565
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:13,880
 okay, so here omega m is defined as the maximum frequency in the signal, okay, what is maximum

566
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:20,040
 frequency in the signal, so consider this is your signal, right, your signal, well, if the signal

567
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:26,280
 has limited band, the maximum band, it means the maximum number of frequency that give you non-zero

568
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:32,920
 response, right, so if your signal is band limited, it's going to, there's going to have a omega m

569
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:40,840
 which is described the maximum bandwidth, okay, so if our sampling rate is large enough, in other

570
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:47,880
 words, if the sampling frequency is larger than two times maximum frequency band, we are safe,

571
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:53,720
 well okay, because our space, the spacing is actually enough, your next duplicates will be

572
00:56:54,359 --> 00:57:02,439
 far enough to deviate from your first baseband, okay, there's no overlap, okay, the problem

573
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:10,359
 happens at the time there is overlap, in other words, if my sampling rate somehow is very small,

574
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:17,560
 especially smaller than two times omega m, what you will have is not something like this,

575
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:24,600
 right, this is okay, you have enough spacing, but you may have the case that the first replica's

576
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:30,520
 overlap with your baseband signal, okay, I hope this one is on, everyone understand this, right, so

577
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:37,320
 omega m, remember omega m is the maximum bandwidth, nothing to do with sampling, just the signal,

578
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:44,279
 how wide the signal is, right, that's omega m, the omega t is the how far you shift the signal

579
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:52,520
 to create the first replica, so error happens when the shift is not enough, you don't shift enough

580
00:57:53,400 --> 00:58:00,840
 such that your baseband signal somehow overlap with your first replica, and the overlap will create

581
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:08,360
 some kind of a superposition of the overlap part, you will have the smooth part, okay, so this is

582
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:14,440
 actually the error because this part may not be recovered anymore, you cannot recover back the

583
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:20,040
 original signal, sometimes, all right, so this is something we call the aliasing artifacts,

584
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:26,280
 aliasing effects or artifacts depends on whether you think it's good or bad, this one will be

585
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:33,800
 happened if you have your omega t smaller than two times omega m, it's going to give you this

586
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:41,320
 kind of distortion, okay, the distortion happens when the two bands overlap to each other, okay,

587
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:51,720
 oops, so these will create the shift, overlap of the shifted replicates, and there's a chance that

588
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:57,560
 GA can never be recovered by the later, the D2A, right, now it's actually the digital domain,

589
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:03,480
 but it may not be recovered and that caused the problem, so this is because the distortion from

590
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:10,520
 the part of the replicas immediately outside of the baseband folded back or aliased, right,

591
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:15,160
 into the baseband, so you have some interference between the replicas and the baseband, right,

592
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:22,440
 this is where the error comes from, okay, so this is what we call aliasing, so this portion,

593
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:28,920
 right, the portion within the low pass bandwidth of the filter, so I mean, like I mentioned, right,

594
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,360
 well every time we do what is A2D, before that, you remember there's actually something called

595
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:40,440
 anti-aliasing filter, right, so what does the anti-aliasing filter do is to control the bandwidth,

596
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 you think about like a low pass filter, right, you can specify, say hey, even though my signal

597
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,840
 spread out very, very wide, but I know that my sampling rate is only in such kind of a frequency,

598
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:58,280
 right, I want to do some kind of cut before creating the replicas, and the cut here is to make sure

599
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:04,840
 that, you know, the bandwidth is actually within the recover range, right, so this is actually where

600
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:10,440
 the anti-aliasing filter comes from, so if you don't do that, right, when aliasing occurs,

601
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,000
 the original signal cannot be perfectly recovered because they mix up together, right, you want to

602
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,240
 make sure this mix up doesn't happen, so this is actually where the low pass filter come in,

603
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:24,200
 right, and of course later when you do recovery, you also need another low pass filter

604
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:29,399
 to cut the baseband, so if you don't have anti-aliasing, you will have this aliasing here,

605
01:00:29,399 --> 01:00:34,359
 and this part, even though we know that, is actually a, you know, triangle, right, but actually

606
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:39,080
 going to be a rectangle in this case, right, this is where the error comes from, so this amount of

607
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:44,919
 distortion is due to the aliasing and due to the insufficient sampling frequency, right, so here's

608
01:00:44,919 --> 01:00:51,799
 one example, actually I like this example, consider this is actually a very simple function, the cosine

609
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:56,440
 function, right, the reason we like cosine functions is because cosine function of spectrum is very

610
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,440
 simple, right, all of you should know what is spectrum of cosine function, it gives you two spikes,

611
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:07,560
 right, two impulse functions, right, one at the positive, one at the negative, all right, so if

612
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:13,800
 this is my cosine function, which is analog, right, I'm starting from a signal like this, right,

613
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:21,560
 one impulse at f0, one impulse at minus f0, right, so I'm going to show you like what happened if I

614
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:27,960
 do have sufficient sampling, right, so when I do sampling, what I'm going to do is create

615
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:33,080
 replicates in the frequency, I'm doing sampling in the time domain, but I'm creating the replicates

616
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:39,480
 in the frequency domain, right, so what I will have is if this is my baseband signal, right,

617
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:47,080
 after sampling, I'm going to introduce the first replicates, okay, and these replicates, we can

618
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:54,759
 tell that the distance between the center and the baseband 0 will be the fs, right, remember the fs,

619
01:01:54,759 --> 01:01:59,400
 the larger the sampling frequency, the further away there will be between the replicates and the

620
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:04,600
 baseband, right, so the distance between 0 to the center of the first replicates is actually fs,

621
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:12,120
 all right, and you will create another replicates to the left-hand side, right, so you can keep doing

622
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:17,560
 this, right, remember you can create infinitely many replicates from minus 0, minus infinity to positive

623
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:25,080
 infinity, all right, but when I do this, clearly I don't have enough sampling frequency, right,

624
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:34,440
 you can tell that these fs are smaller than two times of f0, right, remember the safe sampling

625
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:41,960
 frequency must be larger than two times maximum frequency, right, f0, so clearly this fs is

626
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:48,600
 smaller than f0, so this is what I'm going to have eventually, you can tell that the first

627
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:55,000
 replicates clearly overlap with my baseband signals, right, so this is actually the portion of overlap

628
01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:02,040
 here, okay, let me go back, all right, so this is my this is my baseband signal, right, the baseband

629
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:07,560
 signal has a range of the frequency, okay, the maximum frequency of my baseband signal is called f0,

630
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:13,080
 just now I called omega m, it's the same thing, right, here I called omega m, right, here I just

631
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:19,560
 called f0 is the same thing, but it's described, what's the band path, I mean what's the baseband,

632
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:24,360
 right, how wide the baseband is, so this is the first parameter you need to know, right,

633
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,880
 suppose you have a question in the exam, right, I give you a signal, the first thing you want to

634
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:33,799
 know is what's the maximum frequency, all right, and now the number is the sampling frequency,

635
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:38,760
 the sampling frequency, nothing to do with the signal, is how fast you sample the signal,

636
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:45,640
 all right, so this frequency is called fs, all right, these fs will determine the shift, how

637
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:52,600
 much you shift from the baseband to the first replicates, okay, so it's a distance between the

638
01:03:52,600 --> 01:04:01,320
 zero and the center of the first replica, how much they shift, right, so now you should tell

639
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:08,680
 the difference, what is f0, what is fs, fs only to do with the sampling, f0 only to do with the

640
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:18,120
 signal, okay, the problem happens when the fs is not enough, in other words fs is smaller than two

641
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:26,760
 times f0, now you have a problem because clearly the first replicates overlap with your baseband

642
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:33,240
 signal, okay, the dashed line here belongs to the replica, right, the solid line here belongs to

643
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:38,920
 the baseband, right, so this is my baseband, when I create my first replica, clearly this is the

644
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:46,440
 overlap, and overlap causes adhesion, causes distortion, okay, and you can keep doing this

645
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:51,560
 and you'll create a lot of distortion like this, like this, you have a lot of overlap between every

646
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:57,400
 two adjacent replicas, right, so now what happens if I somehow have to do a recovery,

647
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:06,120
 when the recovery, remember I only care about baseband, I will do a low pass filter to kill all

648
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:13,000
 the frequency range beyond baseband, in other words I only care about the information up to f0,

649
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:22,040
 okay, so to the, sorry, not f0, actually half of the, let me see, what is,

650
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:33,080
 f0, okay, f0 basically, so you only care about the things within, right, so when you do the

651
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:40,840
 filtering, right, you will only keep the things within the baseband, right, but clearly when

652
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:45,960
 you keep the baseband, these two guys, like this dashed line, this solid line, they are not part

653
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:51,560
 of the baseband, they are coming from the replicas, so this is the adhesion, right, these cause the

654
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:57,320
 error because that's not true, that's not the original signal, so all of these unwanted components

655
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:04,280
 are adhesion, okay, you can try, you try by yourself, if you, for example, if you shift your signal

656
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:09,800
 far away, you won't have this overlap, so having sufficient large FS is the solver,

657
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:15,320
 to overcome adhesion, right, so this is where, I mean, where the problem comes from and how

658
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:22,920
 you can solve the problem, so I hope this example tells you, like, you know, where the spectrum

659
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:29,560
 happens, like how you can actually have this adhesion when you have your FS that's not enough,

660
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:35,160
 right, smaller than 2f0, and the reconstruction is always based on fundamental frequency range,

661
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:40,600
 which is a certain range, out of the frequency, oh, okay, so this is going to tell you that you

662
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:45,000
 can't get rid of it by having a shorter range, right, but it's going to still give you some

663
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,319
 adhesions, even if you apply the shorter range within the low pass filter, right, but basically

664
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:55,879
 the adhesion coming from the overlap, so these actually lay the foundation of the sampling

665
01:06:55,879 --> 01:07:02,200
 theory because sampling theory tells you that when you sample the signal in order to prevent

666
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:08,040
 adhesion, your sampling frequency must have some minimum value, right, and this minimum value will

667
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:14,439
 be, we call it Nyquist condition, okay, if you want to get rid of adhesion at all, you have to

668
01:07:14,439 --> 01:07:19,319
 satisfy the Nyquist condition, in other words, you have to make sure your sampling frequency is

669
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:25,399
 larger than 2 times the bandwidth, right, 2 times omega m, if you satisfy the condition, you are

670
01:07:25,399 --> 01:07:30,839
 safe, you don't get this adhesion, right, okay, so this is actually where the Nyquist condition

671
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:37,560
 comes from, right, we explain this and this is going to prevent adhesion, all right, and now,

672
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:46,280
 of course, if this is my sampling rate, right, I can divide it by two to kind of tell you that,

673
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:50,760
 okay, this is actually the folding frequency, so within folding frequency, every information is

674
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:57,000
 safe, but beyond folding frequency, you will have a risk of getting the adhesion, right, so

675
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:03,720
 the first Nyquist condition tells you how to design a sampling, how to set the sampling rate

676
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:10,120
 sufficiently large, right, a folding frequency tells you from the signal perspective, why pass a

677
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:15,640
 signal to a sampler, what is the safe range, right, the safe range will be half of the

678
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:19,640
 Nyquist, half of the sampling rate, which is called a folding frequency, beyond that you will have

679
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:26,600
 overlap, you will have adhesion, right, so this kind of highest frequency of the signal

680
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:33,800
 contained in the baseband is usually called Nyquist frequency, right, and this one determining

681
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:39,720
 what's the minimum required sampling frequency, you could do two times it, and this must be used

682
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:45,800
 to fully recover, if you want to fully recover the signal, you must satisfy the Nyquist frequency,

683
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:52,840
 two times it, right, this is the minimum required, okay, so basically this is, you know,

684
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,960
 the most important things in the sampling theory, right, but we went through all of this for you

685
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:03,080
 to understand where this comes from, it comes from the fact that we do not want overlap, we do not

686
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:16,040
 want adhesion, all right, any question, is it still okay, okay, good, yeah, so then you know,

687
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:20,920
 two times O M, right, this is called Nyquist rate, so Nyquist rate is going to define the

688
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,760
 Nyquist condition, right, every time we say Nyquist rate, you have to remind yourself,

689
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:31,640
 Nyquist is equal to two times the maximum bandwidth, right, omega M, so here's one example, right,

690
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:37,560
 after example we can take a break, okay, here's one example, right, consider you have analog

691
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:41,640
 signal, which is like cosine signal, the reason why like cosine is simple, right, cosine only

692
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:46,200
 gives you two spikes, so it's very simple, but every time, right, if I give you a signal,

693
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:51,320
 for example, if this is my signal, what information you need to read from the signal,

694
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:59,640
 okay, suppose this is exam, right, I give you say, hey, my signal is equal to five times cosine

695
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:05,080
 two pi times one thousand T, right, what is the information come to mind if you see this signal,

696
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:13,800
 or what you need to get, extract from the signal, sorry, frequency, yeah, what frequency?

697
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,720
 Yeah, exactly, right, so we actually went through this, so you're right,

698
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:30,040
 basically what we care about is this omega M, okay, because all of these things, you can tell

699
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:36,280
 that how to determine sampling rate, the only thing matters is the omega M, okay, in other words,

700
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:42,840
 why give you a signal in exam, right, I can make it like sine, cosine, whatever I like, but the most

701
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:49,160
 important thing matter is what is omega M, you have to have this information, okay, amplitude

702
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:55,639
 issue doesn't matter, the omega M matters, this is a starting point, right, so in this example,

703
01:10:55,639 --> 01:10:59,880
 right, if I give you the signal like this, can you tell me what is the omega M,

704
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,280
 or how can I know the omega M in this case,

705
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:16,040
 so does the five matters, no, because five is scales, right, you know, if it doesn't have five

706
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:21,880
 amplitudes, one, five is amplitude, the number in front of cosine doesn't change the frequency,

707
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:27,480
 right, so this number doesn't matter, okay, what matter is this guy, all right, what matter is

708
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:34,600
 this guy, so you should look at what is the coefficient before t, okay, so this one thousand

709
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:40,120
 actually is the f, is the frequency, all right, remember, oh, the standard definition of cosine

710
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:46,360
 is cosine 2 pi f times t, right, you can represent omega, you can represent f, but if it's f,

711
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:52,519
 the fs equal, sorry, f0 equal to 1000, or omega M, right, depends on how you name it, so these

712
01:11:52,519 --> 01:11:57,240
 matters, you have to tell yourself like, okay, this is a band and limited function,

713
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:02,760
 where is omega M equal to 1000, okay, that's it, another thing you do, you don't need,

714
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:08,599
 forget about five, it doesn't matter, only 1000 important, okay, extract that immediately if I

715
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:15,480
 give you a signal, all right, okay, now the second thing you need to know is the sampling rate,

716
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:22,360
 right, all of these micro things is about omega M, omega t, right, now we have omega M, now omega

717
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:28,600
 t, what is omega t, 8000, that's it, you just need these two numbers, add other things, forget

718
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:33,960
 about it, right, doesn't matter, five, cosine, sine, doesn't matter, you have these two, you can play

719
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:39,160
 all the trick of your Nyquist, right, okay, so now the question says first, sketch my spectrum,

720
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:44,200
 all right, sketch spectrum, it's very simple, right, cosine is just two spikes, but where the

721
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:53,080
 spike matters, right, the spike will be located exactly at 1000, right, remember the maximum

722
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:59,000
 frequency is actually omega M, and this omega M equal to 1000, so the two spikes will be exactly

723
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:06,600
 located at 1000 hertz and minus 1000 hertz, of course the height will be determined by the

724
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:12,040
 coefficient, right, so if it's five, it's going to be half of five, right, so this will be the,

725
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,960
 I mean you can also do the Euler formula to decompose cosine into a, you know,

726
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,320
 what is that, the real plus imaginary part here, okay, but important thing is the second question,

727
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:32,360
 right, so they want you to sketch the spectrum of the sample signal, so this is unsampled signal,

728
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:36,040
 right, I haven't considered a thousand at all, right, it's just original signal,

729
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:41,960
 once I sampled it, right, when you heard the term samples, the thing come to mind is two things,

730
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:47,160
 what happened in the time domain, what happened in the frequency domain, okay, for this subject you

731
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:52,200
 have to think about two, right, time domain, frequency domain, time domain is nothing but

732
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:58,440
 just discretize it, right, they only sample at time of t, 2t, 3t, most important thing is frequency

733
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:05,960
 domain, we just learned that sampling time domain is equal to, you know, shift and repeat in the

734
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:11,480
 frequency domain, right, in other words, I'm going to start with my original baseband signal,

735
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:19,080
 I have to create multiple replica of this guy, if I sample it, right, if I start to sample it,

736
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:25,400
 I'm going to equivalently modify my frequency spectrum by repeat the same signal with certain

737
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:32,680
 shift and this shift will be determined by the sampling rate, right, and as the shift is exactly

738
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:41,160
 equal to a thousand, right, so you can actually refer back to this example, right, this is where

739
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:48,920
 the shift come from, this shift is exactly equal to FS, all right, so here this shift is equal

740
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:55,240
 to a thousand because a thousand is my sampling rate, all right, and you can do many, right,

741
01:14:55,240 --> 01:15:01,880
 but the signal, but the question says only, okay, I only care about the spectrum from 0 to 20k,

742
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:07,480
 okay, so I only care about 0 to 20k, so I don't have to create infinity many, I just create,

743
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:16,280
 you know, baseband first replica, I already reached 17, so that's all, right, but you have to make

744
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:24,599
 sure you know the shift, the shift equal to the sampling rate, right, okay, and of course,

745
01:15:24,599 --> 01:15:28,920
 another thing don't forget is actually the scale, right, when you create the shift, you have to

746
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:37,320
 also scale the signal by divided by t, okay, so t is actually your sampling period, which is one

747
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:44,200
 over sampling frequency, okay, so two things, repeat and scale, right, the scale is just divided by t,

748
01:15:44,679 --> 01:15:51,559
 okay, I mean this is also easy to understand, right, so if you want to, if you like to shift this

749
01:15:51,559 --> 01:15:56,760
 to the very sparse way, like you shift a lot, means the f is very large, your t will be very

750
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:03,320
 small, right, so entire energy will be the same, you create a sparser, I mean fewer spikes, every

751
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:09,639
 spike will have more energy, right, so it makes sense, right, I mean if you create a very dense shift,

752
01:16:09,639 --> 01:16:13,559
 in other words your f is very small, your t will be very large, so mpt will be smaller,

753
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:20,120
 correspondingly, right, so basically the sampling doesn't, you know, violate the conservation of

754
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:27,720
 the energy, right, okay, but you do two things, scale and shift, right, both of them depends on the

755
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:38,680
 fs, right, okay, so another example as well, I can also change the baseband, right, into this form,

756
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:45,160
 but same thing, right, even if I change my signal, you have to extract information from it, right,

757
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:51,080
 like I mentioned, the important thing is what's omega m, right, but clearly these have two terms,

758
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:58,040
 the first term omega m is 2,000, the second term is 5,000, so you will have signal with

759
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:05,560
 summation of the two, right, but the omega m will be determined by the larger one, right, because the

760
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:12,840
 larger one will dominate my spectrum, right, so there will be one signal, one cosine within

761
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:19,880
 2,000, there will be another cosine within 5,000, right, but the 5,000 defined the entire omega m,

762
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:25,640
 and you can also do the, I mean, the replicates, right, for example, this is my baseband, right,

763
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:31,720
 this is my 2,000 version, and this is my 5,000 version, so I create the first shift to here,

764
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:38,680
 remember this is my 8,000, I will have my first replicates of the, this 2,000 version and the

765
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:47,000
 5,000 version, okay, so you can try this yourself, but you will have aliasing because this 8,000,

766
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,840
 some point in rate, is smaller than 2 times 5,000, right, because remember this entire

767
01:17:53,720 --> 01:18:01,400
 big omega m is dominated by 5,000, so the Nyquist rate will be 2 times 5,000, which is 10,000,

768
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:07,719
 right, clearly 8,000 is not enough, so you will have replicates, you will have aliasing due to the

769
01:18:07,719 --> 01:18:13,480
 violation of the Nyquist sampling rate, all right, but you can actually figure out where this aliasing

770
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:20,040
 come from, all right, so I encourage you to try this yourself, okay, just try it, and if you

771
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:25,480
 figure out anything weird, you can come to me, I can explain for you, but always it's good to learn

772
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:30,679
 by doing things, right, not just listening to me, right, listening is not effective, trying

773
01:18:30,679 --> 01:18:35,320
 yourself is actually more effective, all right, the second question is very, it's the same, right,

774
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:42,599
 I want to recover the analog signal, right, how can I do it, well you can apply a low pass filter,

775
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:50,280
 so they want you to apply a low pass filter with color frequency 4k hertz, right, in other words,

776
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:56,360
 even though I have this GP, but I don't care about all of them, I only care about the frequency

777
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:03,080
 within 4k hertz, so I will remove all of the frequency components beyond 4k, right, this is

778
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:09,160
 actually the result after low pass filtering, so I will have this guy survive, but clearly all of

779
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:13,880
 these are aliasing, right, all of these are not the fundamental signal, these are aliasing, so this

780
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:19,080
 is what I have, so if I recover my original signal, I cannot basically, right, I will get something

781
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:24,760
 wrong, okay, so you can tell this is different from the original, right, so this is how the aliasing

782
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:34,519
 can give you the wrong recovery, wrong reconstruction, okay, all right, so you know, a quick summary,

783
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:41,080
 okay maybe one more slide, right, so it depends on what your sampling frequency is, we're talking

784
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:46,120
 about three kind of sampling, either you over sample it, in other words, your sampling frequency is

785
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:52,360
 very large, more than needed, right, more than Nyquist rate, or you can be under sample, in other

786
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:56,599
 words, your sampling frequency is like 2 small, right, aliasing, over sample too large, under

787
01:19:56,599 --> 01:20:02,840
 sample too small, critical sample is that your sampling frequency is exactly equal to Nyquist rate,

788
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:08,920
 okay, so this is critical, over sample, under sample, but in practice, normally people do

789
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,800
 over sample, right, no, very few people will do exactly critical sample, this is due to the fact

790
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:18,600
 of noise, right, normally the signal is not ideal, you may have noise, or your future may not be

791
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,560
 ideal, they may have some kind of a transition band, right, to prevent those things, people leave

792
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:29,320
 some space, people do over sampling, for example, if you are talking about telephone, right, telephone

793
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:37,080
 system, even though my acoustic signal is actually within 3.4 kilohertz, in other words, this is my

794
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:42,920
 omega n, the sampling rate is actually 8, right, you can tell this is more than double, right, so

795
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:48,120
 they leave some space, so they can actually go over sampling, same for your CD, right, maybe nowadays

796
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:53,720
 you don't really play CD, I'm the old guy, so we play CD when I was a child, so CD actually also,

797
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:58,200
 right, you can tell like 44 kilohertz is more than double of the 20k, right,

798
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,600
 yeah, so basically the sampling frequency is also sometimes affected, the system design, so

799
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:10,760
 just give you some example, but take away, right, until now you should be able to understand where

800
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:17,720
 the ad is in come from, right, you should understand what does ad as in mean, and also without

801
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:22,200
 understanding ad as in, right, if you have still have some doubts, you better ask me because

802
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,480
 without knowing this, you will have some difficulty understanding the following content,

803
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:31,000
 so ad is important, some point is important, okay, and also you can read the textbook at the

804
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:37,400
 section 6.1, where they have more comprehensive explanation if you want, but the main points

805
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:43,960
 for up to now is that we have to appreciate the ad is in formula, where the replica is generated,

806
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:49,320
 right, and what's the condition for perfect recovery, right, over sampling, critical

807
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:54,519
 sampling, and what is the condition for the sampling rate, and what are the ad is in formula,

808
01:21:54,519 --> 01:21:59,000
 for phenomenon, for you know, radio images, these are something practical, right, but these are

809
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:07,080
 something for now, until now, okay, any question, will I take a break, let's say maybe 15 minutes,

810
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:11,639
 all right, you can ask me a question in between if you want, all right, but let's take a break,

811
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:17,320
 we come back at 8.15, all right, okay, great, so let's take a break,

812
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:26,839
 yes, oh, okay, so I have a question, yes,

813
01:22:26,839 --> 01:22:34,120
 Is this multiracial sampling ratio, like, is it changing?

814
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:39,240
 Yes, yes, so, you know, right now we have this FS, right, and normally we have one FS for the

815
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:44,280
 system, so if you only have one FS in the system, it means monorail, but in some system you may

816
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:48,920
 have multiple sampling in different branch, and they are going to learn that there's a reason

817
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:57,880
 of doing that, it may change, it also may change in the single branch, right, so like I mentioned,

818
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,880
 one of the examples is the wavelets, right, when the wavelet transform, you sometimes look at the

819
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:06,040
 low-low pass, but you realize that low-low pass actually is actually down-sampled, right, the

820
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,800
 reason of doing that is you want to make sure there's a perfect reconstruction by merging

821
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,200
 the low-low and the low-high, high-low and high-high, right.

822
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:19,080
 So is it only happening in the AG conversion, or it can also happen at the digital side?

823
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:24,360
 It can happen at the digital side, so for example, if I give you a fast sample digital signal,

824
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:28,120
 I can further down-sample it, right, this is also like a rate change.

825
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:33,320
 So it's a little bit like when we processed the image.

826
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:38,040
 Yes, yes, yes, you have a image, say 500 by 500, you can make it 250 by 250, right,

827
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,160
 this is like a lower the rate.

828
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:46,200
 Digital, yeah, two-dimensional, one-dimensional also, but basically rate change means you do

829
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,960
 down sampling, you do up sampling.

830
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:55,720
 All kinds of, yeah, all of these are fundamental, yeah, all kind of signals, yeah, okay, good,

831
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,160
 but we'll get there, don't worry.

832
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:00,120
 Can I see the first page of the exercise?

833
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:02,600
 This one?

834
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,840
 Yeah, I don't understand why the employee two days, 2.5.

835
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,960
 Oh, because it's half, it's half, you are formula.

836
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:18,040
 So you have this cosine, right, you can decompose cosine into two, how should I say,

837
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:18,680
 spike function.

838
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:28,920
 So the question, don't want me to draw the picture of five cosine two by 10-smash-

839
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,400
 Oh, what do you mean, draw the picture?

840
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,600
 Draw the picture?

841
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:37,160
 Draw the picture, why the amplitude is not five because-

842
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:41,400
 Oh, this is time domain, we're talking about frequency domain, so you cannot draw the cosine,

843
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,520
 but this is the frequency spectrum of the cosine function.

844
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,400
 Oh, okay, I know.

845
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:50,679
 Right, the reason, how to get it, you have to do your formula to decompose the cosine into two,

846
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:56,759
 you know, complex number, because each of the complex number will be just a spike in the spectrum.

847
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,920
 Right, okay, good.

848
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:03,080
 Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

849
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:19,879
 Oh, you said this is finite, right?

850
01:25:19,879 --> 01:25:23,879
 Yes, this is finite number.

851
01:25:23,879 --> 01:25:26,599
 So it's just that it's a finite number.

852
01:25:26,599 --> 01:25:27,240
 Oh, right.

853
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:49,000
 Ok, you are in question.

854
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:10,200
 Depends.

855
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:14,280
 So nivel it can generate a linear layer.

856
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,320
 But in practice, it is vilified.

857
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,320
 The result of the fact is...

858
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:18,320
 Yeah.

859
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,320
 You said it's in the math.

860
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,320
 Yes.

861
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,320
 How to make a linear series of equations?

862
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:26,320
 You just need to make a Zinc function.

863
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:33,320
 You want to limit the left.

864
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,320
 Left is just a rectangular function.

865
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,320
 You just need to make a rectangular function

866
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,320
 and you need to come up with a sinc.

867
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,320
 The frequency of the function is sinc.

868
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,320
 It's the same.

869
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,320
 I didn't hear your question.

870
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:51,320
 If I have a particular place,

871
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,320
 it's called the finite number of signals.

872
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,320
 It's called the number of signals.

873
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,320
 If I have a particular place,

874
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,320
 it's called the number of signals.

875
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,320
 By English.

876
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:09,320
 The first step is to find the eigen-linear.

877
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:15,320
 It should be the linear series of signals.

878
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:19,320
 If you do this, it should be the finite number of signals.

879
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:20,320
 I'm telling you.

880
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,320
 In the math, it's the infinite number of signals.

881
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,320
 The point of this is that

882
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,320
 in practice, the number of signals

883
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,320
 is just the finite number of signals.

884
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,320
 So, in practice, it's just the number of signals

885
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,320
 that we've actually agreed to.

886
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,320
 Yes.

887
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,320
 I want to ask you about this.

888
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,320
 If we have a given value,

889
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:49,320
 the number of signals is just the finite number of signals.

890
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,320
 No.

891
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,320
 Your point is in the current.

892
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,320
 But why do we have to put this in the current

893
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,320
 because we want to get the value of the current

894
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,320
 and we don't want to get the value of this current?

895
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,320
 Yes.

896
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:04,320
 So, it's actually in the system,

897
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,320
 you have to consider the weight,

898
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,320
 and the storage.

899
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,320
 Because it's discretized.

900
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,320
 So, this is also just a practical question.

901
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,320
 Yes.

902
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,320
 So, the next step is to consider the weight.

903
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:18,320
 Yes.

904
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,320
 I'm not going to talk about the quantization.

905
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,320
 What else?

906
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,320
 I have a question.

907
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,320
 I have a question.

908
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,320
 Now, grab a little bit of the answer.

909
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:31,320
 Okay, go ahead.

910
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:34,320
 My question is, how does this DGA come about?

911
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,320
 Oh, interpolation.

912
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,320
 So, later, we're going to learn that later.

913
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,320
 Not this class, but later.

914
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,320
 You can interpolate to come back

915
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,320
 from the discrete signal to an analog signal.

916
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,320
 After the process.

917
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,320
 So, basically, there's a way to convert

918
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,320
 a discrete signal to an analog signal

919
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,320
 by so-called interpolation.

920
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,320
 It's a...

921
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,320
 It's a difference.

922
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,320
 A difference?

923
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,320
 Yes, interplay.

924
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,320
 Yes.

925
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,320
 No, it's not a signal.

926
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,320
 It's a signal that's after the third layer.

927
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,320
 The first layer is not analog.

928
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,320
 The second layer is not analog.

929
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,320
 So, when we convert these two signals,

930
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:24,320
 we only need to convert it to an analog signal.

931
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,320
 Why not?

932
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,320
 So, you can see here,

933
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,320
 this is the first signal,

934
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:33,320
 the second signal, this is the harmonization.

935
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,320
 But, this time, it seems to be not

936
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,320
 the analog signal.

937
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,320
 We have to convert it to an analog signal.

938
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,320
 This is...

939
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,320
 You just converted it.

940
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,320
 You mean two signals,

941
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:47,320
 and this is not...

942
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:49,320
 So, you can see here,

943
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:53,320
 this is the first part of the three-core.

944
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:56,320
 And these two are the two-core.

945
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:59,320
 Yes, this is the second layer.

946
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,320
 The second layer.

947
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,320
 This is 5,000 and 2,000.

948
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,320
 You have to count it.

949
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,320
 5,000 and 2,000 are basically.

950
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:08,320
 You said that the third layer is an alias.

951
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,320
 Yes, the third layer.

952
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,320
 Yes, you have to...

953
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,320
 You have to read it.

954
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,320
 I just said, where the spikes are

955
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,320
 depends on the frequency.

956
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,320
 The frequency is 2,000 and 1,000.

957
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:19,320
 The spikes are only 2,000 and 2,000.

958
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,320
 The spikes are basically.

959
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,320
 The three-core is 5,000 and 2,000.

960
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,320
 That's...

961
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,320
 OK.

962
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,320
 No, no, no, no.

963
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:31,320
 8,000 and 5,000.

964
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,320
 This is not our signal.

965
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,320
 The other side is not the bandage.

966
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,320
 The replica.

967
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,320
 I don't know.

968
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,320
 The bandage is the signal.

969
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,320
 Is this because

970
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,320
 I want to see the difference between the two?

971
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,320
 Don't be afraid.

972
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:47,320
 I think we still have to go back to...

973
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:48,320
 Because I can't answer.

974
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,320
 I can answer, you can choose the bandage.

975
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,320
 I don't know what you're going to say.

976
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,320
 I think I still have to...

977
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,320
 You can ask me.

978
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:54,320
 I don't have any.

979
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,320
 But if you ask me, I'll ask the bandage.

980
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:56,320
 Sorry.

981
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,320
 Is it because of the production?

982
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,320
 Is it because of the production?

983
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:04,320
 Oh, yes.

984
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,320
 You can think of the sample as

985
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,320
 a multiplication of the signal.

986
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,320
 Yes, so we...

987
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,320
 So we are...

988
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:16,320
 So your sample is going to be a multiplication of the signal?

989
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,320
 So your sample is...

990
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,320
 I think...

991
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,320
 I think you should first think about

992
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,320
 your own problem.

993
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,320
 You have to be clear.

994
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,320
 First, I just said

995
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,320
 the sample process can be expressed

996
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,320
 in mathematics.

997
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,320
 But the continuous signal

998
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,320
 and an impulse train

999
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,320
 are not an impulse,

1000
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,320
 it's a state impulse.

1001
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,320
 It's a method.

1002
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,320
 Yes, but I want to ask you

1003
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,320
 why it's a multiplication.

1004
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,320
 Because the sample,

1005
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,320
 the sample is not just a sample.

1006
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,320
 It's a state impulse.

1007
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,320
 You have to figure out the difference

1008
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,320
 between the two.

1009
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,320
 So your...

1010
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:46,320
 The signal of your process

1011
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,320
 is a state impulse train

1012
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,320
 called an impulse train.

1013
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,320
 Yes.

1014
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,320
 So it's not an impulse,

1015
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,320
 it's a non-erって

1016
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,320
 It's a non-erkte.

1017
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,320
 And every step is a state impulse.

1018
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:58,320
 No steps.

1019
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,320
 You just said an impulse function.

1020
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,320
 Well, if...

1021
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,320
 Because...

1022
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,320
 Because if you step on a function,

1023
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,320
 if you make a mistake,

1024
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,320
 it means...

1025
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,320
 Because of this,

1026
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,320
 so it will be a lot more...

1027
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,320
 I just said

1028
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:13,320
 the method of the actual response

1029
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:14,320
 if you do a Fourier transform,

1030
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,320
 you will get a frequency

1031
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:16,320
 of a combination.

1032
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,320
 Yes, yes, yes.

1033
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,320
 So the Fourier transform of the impulse train

1034
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,320
 is also an impulse.

1035
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,320
 The impulse function of the Fourier transform

1036
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,320
 will not change the wave shape.

1037
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,320
 It's still an impulse.

1038
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,320
 So you say

1039
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,320
 the method of the actual impulse train

1040
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,320
 is equal to the function

1041
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,320
 of an impulse train in the frequency of a frequency.

1042
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:32,320
 Yes.

1043
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,320
 So the impulse train of a signal

1044
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,320
 is equal to

1045
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,320
 a shift of a state-of-the-art.

1046
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:38,320
 Yes, yes.

1047
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,320
 So you have the shift.

1048
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,320
 Oh, that's good.

1049
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,320
 You just said that the method of the actual response

1050
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,320
 is equal to the...

1051
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,320
 The new shifting.

1052
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,320
 You said

1053
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,320
 even using how we conform with impulse function

1054
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,320
 with time, with shift,

1055
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,320
 for example,

1056
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,320
 my impulse function is like a delta

1057
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,320
 at the heat of f minus fs.

1058
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,320
 What I'm doing is

1059
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,320
 I'm shifting my frequency

1060
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:01,320
 minus spectrum to fs.

1061
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,320
 Then you have a series of impulse.

1062
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,320
 So you are

1063
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,320
 you're saying fs, 2fs, 3fs,

1064
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,320
 the shifting of the transmission,

1065
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:10,320
 a series of replicants.

1066
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,320
 The actual operation

1067
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,320
 and the frequency of the operation

1068
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,320
 are the same.

1069
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,320
 Which two are the same?

1070
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,320
 The actual response.

1071
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,320
 The actual response

1072
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:21,320
 of the frequency of the operation

1073
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,320
 is equal to the function of the frequency.

1074
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,320
 The function of the frequency

1075
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:24,320
 is the shift of the signal.

1076
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,320
 Yes.

1077
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:26,320
 Oh, impulse train.

1078
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,320
 Impulse train.

1079
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:28,320
 Yes, impulse train.

1080
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,320
 Yes, yes.

1081
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,320
 Thank you.

1082
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,320
 Okay.

1083
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:32,320
 So you have the shift.

1084
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,320
 What?

1085
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:34,320
 No, I don't have shift.

1086
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,320
 Oh, no.

1087
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,320
 No, you can't.

1088
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,320
 You can't.

1089
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,320
 No, you can't.

1090
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,320
 You can't.

1091
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,320
 No, you can't.

1092
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,320
 I think you can't.

1093
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,320
 You can't.

1094
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,320
 You can't.

1095
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,320
 You can't record.

1096
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:46,320
 I have to.

1097
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,320
 But you have to be in the test.

1098
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:48,320
 Of course, you have to.

1099
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,320
 No, you can't.

1100
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,320
 Okay.

1101
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:52,320
 I'm sorry.

1102
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:53,320
 This is...

1103
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,320
 This is a...

1104
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,320
 This is a...

1105
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:57,320
 Wait, wait, wait.

1106
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,320
 Before...

1107
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,320
 I say no,

1108
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:00,320
 this is a...

1109
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,320
 You should be here.

1110
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,200
 You should come.

1111
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:03,700
 You should come.

1112
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:06,460
 One of the things that you do absolutely well, that's fine.

1113
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:09,219
 But you have to make sure you keep the problem.

1114
01:34:09,219 --> 01:34:10,219
 Keep up the problem.

1115
01:34:10,219 --> 01:34:10,719
 OK?

1116
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,219
 E, T, M, G, F, N, J, H.

1117
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:21,220
 I'm not going to go.

1118
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:22,220
 I'm going to go.

1119
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:23,220

 I'm going to go.

1133
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:37,220
 I'm going to go.

 I'm going to go.

1140
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,220
 I'm going to go.

 I'm going to get my!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1145
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:58,220
 Oh, good, good!

1146
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,220
 Literally scan?

1147
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:01,220
 Good good.

1148
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:02,220
 We can have a look.

1149
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:03,220
 We can have a look.

1150
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:04,220
 What?

1151
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:05,220
 Look.

1152
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:06,220
 Look.

1153
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:07,220
 Oh, south of you?

1154
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:08,220
 Going to think about Mongolia?

1155
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:38,220
 Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

1160

 yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

1161
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:38,220
 yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

1162
01:38:38,220 --> 01:39:00,080
 alright okay I think we can resume okay just now I got some questions in the in the

1163
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:03,580
 break I think some of them I wish to share with you because you may have the

1164
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:05,660
 the same questions, or even though you didn't ask.

1165
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:08,580
 So there are, I think, two students ask me

1166
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:11,400
 about this exercise, right?

1167
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:14,940
 I realize there's maybe a misunderstanding, all right?

1168
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:17,100
 So all of you know that, you know,

1169
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:18,780
 we just now show two examples, right?

1170
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:21,420
 The first example, this is a safe case

1171
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:24,380
 because we do have enough sampling rate,

1172
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:26,380
 and this case, there's no adiasing, right?

1173
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:27,660
 All of you know this.

1174
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:32,420
 The second example is the case where we do have adiasing,

1175
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:35,420
 and I will really explain to you that the reason is,

1176
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:37,620
 if you look at this signal, right,

1177
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:42,620
 the omega m should be determined by the 5,000.

1178
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:44,060
 All right, so we have two components.

1179
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,700
 This is 2,000, this is 5,000.

1180
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:50,940
 So the whole, the overall signals, right,

1181
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:54,540
 the omega m, the maximum frequency will be determined

1182
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:56,060
 by whichever is larger, right?

1183
01:39:56,060 --> 01:40:00,260
 So the 5,000 will be the omega m for the entire signal, right?

1184
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:02,020
 And based on Nyquist condition,

1185
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:03,580
 you need to have a sampling rate

1186
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:08,580
 that is at least two times 5,000 to be safe, right?

1187
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:12,460
 Clearly this 8,000 is not enough, right?

1188
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:14,220
 Okay, I hope all of you know this,

1189
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:15,900
 but I think there was some misunderstanding

1190
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:18,980
 about the plots because there's some students ask me,

1191
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:20,900
 hey, I cannot see any adiasing here.

1192
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:23,620
 So it seems like you still have the signal, right?

1193
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:26,220
 The two components survive.

1194
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,800
 Even if you say that there's adiasing, right?

1195
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,300
 But you have to be very careful

1196
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,980
 about the spikes, okay?

1197
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:35,780
 So which is the baseband spikes?

1198
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:41,380
 I mean, this is actually the spectrum after sampling.

1199
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:44,140
 It's a mixture of the baseband and also the replicants.

1200
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:47,720
 But can you tell me which of the spikes

1201
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:49,240
 are coming from the baseband?

1202
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:54,860
 Exactly, 2,000 and 5,000, right?

1203
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:57,580
 Because you have to check what is the frequency components

1204
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:58,860
 of the two cosine.

1205
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:01,540
 So with so many spikes,

1206
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:05,339
 the baseband components will be only this one,

1207
01:41:05,339 --> 01:41:08,019
 right, this one clearly is at 2,000, right?

1208
01:41:08,019 --> 01:41:11,559
 And these spikes coming from the first cosine.

1209
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:15,620
 All right, this guy, the small one here,

1210
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:16,820
 this is not baseband.

1211
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:21,660
 You don't have a cosine with 3,000 components, right?

1212
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:25,780
 So clearly the second cosine should contribute to

1213
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,380
 the spikes at 5,000.

1214
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:31,780
 So the baseband signals are actually the spike at 2,000

1215
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:35,620
 and the spike at 5,000, all right?

1216
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:40,620
 So 2,000 and 5,000, these two are the baseband signals.

1217
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:42,980
 The little guy here, the 3,000,

1218
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:46,420
 this one is actually the adiasing, it's not the baseband.

1219
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:48,220
 And this is what I exactly mean, the adiasing,

1220
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:52,340
 because these three is coming from the first replica,

1221
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:57,260
 all right, because I have my eight minus 5,000,

1222
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:58,940
 give me 3,000.

1223
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:02,440
 So this is actually adiasing.

1224
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:04,340
 That's why if you do a reconstruction,

1225
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:07,340
 you will keep the adiasing without keeping

1226
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:09,820
 the original baseband signal 5,000.

1227
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:11,620
 And this is exactly where the error are.

1228
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:14,340
 So this one do have error due to the fact

1229
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:16,580
 that it violated the Nyquist condition.

1230
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:17,900
 So don't misunderstand, I mean,

1231
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:19,220
 even though you still have two spikes,

1232
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:22,580
 but these two spikes are not the original spikes.

1233
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:26,460
 You can easily tell from the location of the spikes, right?

1234
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:27,820
 So this is actually where the,

1235
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:29,980
 I don't know, I mean, there are some students ask me,

1236
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:32,700
 so I think there could be a common misunderstanding here.

1237
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:35,140
 And another question is, I realize some of you

1238
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:37,700
 may not even know Euler formula, right?

1239
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:40,580
 So Euler formula is the one you can use

1240
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:44,380
 to decompose a synosoids, right?

1241
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:46,420
 So a cosine function can be represented

1242
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:48,600
 as two complex number.

1243
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:51,340
 Why? Because every complex number, for example,

1244
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:55,580
 E2 part of J theta equal to, you know,

1245
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:59,860
 cosine theta real and then sine theta,

1246
01:42:59,860 --> 01:43:01,620
 which is imaginary, right?

1247
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:02,900
 And because there's a minus sign,

1248
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:07,420
 the two imaginary cancel, I will end up with 2.5

1249
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:09,740
 of the spikes at the minus one,

1250
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:12,340
 sorry, minus 1,000 and the 2.5,

1251
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:13,900
 the spike at the positive 1,000.

1252
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,740
 So you can always use the Euler identity

1253
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:20,500
 to decompose a cosine and a sine, right?

1254
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:22,580
 So I will prepare something for you next week

1255
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:24,980
 because I realize maybe not everybody know it.

1256
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:27,380
 So next week, before starting,

1257
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:31,139
 I will give you some recap on this, all right?

1258
01:43:31,139 --> 01:43:34,540
 But just bear in mind that if you have a cosine function,

1259
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:37,139
 you will have two spikes, okay?

1260
01:43:37,139 --> 01:43:38,179
 Both of them are positive.

1261
01:43:38,179 --> 01:43:39,820
 If you have a sine function,

1262
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:41,340
 one of them is an active, right?

1263
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:44,300
 This is the only difference, okay?

1264
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:45,500
 All right.

1265
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:49,060
 So this is where we end it just now.

1266
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:50,580
 Oh, sorry, this is where we end it just now, right?

1267
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:51,740
 So summary of what we talk about.

1268
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:52,980
 So mainly in the ADSY, right?

1269
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:54,860
 And sampling theory, that's what we cover

1270
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:55,940
 for the first half.

1271
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:58,940
 So now, right, we talk about sampling

1272
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:02,660
 and now we can formally move to the representation

1273
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:04,740
 of the signal, transforms.

1274
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:08,100
 We already talk a little bit on the CTFT and DTFT.

1275
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:10,580
 So let's learn that more systematically, right?

1276
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:13,100
 So it's all coming from this guy, right?

1277
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:15,700
 Fluorier, so you know, fluoride transform, right?

1278
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:18,780
 Fluoride transform is coming from a name after this guy.

1279
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:21,140
 And because he's the first one,

1280
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:24,940
 discover that basically you can represent any signal

1281
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:28,540
 using a bunch of basic components, right?

1282
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:30,260
 So in other words, even though the signal

1283
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:32,540
 can be quite different, you know,

1284
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:34,860
 acoustic signal, image signals,

1285
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:37,860
 but we can use the most basic elements

1286
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:40,560
 to represent each individual signals.

1287
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:44,120
 And this is where all of these fluid transform come from,

1288
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:44,960
 right?

1289
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:47,400
 They concluded that all signal can be generated

1290
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:50,720
 by combining nothing but the single source wave

1291
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:54,480
 with different frequency and amplitudes, right?

1292
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:57,120
 So the single source is actually referred to,

1293
01:44:57,120 --> 01:45:00,280
 just now we talk about, you know, this one, right?

1294
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,600
 This is actually the so-called the single source.

1295
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:05,960
 You can always decompose a very complicated signal

1296
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:09,960
 into a combination, not only, not one signal,

1297
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:12,680
 but many, many signal so is together, right?

1298
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:15,360
 This is where the fluid transform come from.

1299
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,760
 And of course, there are many versions

1300
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:21,440
 of fluid transform, we already talk about two,

1301
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,720
 CTFT and DTFT.

1302
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:25,720
 So DTFT will be something you need to know, okay?

1303
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:27,840
 So just now one still asked me like

1304
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:30,240
 whether the formula will be provided,

1305
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,480
 except for this one, I mean,

1306
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,640
 this one you're supposed to memorize it, okay?

1307
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:37,040
 DTFT, inverse DTFT, DFT,

1308
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,720
 which we're gonna see, discrete fluid transform,

1309
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,320
 sorry, inverse DFT.

1310
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:44,480
 So these are not formula, these are two, right?

1311
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,000
 You have to know it, okay?

1312
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,160
 So I may not give you this,

1313
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:49,480
 but it's very easy to remember, all right?

1314
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:50,720
 So how to remember it?

1315
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:54,680
 DTFT, clearly the starting point is DT, right?

1316
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:58,320
 So the right hand side of your transform

1317
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:01,800
 will be a discrete signal, right?

1318
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:05,120
 So there's a major difference between CTFT and DTFT.

1319
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:08,240
 And because your starting point is discrete signal,

1320
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:10,960
 you should do summation rather than integration.

1321
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,120
 You cannot do integration over the discrete signal.

1322
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:16,480
 So the right hand side will be a summation

1323
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:21,320
 of your discrete signal multiplied by a sinusoid, right?

1324
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:25,440
 So this is what we call a signal can be represented

1325
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,840
 by combining multiple sinusoids.

1326
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,519
 So this is the sinusoids, right?

1327
01:46:30,519 --> 01:46:32,800
 So you're saying that no matter how complex

1328
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:35,000
 your frequency spectrum is,

1329
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,500
 they can be represented as a summation

1330
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,320
 of multiple sinusoids.

1331
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:42,180
 And the weights are determined by the XN.

1332
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:44,080
 So you can just sum them together.

1333
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,700
 You can form the corresponding frequency, right?

1334
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:49,780
 So that's how you can generate the left hand side,

1335
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:53,740
 which is the frequency spectrum of the discrete signal.

1336
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:55,180
 And you can do inverse, right?

1337
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:56,620
 You can always get it back.

1338
01:46:56,620 --> 01:47:00,100
 You can recover the signal from the spectrum.

1339
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:03,540
 So remember, the spectrum is continuous.

1340
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:06,540
 Later, we're going to learn DTFT, which is discrete,

1341
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:10,060
 but DTFT, even though the signal originally

1342
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:12,300
 is discreet in the time domain,

1343
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:14,300
 the frequency is continuous.

1344
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:17,420
 That's why you have omega, not K, right?

1345
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:20,140
 Omega here is actually a continuous frequency, right?

1346
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:24,080
 You can get it back from the continuous frequency spectrum

1347
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:27,580
 to the signal by doing integration, okay?

1348
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:29,540
 So when you do integration,

1349
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:32,660
 you only need to do minus pi to pi.

1350
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:33,960
 Why?

1351
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,260
 Just don't we know that?

1352
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:39,260
 The DTFT spectrum is always two pi periodic.

1353
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:40,860
 Remember, we just say that?

1354
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:41,900
 Because it's periodic,

1355
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:44,580
 even if you integrate over entire range,

1356
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:46,460
 it doesn't give you anything new, right?

1357
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,860
 We only care about one period.

1358
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:51,460
 So that's why you only need to do integration

1359
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:54,380
 within the two pi period, okay?

1360
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:56,100
 So this is how you can memorize it.

1361
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:58,540
 And also you have to multiply by the sinusoid, right?

1362
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:01,700
 Which is e to the power of j omega n

1363
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:04,460
 because the n is the discrete variable.

1364
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:06,380
 So n must be there.

1365
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:08,580
 Okay, but don't forget the scale, right?

1366
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:10,500
 Why you need to scale by two pi?

1367
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,660
 It depends on how large,

1368
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:15,220
 how wide your integration range is.

1369
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:16,780
 If the range is two pi period,

1370
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:19,140
 you have normalized by two pi, right?

1371
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:20,980
 If it's four pi period, you have normalized by four pi.

1372
01:48:20,980 --> 01:48:23,140
 So it's going to normalize such that

1373
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:26,060
 you don't really have this scale ambiguity, right?

1374
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:30,380
 It's gonna make sure you go back to the right scale, okay?

1375
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:31,660
 So this is how you can memorize it.

1376
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:35,500
 But just say that forward is summation,

1377
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:38,500
 minus infinity to plus infinity.

1378
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:41,500
 Universe integration, but only within two pi range.

1379
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:42,900
 And don't forget the normalization.

1380
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:45,420
 That's how you can memorize it, all right?

1381
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:47,820
 So this is basically the DTFT.

1382
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:51,099
 And we always say that DTFT have this periodic property.

1383
01:48:51,099 --> 01:48:54,940
 In other words, no matter what kind of signals,

1384
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:58,980
 you will always have a spectrum that is two pi period, right?

1385
01:48:59,019 --> 01:49:03,099
 So this is actually also a result of

1386
01:49:03,099 --> 01:49:05,860
 AD is in formula, just now we just say it, right?

1387
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:10,660
 And this is your time domain, right?

1388
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:13,940
 You are discreet and you end up with the frequency like this.

1389
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:17,099
 And one period is actually between the base band,

1390
01:49:17,099 --> 01:49:19,219
 the first replica, right?

1391
01:49:19,219 --> 01:49:20,339
 So this is the visualization.

1392
01:49:20,339 --> 01:49:22,059
 And this is actually the inverse,

1393
01:49:22,059 --> 01:49:26,299
 sorry, forward and inverse transform of DTFT, okay?

1394
01:49:27,459 --> 01:49:28,339
 All right.

1395
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:33,140
 So DTFT, also a few things to be noted.

1396
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:36,620
 First one is this symmetric property, all right?

1397
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:37,940
 So as you can see, right?

1398
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:41,260
 Most of the frequency you will realize is actually symmetric.

1399
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:43,620
 Means that the positive and negative are equal.

1400
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:47,780
 But there's a very, very important condition.

1401
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:52,620
 That is your signal, time domain signal must be real, okay?

1402
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:55,940
 If I ask you, say, hey, is it true to say that

1403
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:59,780
 the spectra of any signal is always symmetric,

1404
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:00,940
 is wrong, okay?

1405
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:02,660
 Not true.

1406
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:05,219
 Symmetric property is only true

1407
01:50:05,219 --> 01:50:09,099
 if your original signal is real, okay?

1408
01:50:09,099 --> 01:50:12,019
 Most likely you have real signal, like when I talk,

1409
01:50:12,019 --> 01:50:13,259
 when I have an image, it's real.

1410
01:50:13,259 --> 01:50:18,259
 But there are some signal in practice are complex.

1411
01:50:18,419 --> 01:50:19,540
 Surprisingly, it's complex.

1412
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:21,299
 For example, radar signal, right?

1413
01:50:21,299 --> 01:50:24,900
 If any of you know, like when you talk about EM, right?

1414
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:26,980
 It's actually complex.

1415
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:27,940
 MI, right?

1416
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:31,660
 Magnetic resonance imaging is also complex.

1417
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:34,620
 So there are some signals which are complex.

1418
01:50:34,620 --> 01:50:38,219
 And if you look at their spectrum, it's not symmetric, okay?

1419
01:50:38,219 --> 01:50:40,460
 So it's a symmetric for most of the case,

1420
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:43,980
 but you have to make sure the signal is real, all right?

1421
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:47,460
 So this is a common mistake people make, all right?

1422
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,219
 But if you have a real signal,

1423
01:50:49,219 --> 01:50:50,860
 you have this symmetric property.

1424
01:50:50,860 --> 01:50:53,660
 In other words, if you look at amplitude,

1425
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:56,180
 it's always symmetric, right?

1426
01:50:56,180 --> 01:50:58,620
 So the positive side equal to the negative side,

1427
01:50:58,620 --> 01:51:01,139
 but this is actually the magnitude.

1428
01:51:01,139 --> 01:51:05,980
 Not exactly the same because you have to consider phase, right?

1429
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:08,820
 Even if you have a real signal, if you do DTFT,

1430
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:11,059
 you are going to end up with complex number,

1431
01:51:11,059 --> 01:51:12,099
 not real number.

1432
01:51:12,099 --> 01:51:14,700
 So any complex number will have two parts,

1433
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:18,980
 either real plus imaginary or magnitude plus phase, right?

1434
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:22,780
 So when we say symmetric, it's just the magnitude,

1435
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:23,860
 it's equal, right?

1436
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:26,420
 Phase will be the complex conjugate,

1437
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:28,700
 means it's going to be the opposite.

1438
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:31,259
 So you can consider this as magnitude,

1439
01:51:31,259 --> 01:51:34,940
 even symmetric, phase or symmetric.

1440
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:38,219
 So phase is the opposite, magnitude is the same, right?

1441
01:51:38,219 --> 01:51:40,019
 This is how you can remember this.

1442
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:44,580
 But of course, if we're talking about real signal, right?

1443
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:47,660
 Due to this symmetry property,

1444
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:52,219
 most likely, right, we can only just use half of the spectrum

1445
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:55,980
 because the other half, you can perfectly derive it, right?

1446
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:58,060
 So it doesn't give you anything new.

1447
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:01,660
 This is true for real signal,

1448
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:05,180
 so most likely we just need to analyze or store

1449
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:08,060
 only half of the spectrum, right?

1450
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:09,540
 This is also very fair.

1451
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,460
 For example, if you have real signal,

1452
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:15,180
 in principle, you actually assume the imaginary to be zero,

1453
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:16,020
 right?

1454
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:18,500
 You already lose half of the information.

1455
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:22,060
 So corresponding the spectrum, you only need half.

1456
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:24,540
 If you have complex signal, you have this imaginary part,

1457
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:27,180
 you also have to pay the price to store the spectrum, right?

1458
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:29,940
 So you cannot only save the half, okay?

1459
01:52:29,940 --> 01:52:30,780
 This is fair.

1460
01:52:30,780 --> 01:52:34,380
 But for this subject, most likely we're talking about

1461
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:37,620
 real signal, so you can assume that only half of the spectrum

1462
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:39,060
 will be enough, okay?

1463
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:42,540
 Because the other way you can directly derive it, okay?

1464
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:46,260
 And you can consider that the next half will be just a mirror,

1465
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:47,100
 right?

1466
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:49,140
 You can just mirror it from the middle point,

1467
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:51,340
 half of the FT, right?

1468
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:55,020
 And this spectrum is often given in terms of only the frequency

1469
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:57,980
 range from zero to FT, right?

1470
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:01,540
 And in the radius will be just zero to omega t, right?

1471
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:05,460
 So other parts can be just by repeating this period, right?

1472
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:08,620
 So actually periodic function.

1473
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:10,740
 If you normalize that is a corresponding way,

1474
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:13,140
 you can normalize the frequency, you can normalize the radius,

1475
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:14,300
 right?

1476
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:18,980
 Okay, so, yeah, just now it's about the DTFT, right?

1477
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:22,379
 So you can also do this practice, right?

1478
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:26,700
 You can try to calculate the impulse response of an ideal

1479
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:28,219
 low-pass filter, right?

1480
01:53:28,219 --> 01:53:30,660
 So suppose this is my low-pass filter.

1481
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:34,900
 Low-pass filter is nothing but equal to one within that

1482
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:37,700
 frequency range, zero outside the frequency range.

1483
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:41,500
 And mathematically, low-pass filter is a rectangular function,

1484
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:42,099
 right?

1485
01:53:42,099 --> 01:53:46,059
 So if you want to do a so-called impulse response of this

1486
01:53:46,059 --> 01:53:48,820
 filter, what does that mean?

1487
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:49,900
 I give you a filter, right?

1488
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:51,820
 I know this filter is low-pass filter.

1489
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:55,660
 I want you to give me impulse response of this filter.

1490
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:57,420
 So mathematically, what does that mean?

1491
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:03,500
 So first thing about that, like when I say low-pass filter,

1492
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:07,540
 am I describing the frequency domain property or time domain

1493
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:09,540
 property of the filter?

1494
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:13,500
 Frequency, because low-pass means low-frequency pass, right?

1495
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:17,019
 When I say impulse response, am I talking about the time domain

1496
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:20,940
 signal or the frequency domain signal?

1497
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:24,340
 Think about an impulse response.

1498
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:26,780
 Do you know what is impulse response?

1499
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:28,300
 Impulse response means I have a signal.

1500
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:29,660
 I have a system, right?

1501
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:31,700
 I give the system an impulse signal.

1502
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:34,100
 I want to see what's the output.

1503
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:38,260
 So the output of the system, when I inject an impulse signal

1504
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:42,820
 as an input, the output is called impulse response, OK?

1505
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:44,140
 So I didn't know.

1506
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:46,820
 OK, so this is the definition, all right?

1507
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:51,059
 So if I ask you, what is the impulse response of a signal,

1508
01:54:51,059 --> 01:54:56,660
 am I asking a time domain signal or frequency domain signal?

1509
01:54:56,660 --> 01:54:59,340
 Time domain, because impulse, think about injecting the signal

1510
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:01,059
 to the system, right?

1511
01:55:01,059 --> 01:55:06,460
 These impulse will be only have impulse at a certain time.

1512
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:08,580
 So it's actually time domain signal, right?

1513
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:12,580
 And the expected outcome is also time domain, right?

1514
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:13,700
 Time domain signal.

1515
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:17,900
 So how can I know the time domain signal of my impulse?

1516
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:30,580
 It's actually the inverse DTFT of the frequency spectrum

1517
01:55:30,580 --> 01:55:31,820
 of the low-pass filter.

1518
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:34,340
 So imagine you have a frequency response.

1519
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:37,019
 You have a frequency spectrum of the filter, right?

1520
01:55:37,019 --> 01:55:41,660
 This is the frequency representation of the filter,

1521
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:42,380
 right?

1522
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:47,060
 But when I'm talking about impulse response of the system,

1523
01:55:47,060 --> 01:55:50,700
 right, I'm asking you the time domain representation

1524
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:53,820
 of the filter, right?

1525
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:57,940
 So what I need, actually, is the inverse DTFT

1526
01:55:57,940 --> 01:56:00,700
 of my low-pass filter spectrum.

1527
01:56:05,140 --> 01:56:07,220
 OK, how many of you never heard of impulse response?

1528
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:11,100
 I thought this should be taught in your analog signal course.

1529
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:13,700
 Have you learned this in the analog signal?

1530
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:14,660
 Impulse response, right?

1531
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:18,140
 So how can I tell what is the impulse response of a system?

1532
01:56:18,140 --> 01:56:21,660
 I need to figure out what is the time domain representation

1533
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:23,420
 of the filter, right?

1534
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:26,900
 So how can I get the time domain representation of the filter

1535
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:29,580
 given a frequency spectrum?

1536
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:31,380
 I need to do inverse DTFT, right?

1537
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:33,220
 In this time, it's inverse DTFT.

1538
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:36,220
 But here, we have to do inverse DTFT, right?

1539
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:41,860
 So in this case, you can tell from the low-pass filter

1540
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:44,900
 what the frequency spectrum is for this filter, right?

1541
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:47,500
 It is a spectacular function, right?

1542
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:48,980
 I need to know the impulse response.

1543
01:56:48,980 --> 01:56:54,060
 What I need to do is to do inverse DTFT of this guy

1544
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:56,820
 to convert it back from the frequency spectrum

1545
01:56:56,820 --> 01:57:01,260
 to the discrete time signal, right?

1546
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:02,180
 So how can I do it?

1547
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:06,060
 I can apply my inverse DTFT we just learned, right?

1548
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:10,580
 By doing integration over the, you know, I mean,

1549
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:12,740
 ideally it should be 2 pi, but because here,

1550
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:16,500
 you know that this bandwidth is limited by minus omega c

1551
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:17,100
 and c, right?

1552
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:19,700
 You can directly do integration over these two.

1553
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:23,020
 I mean, if you do minus pi to pi, it's all going to be zero,

1554
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:25,740
 right, in this high-pass range.

1555
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:29,740
 So you can't get limited to only minus omega to omega, OK?

1556
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:32,300
 And you know that within the range is equal to 1, right?

1557
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:35,260
 Because this is actually an amplitude of 1.

1558
01:57:35,260 --> 01:57:36,580
 You can just substitute 1.

1559
01:57:36,580 --> 01:57:38,300
 You do a simplification.

1560
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:41,420
 You will have a sync function, right?

1561
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:44,300
 So a low-pass filter, if you look at the time domain response,

1562
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:46,820
 it's always a sync function, right?

1563
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:49,900
 Because that's how you can do IDTFT to get back

1564
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:53,060
 to the time domain, right?

1565
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:55,380
 So this is actually a very simple.

1566
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:59,660
 You just apply IDTFT to the spectrum,

1567
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:02,300
 but you have to understand what does the impulse response mean,

1568
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:04,500
 right?

1569
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,380
 OK, you can check, but I already explained to you.

1570
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:10,460
 Impulse function is the output if you inject the impulse

1571
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:12,700
 function as input to the system, right?

1572
01:58:12,700 --> 01:58:15,500
 The corresponding output is the impulse response

1573
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:18,340
 of that filter, right?

1574
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:22,620
 So if you observe the waveform of this impulse response,

1575
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:25,460
 you can tell that this signal will

1576
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:28,740
 appear at both future time and past time, right?

1577
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:30,060
 Just now one of you asked me a question,

1578
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:32,660
 say, how can I have a time which is negative, right?

1579
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:35,099
 In fact, this is a problem, but mathematically,

1580
01:58:35,099 --> 01:58:37,460
 this is what you got, OK?

1581
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:40,900
 But this function, or this filter,

1582
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:43,099
 may not be realizable because there

1583
01:58:43,099 --> 01:58:44,580
 are some value in the future, right?

1584
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:47,820
 How can you design an impulse response which

1585
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:49,540
 is happening at the future?

1586
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:53,860
 So normally, if you observe an impulse response which

1587
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:58,099
 are spread out in the time domain, which is normally,

1588
01:58:58,099 --> 01:59:01,860
 we call it the not causal or not realizable, right?

1589
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:03,980
 So this is a problem not for math,

1590
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:06,820
 but for practical implementation, all right?

1591
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:09,820
 So let's define what does the causal mean here, right?

1592
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:12,500
 So we say a system is causal, right?

1593
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,500
 You may have heard of the term causal, right?

1594
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:17,540
 Causality, like LTI system.

1595
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:19,820
 OK, so C stands for causal, right?

1596
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:22,339
 So we say a system is causal if you

1597
01:59:22,339 --> 01:59:26,740
 can represent the output only using past or present

1598
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:29,460
 value of the input.

1599
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:32,340
 So if I have an output y, which is only

1600
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:37,620
 a function of the current time x or past time x, this is fine.

1601
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:39,820
 So this is called causal, right?

1602
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:43,340
 Because you do not need the future value of the input

1603
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:44,460
 to generate the output.

1604
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:46,660
 So this is causal, right?

1605
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:48,980
 So for example, there are two options, right?

1606
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:53,820
 If my output is equal to yn, current time n,

1607
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:57,940
 is equal to the current time x plus the past time x,

1608
01:59:57,940 --> 02:00:01,900
 this is fine, because I already see my past time values.

1609
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:03,540
 I can generate my output.

1610
02:00:03,540 --> 02:00:08,299
 But if I have an output that depends on the future value

1611
02:00:08,299 --> 02:00:10,980
 of x, you cannot do it, because you never

1612
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:14,379
 know the future value at the current time step, right?

1613
02:00:14,379 --> 02:00:16,940
 So this is called non-causal, because there's

1614
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:19,259
 a dependency to the future.

1615
02:00:19,259 --> 02:00:24,099
 So this is normally not realizable in practice, all right?

1616
02:00:24,100 --> 02:00:27,500
 So now the question is, now we can

1617
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:31,380
 design some good filter, just like the filter here, right?

1618
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:32,740
 This is the perfect low-pass filter.

1619
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:34,020
 We want to use it.

1620
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:35,380
 We like it mathematically.

1621
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:39,060
 But we just cannot have a filter like this,

1622
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:42,500
 because output depends on future of input, right?

1623
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:46,380
 So how can I first, how can I make sure the system is

1624
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:48,660
 causal system, right?

1625
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:50,420
 You have to measure that.

1626
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:51,140
 How to do that?

1627
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:54,940
 You have to work out this relationship between output

1628
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:56,380
 and input.

1629
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:58,580
 If you find there's a dependency on future,

1630
02:00:58,580 --> 02:01:01,220
 means this system is non-causal, right?

1631
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:03,620
 So you know that this system, even though it's good,

1632
02:01:03,620 --> 02:01:06,860
 but not realizable in practice, OK?

1633
02:01:06,860 --> 02:01:12,300
 So the signal is that if you see any x depends on future time,

1634
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:14,980
 it means it's non-causal, all right?

1635
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:17,420
 So you have to somehow get rid of it.

1636
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:21,460
 You have to modify your filter to make it causal,

1637
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:24,580
 because only so you can make it, right?

1638
02:01:24,580 --> 02:01:26,020
 You can generate it.

1639
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:27,060
 OK, how can you do it?

1640
02:01:27,060 --> 02:01:32,460
 Well, a common way people do it is by add a face, add a face term.

1641
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:35,620
 All right, just now this response has nothing

1642
02:01:35,620 --> 02:01:37,100
 to do with face, right?

1643
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:40,620
 It's just an amplitude only, zero face, all right?

1644
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:42,020
 I didn't consider any face here.

1645
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:43,220
 So it's actually one, right?

1646
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:46,020
 It's a real number, only magnitude, face zero.

1647
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:49,180
 But I will end up with some non-causal filter.

1648
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:54,020
 One thing we can do is by shift all the signal to the past,

1649
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:54,340
 right?

1650
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:57,300
 So you can actually make the future value like past.

1651
02:01:57,300 --> 02:01:59,940
 So a shift in the time domain will

1652
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:04,060
 be a face change in the frequency domain.

1653
02:02:04,060 --> 02:02:06,740
 This is another trick people normally play, right?

1654
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:10,060
 You want to generate a shift, let's say, in the time domain.

1655
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:11,940
 You do face change in the frequency.

1656
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:13,180
 The other way, also the same.

1657
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:16,700
 You want to do, how should I say, face change in time,

1658
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:19,140
 you will do a shift of frequency, right?

1659
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:21,700
 So this is like a correspond, just like multiplication

1660
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:24,180
 in time, just equal to convolution in frequency, right?

1661
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:27,940
 This is another commonly used pairs when we do manipulation,

1662
02:02:27,940 --> 02:02:28,300
 right?

1663
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:32,380
 So here, if I want to have a shift of the entire impulse

1664
02:02:32,380 --> 02:02:35,140
 response, what I can do is add a face term.

1665
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:38,620
 I'm saying that, well, within my low pass range,

1666
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:41,500
 still the magnitude is equal to 1.

1667
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:44,060
 But I will have a face, which is also

1668
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:46,660
 a function of omega here.

1669
02:02:46,660 --> 02:02:48,700
 In other words, the face is not equal to 0.

1670
02:02:48,700 --> 02:02:51,140
 It's going to be a linear function.

1671
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:54,820
 OK, so adding this face, in other words, the linear face

1672
02:02:54,820 --> 02:03:00,460
 here, if you again do the inverse DTFT, you will find that.

1673
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:03,500
 I will have a zinc function, which is still a zinc.

1674
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:07,620
 But the entire zinc is shifted to the past, right?

1675
02:03:07,620 --> 02:03:10,300
 So you have a corresponding time shift

1676
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:14,540
 when you have a face change in the frequency domain, right?

1677
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:18,700
 And by doing so, you are going to delay the impulse function,

1678
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:22,060
 impulse response, by a certain range, all right?

1679
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:25,220
 So you can tell that the face here is actually

1680
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:27,620
 minus n divided by 2.

1681
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:30,220
 The time shift will also be equal to n divided by 2, right?

1682
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:33,100
 So there's a correspondence between the two.

1683
02:03:33,100 --> 02:03:34,940
 OK, if you do so, well, you still

1684
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:36,780
 have something left in the future, right?

1685
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:39,340
 But I can do a truncation, right?

1686
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:41,380
 I just forget about those smaller future values.

1687
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:42,700
 I just forget it.

1688
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:44,340
 I only keep the past value, right?

1689
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:47,660
 This is one way to design the filter in practice.

1690
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:49,700
 You won't have exactly the ideal low pass,

1691
02:03:49,700 --> 02:03:51,780
 but you have a good enough low pass.

1692
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:53,580
 Where is the face shift?

1693
02:03:53,580 --> 02:03:55,700
 Right, so this is one way you can somehow

1694
02:03:55,700 --> 02:03:59,540
 make a non-causal system to be causal,

1695
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:02,540
 to make your impulse response to be

1696
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:08,060
 within a finite duration and shifted by a certain range,

1697
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:08,260
 right?

1698
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:10,980
 This is one way you can do it, all right?

1699
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:12,220
 But two things.

1700
02:04:12,220 --> 02:04:16,660
 First, you need to know how to identify a signal, whether it's

1701
02:04:16,660 --> 02:04:18,260
 causal or non-causal.

1702
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:19,580
 That's step one.

1703
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:20,300
 How to identify?

1704
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:23,140
 You have to look at this function, right?

1705
02:04:23,140 --> 02:04:26,100
 To see whether there's any dependency on future.

1706
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:28,500
 Yes, it means non-causal.

1707
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:30,340
 Nothing means causal, all right?

1708
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:32,300
 Second thing is how to solve it,

1709
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:35,620
 how to change the non-causal system to causal.

1710
02:04:35,620 --> 02:04:38,780
 It's by introducing a face shift here, right?

1711
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:40,860
 The face shift will be some linear function

1712
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:43,540
 of my face change as a function of frequency.

1713
02:04:43,540 --> 02:04:46,380
 And by doing so, you will have a face not equal to zero,

1714
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:47,900
 but as a linear function.

1715
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:49,620
 So the face shift in frequency will

1716
02:04:49,620 --> 02:04:53,660
 be corresponding to a time delay in the impulse response.

1717
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:56,500
 So this is how you can convert the non-causal system

1718
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:57,059
 to causal system.

1719
02:04:57,059 --> 02:04:59,700
 So you have to know two things, all right?

1720
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:00,700
 Yes?

1721
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:04,540
 Which side of the face is the non-causal?

1722
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:07,780
 So normally the signal will come in from, let's say,

1723
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:10,019
 from here, arriving from left to right.

1724
02:05:10,019 --> 02:05:13,100
 So whatever after the zero will be the future,

1725
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:14,700
 oh sorry, will be in the past, whatever

1726
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:17,580
 have arrived will be the future.

1727
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:19,580
 Yeah, yes?

1728
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:21,700
 I always know if the signal is called

1729
02:05:21,700 --> 02:05:24,340
 causal from the spectrum.

1730
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:26,540
 It's causal from the spectrum, right?

1731
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:28,140
 Not very, sorry?

1732
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:32,220
 Do I have to transfer it from the spectrum to the function?

1733
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:34,500
 It's better to transfer, because it's not very obvious.

1734
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:37,300
 If you're good, you can tell, but not very obvious.

1735
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:38,340
 Every time it's obvious.

1736
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:39,540
 So it's better to, OK.

1737
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:43,060
 So this is a very good question.

1738
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:46,900
 So I would really recommend to Anna with here,

1739
02:05:46,900 --> 02:05:50,380
 only when you have this equation to make a decision.

1740
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:52,700
 Otherwise, it may be risky, right?

1741
02:05:52,700 --> 02:05:55,460
 But I'm not saying you cannot do it.

1742
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:57,260
 Some can still do it, right?

1743
02:05:57,260 --> 02:05:58,660
 But it's not very reliable.

1744
02:05:58,660 --> 02:06:00,460
 Sometimes you may make a mistake.

1745
02:06:00,460 --> 02:06:02,460
 So I would strongly encourage you

1746
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:05,020
 to have this input-output relationship

1747
02:06:05,020 --> 02:06:09,580
 to tell the difference, to tell whether it's causal or not.

1748
02:06:09,580 --> 02:06:10,380
 This is the one way.

1749
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:15,820
 The other way is to figure out the time impulse response.

1750
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:17,420
 The impulse response can also tell you

1751
02:06:17,420 --> 02:06:20,300
 whether it's causal or non-causal, right?

1752
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:20,800
 OK.

1753
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:23,140
 But in the exam, it should give you something simpler, right?

1754
02:06:23,140 --> 02:06:24,980
 They won't give you a super complicated function

1755
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:27,700
 to do ID, TFT, right?

1756
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:29,140
 But you should know the principle, right?

1757
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:31,820
 How can you tell, and how can you make a change, right?

1758
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:33,680
 OK, great.

1759
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:34,340
 Any other question?

1760
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:38,100
 OK, good.

1761
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:41,940
 So this is something to do with the causality, right?

1762
02:06:41,940 --> 02:06:46,340
 And also, just now I'm saying that even if I do a time delay,

1763
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:50,100
 I still end up with infinitely long impulse response, right?

1764
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:52,500
 The z-function can actually go to infinity.

1765
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:55,260
 So another way people normally do is by a truncation.

1766
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:59,100
 They will drop the signals, maybe beyond a certain range.

1767
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:02,260
 So you are going to convert an infinitely long signal

1768
02:07:02,260 --> 02:07:04,460
 to a finite length signal.

1769
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:09,140
 OK, even though if you do this, even though, for example,

1770
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:13,020
 the signal Iq is very small, it still gives you some artifacts.

1771
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:16,860
 In other words, if you do so by truncating the impulse

1772
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:20,060
 response to a finite length, you will not end up

1773
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:23,340
 with a perfect low pass filter.

1774
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:26,740
 Normally, if you have this kind of very sharp transition,

1775
02:07:26,740 --> 02:07:30,900
 it means your impulse response will be infinitely long, right?

1776
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:32,140
 But this is not practical.

1777
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:33,860
 You have to do some kind of truncation.

1778
02:07:33,860 --> 02:07:37,660
 But if you do truncation, make it finite length.

1779
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:40,340
 You have to introduce something called the repose.

1780
02:07:40,340 --> 02:07:43,580
 So later, week five or four, I'm going to talk about filter design.

1781
02:07:43,580 --> 02:07:45,620
 You will see the actual artifacts.

1782
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:48,940
 But you will have some artifacts.

1783
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:50,460
 On one side, you make it real.

1784
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:51,420
 You make it practical.

1785
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:54,940
 But also, you end up with non-ideal low pass filter.

1786
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:58,100
 And non-ideal is coming from the truncation.

1787
02:07:58,100 --> 02:08:01,580
 You truncate the infinite long signal

1788
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:03,180
 to a finite length signal.

1789
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:04,460
 This is where it comes from.

1790
02:08:04,460 --> 02:08:07,940
 So you will see some repose in the pass band and the stop band.

1791
02:08:07,940 --> 02:08:09,380
 And there will be a transition band

1792
02:08:09,380 --> 02:08:11,300
 between the stop and pass.

1793
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:13,540
 So this will be practical filter,

1794
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:15,100
 how the practical filter look like.

1795
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:18,780
 We'll get there.

1796
02:08:18,780 --> 02:08:20,420
 So just some preview.

1797
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:25,460
 We'll go to the details in week five, I think.

1798
02:08:25,460 --> 02:08:29,540
 Another thing is, just now we talk about causality.

1799
02:08:29,540 --> 02:08:32,820
 So we say that a practical system must be causal,

1800
02:08:32,820 --> 02:08:34,260
 because nobody can predict the future.

1801
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:36,220
 So it must be causal.

1802
02:08:36,220 --> 02:08:41,140
 And for this subject, we give two other conditions

1803
02:08:41,140 --> 02:08:41,980
 to make it simple.

1804
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:43,620
 Causal is one.

1805
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:47,780
 The other two is linear and timing variant.

1806
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:50,220
 So what do we mean by linear?

1807
02:08:50,220 --> 02:08:58,019
 Linear means the system will be, if you look at the,

1808
02:08:59,020 --> 02:09:02,180
 how should I say, the impulse response.

1809
02:09:02,180 --> 02:09:06,140
 You can always represent output as a convolution of input

1810
02:09:06,140 --> 02:09:08,180
 signal and impulse response.

1811
02:09:08,180 --> 02:09:11,780
 If so, this is a linear system.

1812
02:09:11,780 --> 02:09:13,260
 So it's a linear.

1813
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:17,660
 In variant means this impulse function will not change

1814
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:19,900
 from time to time.

1815
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:22,060
 The opposite is time varying.

1816
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:23,780
 Time varying means maybe at time one,

1817
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:25,620
 the impulse function look like this.

1818
02:09:25,620 --> 02:09:27,220
 But afterwards, it's going to change.

1819
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:28,300
 So this is time varying.

1820
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:30,860
 But time varying system will make the whole thing very

1821
02:09:30,860 --> 02:09:31,700
 complicated.

1822
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:33,220
 So for this subject, you can always

1823
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:38,900
 assume that the system is always linear and timing variant.

1824
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:43,300
 No change, always linear, or always can write as a convolution.

1825
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:47,660
 So in this case, under the LTI assumption,

1826
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:51,980
 we call it LTI system, linear timing variant causal system,

1827
02:09:51,980 --> 02:09:56,740
 you can always write the output as the convolution in time

1828
02:09:56,740 --> 02:10:01,460
 domain, the convolution of the input and the impulse response

1829
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:02,820
 of the system.

1830
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:05,340
 I believe all of you should learn this.

1831
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:06,820
 An analog signal is the same.

1832
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:08,460
 The only difference in analog signal,

1833
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:11,420
 you have to do integration.

1834
02:10:11,420 --> 02:10:13,660
 In digital signal, you just do summation

1835
02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:16,219
 when you do convolution.

1836
02:10:16,219 --> 02:10:21,099
 But basically, you can represent output either in terms

1837
02:10:21,099 --> 02:10:25,340
 of time domain convolution or frequency domain multiplication.

1838
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:29,420
 Either way, you can generate the output.

1839
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:32,900
 So basically, this is actually how you do it.

1840
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:36,020
 But this is called convolution.

1841
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:40,100
 So multiply, shifted, and summation

1842
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:43,060
 is actually same as convolution.

1843
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:47,820
 But convolution is actually permutable.

1844
02:10:47,820 --> 02:10:51,100
 You can actually do x come up with h, or h come up with x.

1845
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:52,380
 It's the same thing.

1846
02:10:52,380 --> 02:10:55,900
 Now, we're going to use the convolution notation as a star

1847
02:10:55,900 --> 02:10:57,180
 for the entire subject.

1848
02:10:57,180 --> 02:11:00,460
 Every time you see the star, it means convolution.

1849
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:01,820
 Dot means multiplication.

1850
02:11:01,820 --> 02:11:03,780
 Star means convolution.

1851
02:11:03,780 --> 02:11:06,100
 So also, just now, some of you asked me

1852
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:08,420
 about the impulse thing.

1853
02:11:08,420 --> 02:11:13,060
 If you remember, I show you just now.

1854
02:11:13,060 --> 02:11:14,340
 I hope you still remember.

1855
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:18,300
 There was a, where is it?

1856
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:19,820
 Sorry, much earlier.

1857
02:11:23,180 --> 02:11:24,060
 Where is it?

1858
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:24,900
 OK, here.

1859
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:27,260
 Just now, I show you a figure that's saying, well,

1860
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:30,620
 sampling is actually multiplication in time domain

1861
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:33,700
 between the time signal with impulse train.

1862
02:11:33,700 --> 02:11:36,580
 I say that, well, this is equal to, in the frequency domain,

1863
02:11:36,580 --> 02:11:39,940
 I'm convolved the frequency spectrum of the input signal.

1864
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:42,460
 Where is the impulse train?

1865
02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:43,700
 So just now, somebody asked me.

1866
02:11:43,700 --> 02:11:48,740
 So this is true because if you do a DTFT of the impulse train

1867
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:51,580
 in time domain, you will get a scaled version of the impulse

1868
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:53,740
 train in the frequency domain.

1869
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:58,700
 So impulse function, no matter you do inverse DTFT or DTFT,

1870
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:00,100
 the waveform will not change.

1871
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:02,220
 It's still impulse function.

1872
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:03,380
 So this is also important.

1873
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:07,140
 That's why here it says, whoops.

1874
02:12:10,340 --> 02:12:13,500
 So here it says that you have to be familiar with yourself

1875
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:17,700
 that impulse train, the time domain, if you do DTFT,

1876
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:19,620
 you will get another impulse train.

1877
02:12:19,620 --> 02:12:23,220
 But there's a scaling factor of the omega 0.

1878
02:12:23,220 --> 02:12:25,019
 But the waveform doesn't change.

1879
02:12:25,019 --> 02:12:28,780
 And this is actually how you can get to the alias

1880
02:12:28,780 --> 02:12:33,019
 informator to generate this replicas of your baseband

1881
02:12:33,019 --> 02:12:36,580
 frequency, sorry, baseband spectrum.

1882
02:12:36,580 --> 02:12:39,340
 But you can derive this by yourself using the DTFT

1883
02:12:39,340 --> 02:12:41,300
 and the inverse DTFT without a problem.

1884
02:12:41,300 --> 02:12:41,940
 You can try it.

1885
02:12:41,940 --> 02:12:45,059
 But the conclusion is that impulse function will not

1886
02:12:45,059 --> 02:12:46,860
 change the waveform if you do DTFT.

1887
02:12:50,380 --> 02:12:53,860
 So last topic, I know it's very late, but let's talk about

1888
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:55,059
 last topic.

1889
02:12:55,059 --> 02:12:56,500
 So we talk about DTFT.

1890
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:59,180
 We talk about CTTFT, then DTFT.

1891
02:12:59,180 --> 02:13:03,660
 The difference between CTTFT and DTFT is whether your

1892
02:13:03,660 --> 02:13:08,420
 input signal is continuous or discrete.

1893
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:10,620
 The continuous signal, you want to find a spectrum, you do

1894
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:11,260
 CTTFT.

1895
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:14,420
 Discrete signal, you want to find a spectrum, you do DTFT.

1896
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:20,220
 But both spectrum from CTTFT and DTFT, both of them are

1897
02:13:20,220 --> 02:13:22,620
 continuous.

1898
02:13:22,620 --> 02:13:24,060
 I'm talking about spectrum.

1899
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:30,420
 Spectrum for both CTTFT and DTFT are continuous.

1900
02:13:30,420 --> 02:13:33,140
 But we know that continuous states cannot be

1901
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:34,820
 stored in computer.

1902
02:13:34,820 --> 02:13:35,980
 Computer cannot store continuous.

1903
02:13:35,980 --> 02:13:38,620
 You have to somehow discretize it.

1904
02:13:38,620 --> 02:13:41,420
 This is the reason we need another, maybe the one last

1905
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:46,420
 we call it DFT, discrete Fourier transform.

1906
02:13:46,420 --> 02:13:48,660
 The name is very confusing.

1907
02:13:48,660 --> 02:13:52,300
 If you see a T there, it means you get a continuous

1908
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:53,420
 spectrum.

1909
02:13:53,420 --> 02:13:58,940
 Without a T, instead of DTFT, I say DFT, you end up with a

1910
02:13:58,940 --> 02:14:00,780
 discrete spectrum.

1911
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:04,140
 You get a discrete signal, you end up with a discrete

1912
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:04,620
 spectrum.

1913
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:07,340
 This is what the DFT is doing.

1914
02:14:07,340 --> 02:14:10,900
 So even though there's only one word different, it means

1915
02:14:10,900 --> 02:14:12,219
 different things.

1916
02:14:12,219 --> 02:14:15,259
 So now we're talking about a discrete Fourier transform,

1917
02:14:15,259 --> 02:14:16,219
 no time.

1918
02:14:16,219 --> 02:14:18,019
 Just discrete Fourier transform.

1919
02:14:18,019 --> 02:14:22,139
 So discrete Fourier transform, first, is going to deal

1920
02:14:22,139 --> 02:14:26,460
 with finite length discrete signal.

1921
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:29,580
 So just now here we have to talk about how many points

1922
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:31,339
 we have.

1923
02:14:31,339 --> 02:14:33,900
 So if it's n points, we're going to say this is n

1924
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:37,019
 point DFT.

1925
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:41,260
 So DFT, just like DTFT, you have forward transform, you

1926
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:42,980
 have inverse transform.

1927
02:14:42,980 --> 02:14:46,460
 Both ways, we obtain the spectrum and get back to the

1928
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:47,300
 signal.

1929
02:14:47,300 --> 02:14:51,740
 But both the left-hand side and right-hand side are

1930
02:14:51,740 --> 02:14:54,220
 discrete.

1931
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:57,220
 You start with discrete n point signal, you end up with

1932
02:14:57,220 --> 02:15:00,260
 n point discrete spectrum.

1933
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:02,460
 So this is the property for DFT.

1934
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:04,300
 The dimension doesn't change.

1935
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:07,500
 The format doesn't change.

1936
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:08,580
 OK, let me repeat.

1937
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:11,780
 DTFT, you start with a discrete signal, you end up with

1938
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:13,540
 continuous spectrum.

1939
02:15:13,540 --> 02:15:14,980
 That's DTFT.

1940
02:15:14,980 --> 02:15:19,940
 DFT, you start from n point discrete signal.

1941
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:24,460
 You end up with exactly same length n point discrete

1942
02:15:24,460 --> 02:15:25,460
 spectrum.

1943
02:15:25,460 --> 02:15:27,100
 So you don't change the dimension.

1944
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:30,700
 The dimension is the same, with or without this DFT.

1945
02:15:30,700 --> 02:15:31,900
 So this is the most important part.

1946
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:35,540
 So that's why I'm having the right-hand side, xn, to be

1947
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:37,700
 within 0 to n minus 1.

1948
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:42,339
 When I do this, I will end up with another spectrum, xk,

1949
02:15:42,339 --> 02:15:45,660
 which k also range from 0 to n minus 1.

1950
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:46,620
 So length is the same.

1951
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:48,900
 In other words, later we're going to see that this

1952
02:15:48,900 --> 02:15:51,620
 transform is a square transform.

1953
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:54,099
 You are multiplying the square transform to a vector.

1954
02:15:54,099 --> 02:15:57,019
 You get the same dimension of the vector as the output.

1955
02:15:57,019 --> 02:15:59,299
 So that's why people love it, because you can represent a

1956
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:05,020
 DFT perfectly using a square transform, a matrix.

1957
02:16:05,020 --> 02:16:06,900
 And also another thing is the base.

1958
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:10,460
 Remember, DTFT, the base is equal e to the power of minus

1959
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:12,580
 j omega n.

1960
02:16:12,580 --> 02:16:14,060
 Remember, that's the DTFT.

1961
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:18,180
 Now, DFT, there's no omega, because it's discrete.

1962
02:16:18,180 --> 02:16:19,820
 You won't have omega.

1963
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:24,500
 What you have are two integers, small n and a small k.

1964
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:28,580
 Small n is the index for discrete time domain.

1965
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:31,059
 k is the index for discrete frequency domain.

1966
02:16:31,059 --> 02:16:33,780
 You need to have both.

1967
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:37,500
 The other thing is the same, j 2 pi, but divided by n.

1968
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:41,980
 So this n is the n point you have, the larger the n,

1969
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:45,340
 the larger the denominator.

1970
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:48,139
 So four-way transform have a minus.

1971
02:16:48,139 --> 02:16:49,940
 Inverse transform doesn't have a minus.

1972
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:51,100
 That's the difference.

1973
02:16:51,100 --> 02:16:54,940
 But basically, both of them will be doing summation,

1974
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:58,059
 rather than integration.

1975
02:16:58,059 --> 02:17:00,859
 Here is another normalization term.

1976
02:17:00,859 --> 02:17:03,619
 But it only normalizes at one side.

1977
02:17:03,619 --> 02:17:04,299
 It depends.

1978
02:17:04,299 --> 02:17:07,660
 You will see some other version of the DFT that says, here,

1979
02:17:07,660 --> 02:17:10,180
 I have a 1 over square root of n.

1980
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:11,580
 Here, another square root of n.

1981
02:17:11,580 --> 02:17:12,900
 It's just a scaling factor.

1982
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:13,740
 It doesn't matter.

1983
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:17,740
 But together, you have to divide it by n to get it back.

1984
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:20,420
 So for this subject, let's just think about that the

1985
02:17:20,420 --> 02:17:22,219
 inverse transform have this scaling.

1986
02:17:22,219 --> 02:17:26,459
 Forward doesn't have a scaling, just for simplicity.

1987
02:17:26,539 --> 02:17:28,900
 So this is DFT.

1988
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:34,500
 DFT can be considered as a sample version of DTFT.

1989
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:39,059
 Remember, DTFT, you have a continuous spectrum, omega.

1990
02:17:39,059 --> 02:17:44,059
 Now, if you want to relate DFT to DTFT, you can consider

1991
02:17:44,059 --> 02:17:47,980
 DFT as a sample version of DTFT.

1992
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:51,139
 I'm going to show you in a minute how exactly.

1993
02:17:51,139 --> 02:17:53,059
 Maybe now, I'm going to show you this first.

1994
02:17:53,059 --> 02:17:55,779
 So just now, I showed you that how you can go from CTFT to

1995
02:17:55,779 --> 02:17:56,740
 DTFT.

1996
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:57,740
 Remember?

1997
02:17:57,740 --> 02:17:59,539
 I'm saying that the difference happens at the

1998
02:17:59,539 --> 02:18:00,660
 sampling stage.

1999
02:18:00,660 --> 02:18:03,900
 I'm sampling the time domain signal as an impulse train.

2000
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:05,820
 I end up with a convolution.

2001
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:09,100
 So this is how you can go from CTFT to DTFT.

2002
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:10,379
 Now, I go one step further.

2003
02:18:10,379 --> 02:18:15,539
 I want to go from DTFT to DFT.

2004
02:18:15,539 --> 02:18:20,260
 So what I'm doing now is a sampling of the frequency

2005
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:21,580
 spectrum.

2006
02:18:21,580 --> 02:18:25,420
 Remember, DTFT gives you a continuous spectrum in the

2007
02:18:25,420 --> 02:18:26,860
 frequency omega.

2008
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:29,100
 Now, I want to have a discrete spectrum.

2009
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:32,900
 So you can consider this as equivalent sampling in the

2010
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:34,500
 frequency domain.

2011
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:35,980
 How to do sampling in the frequency domain?

2012
02:18:35,980 --> 02:18:38,059
 You can just do a multiplication of the impulse

2013
02:18:38,059 --> 02:18:38,539
 train.

2014
02:18:38,539 --> 02:18:40,299
 Same trick.

2015
02:18:40,299 --> 02:18:43,780
 So that's why you can end up with something like this.

2016
02:18:43,780 --> 02:18:47,539
 So it's like a sample version of my DTFT spectrum.

2017
02:18:47,539 --> 02:18:50,740
 And this is what you get for DFT.

2018
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:54,820
 So here from here is go from CTFT to DTFT.

2019
02:18:54,820 --> 02:18:58,619
 You can also do one step further to reach the DFT.

2020
02:18:58,619 --> 02:19:01,420
 If you do inverse DFT, you end up with the original signal

2021
02:19:01,420 --> 02:19:03,820
 but with the sample version.

2022
02:19:03,820 --> 02:19:08,780
 So I hope this figure somehow unifies all of the three

2023
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:10,260
 transforms we learned.

2024
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:11,180
 But it's just an illustration.

2025
02:19:11,180 --> 02:19:12,900
 I'm not deriving this mathematical.

2026
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:13,619
 I have promised.

2027
02:19:13,619 --> 02:19:15,740
 I try to minimize the mathematics.

2028
02:19:15,740 --> 02:19:17,539
 And I won't really test you on that.

2029
02:19:17,539 --> 02:19:19,619
 But I hope you have a feeling.

2030
02:19:19,620 --> 02:19:21,180
 These three are not something separate.

2031
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:23,380
 These three are related.

2032
02:19:23,380 --> 02:19:26,140
 Just like how you want to sample time domain, you want to

2033
02:19:26,140 --> 02:19:28,460
 sample frequency domain, you end up with a different

2034
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:29,740
 transform.

2035
02:19:29,740 --> 02:19:33,220
 But it's the same kind of principle.

2036
02:19:33,220 --> 02:19:36,500
 So this is how you can relate.

2037
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:39,820
 But for DFT, there's one concept.

2038
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:40,820
 Very important.

2039
02:19:40,820 --> 02:19:43,020
 I wish you to understand this.

2040
02:19:43,020 --> 02:19:49,180
 For every DFT, there is something called resolution.

2041
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:53,140
 How precise your DFT spectrum is.

2042
02:19:53,140 --> 02:19:56,580
 We use the term resolution to quantify it.

2043
02:19:56,580 --> 02:19:59,620
 What is exactly the resolution of DFT?

2044
02:19:59,620 --> 02:20:04,100
 So the resolution of DFT depends on this guy.

2045
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:07,180
 It's actually the Ft divided by m.

2046
02:20:07,180 --> 02:20:08,460
 So two things.

2047
02:20:08,460 --> 02:20:10,460
 First one is how many points?

2048
02:20:10,460 --> 02:20:12,140
 This one, how many points?

2049
02:20:12,140 --> 02:20:15,580
 So the more points you have, the

2050
02:20:15,580 --> 02:20:18,660
 poorer resolution you have.

2051
02:20:18,820 --> 02:20:21,380
 What does this resolution describe?

2052
02:20:21,380 --> 02:20:25,020
 It describes one sample in the DFT spectrum.

2053
02:20:25,020 --> 02:20:28,460
 How much information it contains, basically.

2054
02:20:28,460 --> 02:20:29,740
 I'm putting the layman term.

2055
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:33,780
 So let's say I have eight points as my spectrum.

2056
02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:35,900
 What does one of the points represent?

2057
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:39,140
 Or how much information does this one point convey?

2058
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:41,020
 It's actually the minimal resolution.

2059
02:20:41,020 --> 02:20:42,700
 The more information it conveys, the

2060
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:44,460
 higher resolution it has.

2061
02:20:44,460 --> 02:20:46,940
 So if you think about a spectrum, if I sample using a

2062
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:51,780
 thousand points, every point only captures 1 over 1,000

2063
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:53,260
 portions of my information.

2064
02:20:53,260 --> 02:20:57,380
 So the larger the n, the fewer information I have.

2065
02:20:57,380 --> 02:21:00,580
 So that means the larger the n, the poorer resolution I will

2066
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:03,020
 have per measure, per point.

2067
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:06,900
 Makes sense?

2068
02:21:06,900 --> 02:21:07,900
 So this is one more factor.

2069
02:21:07,900 --> 02:21:13,140
 So n will determine partially the resolution.

2070
02:21:13,140 --> 02:21:14,260
 This is the first thing.

2071
02:21:14,260 --> 02:21:15,940
 The other thing is the Ft.

2072
02:21:15,940 --> 02:21:20,140
 Ft is the sampling frequency of the signal.

2073
02:21:20,140 --> 02:21:23,940
 So Ft has nothing to do with your DFT.

2074
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:27,900
 Ft only determined by the original discrete signal.

2075
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:31,700
 Remember, the input of DFT is already sampled.

2076
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:36,140
 I give you a signal that already determined the Ft.

2077
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:38,500
 So you can see that there are two things you can manipulate

2078
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:40,100
 the resolution.

2079
02:21:40,100 --> 02:21:42,620
 One is that how did you get this discrete signal, which is

2080
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:44,700
 before applying DFT.

2081
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:46,100
 But they're likely you cannot change it.

2082
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:48,820
 But the only thing you can change is the n.

2083
02:21:48,820 --> 02:21:53,980
 You can change the n to manipulate the resolution.

2084
02:21:53,980 --> 02:21:56,380
 But resolution depends on these two numbers.

2085
02:21:56,380 --> 02:22:00,500
 How fast do you sample the signal in the time domain?

2086
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:02,580
 How many points you use for DFT?

2087
02:22:02,580 --> 02:22:05,420
 These two numbers determine the resolution of your

2088
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:08,060
 discrete DFT spectrum.

2089
02:22:08,060 --> 02:22:11,980
 So visually, we all see that you can actually design the

2090
02:22:11,980 --> 02:22:14,820
 DFT to change the resolution.

2091
02:22:14,820 --> 02:22:15,740
 Zero padding.

2092
02:22:15,740 --> 02:22:18,300
 Later, we're going to see there.

2093
02:22:18,300 --> 02:22:20,300
 But this is a very important definition.

2094
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:22,699
 I may ask you in the homework in the exam.

2095
02:22:22,699 --> 02:22:24,660
 So make sure you understand what they are.

2096
02:22:24,660 --> 02:22:28,660
 It's a ratio, Ft divided by n.

2097
02:22:28,660 --> 02:22:30,220
 And how can you compute it?

2098
02:22:30,220 --> 02:22:33,220
 Well, for example, if I have a signal, which is sampled at

2099
02:22:33,220 --> 02:22:37,060
 8 kilohertz, what does this 8 mean?

2100
02:22:37,060 --> 02:22:40,900
 So 8,000 means Ft.

2101
02:22:40,900 --> 02:22:45,100
 Remember, Ft is how fast you sample the signal.

2102
02:22:45,100 --> 02:22:48,699
 So when you read this phrase, you should tell that this 8,000

2103
02:22:48,699 --> 02:22:50,300
 is actually the Ft.

2104
02:22:50,300 --> 02:22:53,060
 Sampling rate.

2105
02:22:53,060 --> 02:22:58,100
 Now I say that I apply a 1,024 point of DFT to

2106
02:22:58,100 --> 02:23:00,260
 represent this signal.

2107
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:01,500
 What does this number mean?

2108
02:23:05,420 --> 02:23:08,859
 What does 1,024 mean here?

2109
02:23:08,859 --> 02:23:10,539
 Is the n.

2110
02:23:10,980 --> 02:23:16,060
 So now I can use this number to derive the resolution.

2111
02:23:16,060 --> 02:23:20,820
 It's nothing but 8,000 divided by 1,000 over 24.

2112
02:23:20,820 --> 02:23:21,420
 By definition.

2113
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:24,820
 So to compute the resolution, you need two numbers.

2114
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:27,980
 First one is how fast or what's the sampling rate.

2115
02:23:27,980 --> 02:23:30,980
 The other one is how many points your DFT is.

2116
02:23:30,980 --> 02:23:32,940
 You get this two number, you just divide it, you get the

2117
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:35,020
 resolution.

2118
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:38,020
 But you have to identify what are these two numbers.

2119
02:23:38,020 --> 02:23:39,180
 You read it from the question.

2120
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:43,580
 You get those two numbers, you can compute the resolution.

2121
02:23:43,580 --> 02:23:44,740
 So this is one practice.

2122
02:23:44,740 --> 02:23:47,660
 But you can easily get it if you read the question

2123
02:23:47,660 --> 02:23:48,380
 carefully.

2124
02:23:48,380 --> 02:23:52,580
 Sampling rate, number of points for the DFT.

2125
02:23:52,580 --> 02:23:56,300
 So DFT is actually very commonly used because for most

2126
02:23:56,300 --> 02:23:58,780
 of the digital world, you have to do DFT.

2127
02:23:58,780 --> 02:24:01,260
 And also there's a faster version of DFT.

2128
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:03,740
 It's called FFT, fast Fourier transform.

2129
02:24:03,740 --> 02:24:08,660
 So I'm going to keep this for next week because I feel like

2130
02:24:08,660 --> 02:24:10,820
 the slides for this week is very brief.

2131
02:24:10,820 --> 02:24:13,500
 So I doubt you can get it, but I will prepare some more for

2132
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:14,140
 next week.

2133
02:24:14,140 --> 02:24:20,060
 But FFT is most likely how we use to implement DFT.

2134
02:24:20,060 --> 02:24:20,940
 Two reasons.

2135
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:22,260
 First one is faster.

2136
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:23,460
 By name, you can tell it's faster.

2137
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:27,619
 The other one is FFT is exactly equivalent to DFT.

2138
02:24:27,619 --> 02:24:28,940
 Not even approximation.

2139
02:24:28,940 --> 02:24:31,180
 It's exactly the same.

2140
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:31,940
 Which is amazing.

2141
02:24:31,940 --> 02:24:35,500
 So somebody even think this is one of the most important

2142
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:36,940
 invention for signal processing.

2143
02:24:36,940 --> 02:24:40,820
 But anyway, DFT is the equivalent to FFT.

2144
02:24:40,820 --> 02:24:42,540
 That's something you want to memorize.

2145
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:44,220
 And FFT is faster.

2146
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:46,940
 I think that's all you need.

2147
02:24:46,940 --> 02:24:50,900
 But theoretical repetition will always use DFT because

2148
02:24:50,900 --> 02:24:53,260
 DFT is more straightforward.

2149
02:24:53,260 --> 02:24:55,220
 In practice, people do FFT.

2150
02:24:55,220 --> 02:24:56,260
 But these two are the same.

2151
02:24:56,260 --> 02:24:59,180
 In terms of outcome, it's the same.

2152
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:02,460
 So this one, I already went through this one.

2153
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:04,660
 Basically, it's an illustration.

2154
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:10,140
 So I want you to give you a way to represent the DFT

2155
02:25:10,140 --> 02:25:12,140
 using matrix.

2156
02:25:12,140 --> 02:25:16,060
 So I just want to show you how many of you know when you

2157
02:25:16,060 --> 02:25:19,900
 represent a discrete transform, you can actually use a

2158
02:25:19,900 --> 02:25:23,180
 vector matrix form.

2159
02:25:23,180 --> 02:25:26,820
 Like for example, some of you told me that you have learned

2160
02:25:26,820 --> 02:25:27,900
 wavelets.

2161
02:25:27,900 --> 02:25:32,420
 So wavelets, you can actually use a matrix to represent

2162
02:25:32,420 --> 02:25:34,460
 the wavelets.

2163
02:25:34,460 --> 02:25:35,339
 Same for DFT.

2164
02:25:35,339 --> 02:25:37,740
 You can actually use a matrix to represent a DFT.

2165
02:25:41,300 --> 02:25:41,660
 Why?

2166
02:25:41,660 --> 02:25:47,380
 Because if you look at this form, my outcome, my output is

2167
02:25:47,380 --> 02:25:51,500
 actually an n-dimensional signal, n-point signal.

2168
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:53,580
 My input is also n-point signal.

2169
02:25:53,580 --> 02:25:56,939
 So if I want to relate n-point signal to the other n-point

2170
02:25:56,939 --> 02:26:00,460
 signal, I can use a square matrix to do it by simply

2171
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:04,060
 multiply the square matrix with my input signal.

2172
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:06,580
 It's a matrix vector multiplication.

2173
02:26:06,580 --> 02:26:10,660
 But the question is, how can I figure out this square matrix?

2174
02:26:10,660 --> 02:26:12,420
 So this is what I'm going to do.

2175
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:14,980
 You have to start with the fundamental equation here.

2176
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:19,500
 This is actually the definition of forward DFT.

2177
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:23,500
 But this DFT, the basis is very special.

2178
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:23,900
 Why?

2179
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:27,859
 Because the basis, the e to the power of minus j 2 pi k

2180
02:26:27,859 --> 02:26:33,300
 divided by n times n, is special because 2 pi divided by n,

2181
02:26:33,300 --> 02:26:34,820
 these are constant.

2182
02:26:34,820 --> 02:26:38,300
 The only two variables are k and n.

2183
02:26:38,300 --> 02:26:43,060
 So if I rewrite the e to the power of minus j 2 pi divided

2184
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:51,660
 by n, big n, we as w subscript n, I can represent this by

2185
02:26:51,660 --> 02:26:55,099
 this guy to the power of k n.

2186
02:26:55,099 --> 02:26:59,619
 Expansion, you're just writing special to a fixed base.

2187
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:04,580
 This w n is a fixed base, which equal to e to the power of

2188
02:27:04,580 --> 02:27:07,420
 j minus j 2 pi divided by n.

2189
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:08,980
 I just power it with k n.

2190
02:27:08,980 --> 02:27:12,500
 I give back to my original base.

2191
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:15,780
 Just for simplicity, I use a notation to represent a very

2192
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:17,980
 long exponential.

2193
02:27:17,980 --> 02:27:19,380
 But this w n is a constant.

2194
02:27:19,380 --> 02:27:20,460
 Only depends on n.

2195
02:27:20,460 --> 02:27:21,860
 I can write it as constant.

2196
02:27:21,860 --> 02:27:24,580
 So why this is interesting?

2197
02:27:24,580 --> 02:27:29,420
 Because the change of the k n, the k of n will be changed

2198
02:27:29,420 --> 02:27:31,220
 because it depends on which input and which output we are

2199
02:27:31,220 --> 02:27:31,980
 talking about.

2200
02:27:31,980 --> 02:27:32,580
 They will be changed.

2201
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:36,780
 But they are basically finding the sample point in this

2202
02:27:36,780 --> 02:27:38,460
 unit circle.

2203
02:27:38,460 --> 02:27:38,940
 Why?

2204
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:42,180
 Because this guy is actually a unit circle.

2205
02:27:42,180 --> 02:27:43,220
 What does that mean?

2206
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:47,460
 It's a circle in the complex plane where the length is

2207
02:27:47,460 --> 02:27:48,500
 always equal to 1.

2208
02:27:48,500 --> 02:27:50,780
 The magnitude is always equal to 1.

2209
02:27:50,780 --> 02:27:53,900
 The only thing change is the phase.

2210
02:27:53,900 --> 02:27:57,980
 So basically, the change of the phase will be a sample point

2211
02:27:57,980 --> 02:28:01,500
 on this unit circle uniformly.

2212
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:12,460
 In other words, if my w part of 1 will be here, 2 will be here,

2213
02:28:12,460 --> 02:28:12,939
 3 will be here.

2214
02:28:12,939 --> 02:28:18,220
 So it's going to be sampled around the unit circle.

2215
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:21,220
 And how many shares it has, it's going to depend on the

2216
02:28:21,220 --> 02:28:22,060
 subscript.

2217
02:28:22,060 --> 02:28:24,740
 If a is equal to 8, I have n points.

2218
02:28:24,740 --> 02:28:27,859
 So I have a point in this unit circle.

2219
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:32,420
 So the reason I'm doing this is I want to represent the

2220
02:28:32,420 --> 02:28:36,700
 DFT as a least of equations.

2221
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:38,140
 So why do I need a least of equation?

2222
02:28:38,140 --> 02:28:43,580
 Because the k and n must be changed from 0, 1, 2, 3, all

2223
02:28:43,580 --> 02:28:45,300
 the way to n minus 1.

2224
02:28:45,300 --> 02:28:48,980
 So by changing the value, I can write actually n number of

2225
02:28:48,980 --> 02:28:50,180
 equations.

2226
02:28:50,180 --> 02:28:54,540
 So the first equation is when k equals to 0, how can I

2227
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:59,100
 derive the xk, x0 from the DFT?

2228
02:28:59,100 --> 02:29:03,780
 So the first line is the DFT for k equal to 0.

2229
02:29:03,780 --> 02:29:05,300
 I'm just applying the formula.

2230
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:06,740
 This is my formula.

2231
02:29:06,740 --> 02:29:10,460
 I want to get my x0.

2232
02:29:10,460 --> 02:29:12,100
 I just expand the right-hand side.

2233
02:29:12,100 --> 02:29:14,580
 This is what I get here.

2234
02:29:14,580 --> 02:29:18,420
 And now this is k equal to 1 case, k equal to 2.

2235
02:29:18,420 --> 02:29:24,060
 So I'm going to end up with a linear system of n equations.

2236
02:29:24,100 --> 02:29:26,980
 And it depends how many points you have on DFT.

2237
02:29:26,980 --> 02:29:30,820
 So this is actually the n equation I need to come up

2238
02:29:30,820 --> 02:29:34,699
 with my discrete spectrum.

2239
02:29:34,699 --> 02:29:36,779
 But why do I want to write in this way?

2240
02:29:36,779 --> 02:29:40,260
 Because if I can write in this way, I do not have to write

2241
02:29:40,260 --> 02:29:41,460
 any equation every time.

2242
02:29:41,460 --> 02:29:46,019
 I can just write a single equation with a so-called

2243
02:29:46,019 --> 02:29:49,140
 DFT transformation as a matrix.

2244
02:29:49,140 --> 02:29:53,619
 So how many of you have learned how do you do matrix

2245
02:29:53,620 --> 02:29:56,420
 vector multiplication?

2246
02:29:56,420 --> 02:29:58,340
 Or how many of you do not know how to do matrix

2247
02:29:58,340 --> 02:29:59,900
 vector multiplication?

2248
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:02,140
 As a matrix, I multiply a vector.

2249
02:30:02,140 --> 02:30:03,540
 How to do the computation of this?

2250
02:30:03,540 --> 02:30:06,500
 How many of you do not know this?

2251
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:09,220
 I just want to know, does this make sense for everyone?

2252
02:30:09,220 --> 02:30:11,340
 I do a matrix multiplied by a vector.

2253
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:16,220
 I hope you know it right.

2254
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:18,860
 So if you do a matrix multiplied by a vector, what

2255
02:30:18,860 --> 02:30:22,220
 actually happens is that the first row of the matrix

2256
02:30:22,220 --> 02:30:26,699
 will multiply by the column and up with the first value.

2257
02:30:26,699 --> 02:30:28,820
 So this x0 is here.

2258
02:30:28,820 --> 02:30:30,900
 When I multiply the first row and this column,

2259
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:35,260
 it will be 1 times x0, 1 times x1, 1 times x2.

2260
02:30:35,260 --> 02:30:38,580
 So that's exactly the first equation.

2261
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:41,900
 Now the second element, x1, will be the second row

2262
02:30:41,900 --> 02:30:44,019
 multiplied by the same vector.

2263
02:30:44,019 --> 02:30:49,859
 I'm going to have x0 plus x1 times wn plus x2 times wn

2264
02:30:49,859 --> 02:30:50,539
 to power 2.

2265
02:30:50,540 --> 02:30:52,820
 So that's exactly the second equation.

2266
02:30:52,820 --> 02:30:58,580
 So I'm just rewrite my DFT with an equation,

2267
02:30:58,580 --> 02:31:01,940
 and it was one equation, but involve a matrix vector

2268
02:31:01,940 --> 02:31:04,700
 multiplication.

2269
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:05,340
 I didn't do anything.

2270
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:06,420
 It's the same.

2271
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:09,700
 It's the same, just equivalent representation.

2272
02:31:09,700 --> 02:31:15,340
 The reason we want to do this is because this guy, this wn,

2273
02:31:15,340 --> 02:31:19,420
 this is actually literally the DFT.

2274
02:31:19,420 --> 02:31:23,740
 A DFT can be represented nothing but the matrix.

2275
02:31:23,740 --> 02:31:25,460
 Next time you have another input signal,

2276
02:31:25,460 --> 02:31:27,540
 you just multiply it.

2277
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:29,740
 You will get another output.

2278
02:31:29,740 --> 02:31:33,100
 So basically what actually happened for transformation

2279
02:31:33,100 --> 02:31:37,420
 is a predefined matrix multiplied by a given signal

2280
02:31:37,420 --> 02:31:39,940
 to generate the output.

2281
02:31:39,940 --> 02:31:42,460
 So this is why we call the linear system,

2282
02:31:42,460 --> 02:31:43,820
 because it's linear.

2283
02:31:43,820 --> 02:31:45,340
 Just multiply a row or a column.

2284
02:31:45,340 --> 02:31:48,260
 That's why we call it linear system.

2285
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:50,220
 Make sure you, OK.

2286
02:31:50,220 --> 02:31:51,940
 I strongly encourage you to try this,

2287
02:31:51,940 --> 02:31:56,260
 because it comes from the formula here.

2288
02:31:56,260 --> 02:31:59,500
 The reason how I can go from here to this row

2289
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:03,940
 is by substitute k equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, all the way to n,

2290
02:32:03,940 --> 02:32:04,860
 n minus 1.

2291
02:32:04,860 --> 02:32:08,740
 And also using n equal to 0, 1, 2, all the way to n minus 1.

2292
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:10,220
 So I didn't do anything change.

2293
02:32:10,220 --> 02:32:16,060
 I just keep using this with different n and different k.

2294
02:32:16,060 --> 02:32:19,460
 And now I just rewrite n equation using the matrix vector

2295
02:32:19,460 --> 02:32:20,019
 form.

2296
02:32:20,019 --> 02:32:21,060
 So nothing changed.

2297
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:22,980
 I just make it a different form.

2298
02:32:22,980 --> 02:32:25,340
 You can give a try, but I wish you

2299
02:32:25,340 --> 02:32:27,779
 to be familiar with the matrix vector form,

2300
02:32:27,779 --> 02:32:32,539
 because what can you use that for many of the cases?

2301
02:32:32,539 --> 02:32:34,300
 Because it's actually cleaner.

2302
02:32:34,300 --> 02:32:37,460
 You just need one equation rather than n equations.

2303
02:32:37,460 --> 02:32:41,779
 But the size of the matrix will be n by n.

2304
02:32:41,779 --> 02:32:45,980
 If you have 8 points, the matrix will be 8 by 8.

2305
02:32:46,260 --> 02:32:48,660
 So it's always a square matrix for DFT.

2306
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:56,340
 So now we can see that all DFT can be represented as a matrix.

2307
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:59,260
 And this matrix is actually symmetric.

2308
02:32:59,260 --> 02:33:01,100
 If you observe it, it's actually symmetric.

2309
02:33:01,100 --> 02:33:02,939
 Why?

2310
02:33:02,939 --> 02:33:07,180
 Well, this row equal to this column, apparently,

2311
02:33:07,180 --> 02:33:08,859
 is always 1.

2312
02:33:08,859 --> 02:33:11,100
 This row equal to this column.

2313
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:13,900
 You can tell this is symmetric, because n and the k

2314
02:33:13,900 --> 02:33:15,660
 are symmetric.

2315
02:33:15,660 --> 02:33:17,820
 If you look at the formula, n and the k are actually

2316
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:18,740
 symmetric.

2317
02:33:18,740 --> 02:33:20,740
 If you swap them, it's the same.

2318
02:33:20,740 --> 02:33:22,140
 It doesn't make a change.

2319
02:33:22,140 --> 02:33:24,500
 Because n and k are symmetric, this matrix

2320
02:33:24,500 --> 02:33:25,380
 must be symmetric.

2321
02:33:28,020 --> 02:33:30,900
 So it's always a symmetric matrix and always square.

2322
02:33:30,900 --> 02:33:33,580
 And the base is always written like this.

2323
02:33:33,580 --> 02:33:36,140
 Only depends on how many points you have.

2324
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:38,859
 N points, the only difference is the denominator.

2325
02:33:38,859 --> 02:33:41,140
 It becomes n.

2326
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:44,300
 So if you can do that, you can actually

2327
02:33:44,300 --> 02:33:47,859
 use this to compute any DFT.

2328
02:33:47,859 --> 02:33:49,060
 I give you an input signal.

2329
02:33:49,060 --> 02:33:51,060
 I just write the signal as a vector.

2330
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:52,740
 I multiply the matrix to the vector.

2331
02:33:52,740 --> 02:33:54,779
 I get my output.

2332
02:33:54,779 --> 02:33:56,980
 So it's just a one line equation.

2333
02:33:56,980 --> 02:34:00,140
 And how to do inverse DFT?

2334
02:34:00,140 --> 02:34:01,460
 It's a matrix inverse.

2335
02:34:01,460 --> 02:34:03,900
 You just invert this matrix.

2336
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:06,779
 You will get your inverse DFT.

2337
02:34:06,779 --> 02:34:10,300
 So now you can see where the inverse transfer comes from.

2338
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:14,500
 It's by directly inverting the matrix.

2339
02:34:14,500 --> 02:34:17,380
 So now w is the forward transform.

2340
02:34:17,380 --> 02:34:20,539
 W inverse is the inverse transform.

2341
02:34:20,539 --> 02:34:23,820
 So you can actually do it.

2342
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:27,740
 And technically, it should be Hermitian transpose.

2343
02:34:27,740 --> 02:34:29,859
 Because this is a symmetric transform,

2344
02:34:29,859 --> 02:34:31,500
 the inverse will be the Hermitian.

2345
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:35,660
 Hermitian means flip them and take the complex conjugate.

2346
02:34:35,660 --> 02:34:37,900
 But if it's a real number, then it doesn't matter.

2347
02:34:37,900 --> 02:34:38,859
 I mean, it's not a real number.

2348
02:34:38,860 --> 02:34:41,740
 You have to take complex conjugate of it.

2349
02:34:41,740 --> 02:34:45,300
 So for some simple value of the DFT,

2350
02:34:45,300 --> 02:34:47,580
 you can actually compute it yourself.

2351
02:34:47,580 --> 02:34:51,340
 For example, if I'm talking about a 2 by 2 DFT,

2352
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:54,140
 this is my 2 by 2 DFT.

2353
02:34:54,140 --> 02:34:58,460
 So if it's 2 by 2 DFT, I can simply compute the inverse,

2354
02:34:58,460 --> 02:35:02,300
 which is actually the complex conjugate, which is itself.

2355
02:35:02,300 --> 02:35:06,020
 If it's a 4 by 4 matrix, you can also

2356
02:35:06,020 --> 02:35:09,540
 compute the complex conjugate.

2357
02:35:09,540 --> 02:35:13,620
 You just need to make it symmetric and take whatever

2358
02:35:13,620 --> 02:35:15,580
 j becomes minus j.

2359
02:35:15,580 --> 02:35:17,380
 So this is how you can do a complex conjugate.

2360
02:35:17,380 --> 02:35:19,180
 And you can compute, for example, what

2361
02:35:19,180 --> 02:35:21,620
 is the DFT of this signal?

2362
02:35:21,620 --> 02:35:25,420
 You just multiply my 4 by 4 DFT with the signal.

2363
02:35:25,420 --> 02:35:26,860
 This is with the output.

2364
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:31,660
 So this x will be the corresponding 4 point DFT

2365
02:35:31,660 --> 02:35:36,300
 spectrum of the 4 point signal in the beginning.

2366
02:35:36,300 --> 02:35:38,580
 So like I mentioned, it's equivalent.

2367
02:35:38,580 --> 02:35:40,619
 But having this matrix vector form

2368
02:35:40,619 --> 02:35:43,860
 will make the entire representation cleaner.

2369
02:35:43,860 --> 02:35:48,260
 When you write it, it's just one line instead of n lines.

2370
02:35:48,260 --> 02:35:51,900
 But in practical, it's equivalent.

2371
02:35:51,900 --> 02:35:54,020
 So I will skip the FFT to next week.

2372
02:35:54,020 --> 02:35:57,580
 But one last topic, I probably won't give you an exam,

2373
02:35:57,580 --> 02:35:59,180
 but just for your knowledge.

2374
02:35:59,180 --> 02:36:03,220
 So in many applications, especially involving

2375
02:36:03,220 --> 02:36:07,420
 this time series, like acoustic signal, LLP,

2376
02:36:07,420 --> 02:36:10,500
 you will not have finite length signal.

2377
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:14,140
 Remember, DFT can only deal with finite length signal.

2378
02:36:14,140 --> 02:36:16,100
 But if your signal is keep coming,

2379
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:19,980
 how can you figure out the spectrum, especially your signal

2380
02:36:19,980 --> 02:36:21,580
 is actually time varying?

2381
02:36:21,580 --> 02:36:24,300
 A common thing people do is so-called short time

2382
02:36:24,300 --> 02:36:25,660
 Fourier transform.

2383
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:27,420
 So what the short time Fourier transform means

2384
02:36:27,420 --> 02:36:31,380
 is nothing but just truncate the signal, divide them

2385
02:36:31,380 --> 02:36:35,900
 into n point segments, and doing a segment-wise DFT.

2386
02:36:35,900 --> 02:36:36,460
 It's very simple.

2387
02:36:36,460 --> 02:36:39,420
 But your n is a multi-segment spectrum.

2388
02:36:39,420 --> 02:36:41,180
 But this multi-segment spectrum will

2389
02:36:41,180 --> 02:36:42,540
 be a function of time.

2390
02:36:42,540 --> 02:36:44,020
 And it can keep change.

2391
02:36:44,020 --> 02:36:46,860
 This is actually how you visualize music,

2392
02:36:46,860 --> 02:36:49,180
 visualize your acoustic signal as the waveform.

2393
02:36:49,180 --> 02:36:51,460
 This is that they're doing nothing but a short time

2394
02:36:51,460 --> 02:36:53,820
 discrete Fourier transform.

2395
02:36:53,820 --> 02:36:55,580
 But I won't test it on this, but I just

2396
02:36:55,580 --> 02:36:57,340
 want to make sure that how can you

2397
02:36:57,340 --> 02:37:01,060
 apply a limited length transform to deal with time

2398
02:37:01,060 --> 02:37:04,460
 varying sequential signals in practice.

2399
02:37:04,460 --> 02:37:08,140
 You can do a short time DFT.

2400
02:37:08,140 --> 02:37:11,860
 So fast Fourier transform, I will leave this for next week.

2401
02:37:11,860 --> 02:37:13,860
 I don't have time, but I will give you some details.

2402
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:15,820
 But just one takeaway.

2403
02:37:15,820 --> 02:37:18,820
 I will get back to this next week.

2404
02:37:18,820 --> 02:37:20,300
 One takeaway is the efficiency.

2405
02:37:20,300 --> 02:37:23,340
 Why people like to do this fast Fourier transform

2406
02:37:23,340 --> 02:37:24,820
 is because it's fast.

2407
02:37:24,820 --> 02:37:26,580
 By name, you can tell it's fast.

2408
02:37:26,580 --> 02:37:29,500
 And it actually happens.

2409
02:37:29,500 --> 02:37:33,500
 It's actually fast, especially when the number of signal

2410
02:37:33,500 --> 02:37:36,260
 becomes high-dimensional.

2411
02:37:36,260 --> 02:37:38,619
 So this is the plot.

2412
02:37:38,619 --> 02:37:42,820
 When the n increase, you can tell that the runtime,

2413
02:37:42,820 --> 02:37:48,699
 or the complexity of DFT increase as a part of 2.

2414
02:37:48,699 --> 02:37:51,140
 But FFT will give you n times log n.

2415
02:37:51,140 --> 02:37:55,859
 So FFT will be much more scalable than DFT,

2416
02:37:55,859 --> 02:37:58,820
 especially when you deal with large-scale signal.

2417
02:37:58,820 --> 02:38:01,460
 Small-scale signal doesn't be too different,

2418
02:38:01,460 --> 02:38:03,820
 but large-scale is a big difference.

2419
02:38:03,820 --> 02:38:07,260
 And that's why in practice, always people do FFT, not DFT.

2420
02:38:07,260 --> 02:38:10,619
 But analyzing you always do DFT is simpler.

2421
02:38:10,619 --> 02:38:12,140
 So this is the only fair issue to know.

2422
02:38:12,140 --> 02:38:14,060
 Other derivation, I won't test you,

2423
02:38:14,060 --> 02:38:17,420
 but I will tell you more next week.

2424
02:38:17,420 --> 02:38:21,100
 So yeah, so FFT, basically, you just

2425
02:38:21,100 --> 02:38:23,980
 need to know this, the operation.

2426
02:38:23,980 --> 02:38:28,340
 DFT, n squared, FFT, n times log n.

2427
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:31,580
 OK, I believe all of you know how to analyze.

2428
02:38:31,580 --> 02:38:33,860
 n squared will be more expensive than n log n,

2429
02:38:33,860 --> 02:38:37,540
 because n linear function increase much faster

2430
02:38:37,540 --> 02:38:38,620
 than log function.

2431
02:38:38,620 --> 02:38:42,380
 All of you in log function will be slower than linear function.

2432
02:38:42,380 --> 02:38:45,300
 So this is the common sense.

2433
02:38:45,300 --> 02:38:49,019
 So basically, that's the only thing you need to know.

2434
02:38:49,019 --> 02:38:51,019
 OK, one last slide.

2435
02:38:51,019 --> 02:38:52,699
 Zero padding.

2436
02:38:52,699 --> 02:38:54,980
 Zero padding is a common trick people

2437
02:38:54,980 --> 02:38:58,060
 use to increase resolution.

2438
02:38:58,060 --> 02:38:59,779
 Remember just now I say, for DFT,

2439
02:38:59,779 --> 02:39:01,779
 there's a concept called resolution.

2440
02:39:01,779 --> 02:39:05,539
 Two things, sampling frequency divided by the n.

2441
02:39:05,539 --> 02:39:07,939
 When I give you a signal, you have

2442
02:39:07,939 --> 02:39:09,460
 no way to change the sampling rate,

2443
02:39:09,460 --> 02:39:11,420
 because it's already sampled.

2444
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:14,660
 The only thing you can change to increase the resolution

2445
02:39:14,660 --> 02:39:17,460
 is by changing the n.

2446
02:39:17,460 --> 02:39:19,860
 How many points you do DFT?

2447
02:39:19,860 --> 02:39:22,539
 Suppose I give you a point signal.

2448
02:39:22,539 --> 02:39:27,340
 How can you make the n larger to apply DFT?

2449
02:39:27,340 --> 02:39:29,460
 The only way you do is adding zero.

2450
02:39:29,460 --> 02:39:31,580
 You can add zero to the signal to make it more.

2451
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:35,500
 For example, if this is my original signal,

2452
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:37,580
 let's say 16 points.

2453
02:39:37,580 --> 02:39:39,460
 If I don't add zero, I have no choice.

2454
02:39:39,460 --> 02:39:42,500
 I have to do 16 point DFT.

2455
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:48,660
 So I'm going to end up with a spectrum like this.

2456
02:39:48,660 --> 02:39:52,340
 So of course, the spectrum will be still 16 point.

2457
02:39:52,340 --> 02:39:56,900
 So my resolution will be FS divided by 16.

2458
02:39:56,900 --> 02:40:00,260
 But if I want to have a higher resolution signal,

2459
02:40:00,260 --> 02:40:02,540
 so what I can do is I still keep the waveform,

2460
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:04,940
 but I add zero to it.

2461
02:40:04,940 --> 02:40:07,340
 You can see all of these zero are added.

2462
02:40:07,340 --> 02:40:09,580
 While at zero, I didn't give any new information.

2463
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:10,900
 It's the same information.

2464
02:40:10,900 --> 02:40:13,940
 But I changed my resolution.

2465
02:40:13,940 --> 02:40:15,779
 So when I change my resolution, you end up

2466
02:40:15,779 --> 02:40:18,980
 with a spectrum that's still the same waveform,

2467
02:40:18,980 --> 02:40:21,619
 but the samples are more dense.

2468
02:40:21,619 --> 02:40:24,260
 You are making the sample dense.

2469
02:40:24,260 --> 02:40:26,340
 So this is the only way you can change the resolution

2470
02:40:26,340 --> 02:40:29,740
 if I already give the sample signal to you.

2471
02:40:29,740 --> 02:40:31,300
 You have previous to n.

2472
02:40:31,300 --> 02:40:33,180
 But FS, you cannot change it.

2473
02:40:33,180 --> 02:40:35,619
 So this is basically a common trick in the exam

2474
02:40:35,619 --> 02:40:38,460
 if I tell you, say, what can you do to change the resolution?

2475
02:40:38,460 --> 02:40:40,420
 Answer is always zero padding.

2476
02:40:40,420 --> 02:40:42,540
 And this is how you can do it.

2477
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:43,820
 So you can go through it.

2478
02:40:43,820 --> 02:40:47,500
 But I think zero padding is nothing but just

2479
02:40:47,500 --> 02:40:49,300
 increase the change the resolution.

2480
02:40:49,300 --> 02:40:51,540
 Nothing's too important.

2481
02:40:51,540 --> 02:40:53,380
 OK, so that's all I want to cover for today.

2482
02:40:53,380 --> 02:40:54,460
 I think I'm just on time.

2483
02:40:54,460 --> 02:40:57,900
 And basically, for today, two things.

2484
02:40:57,900 --> 02:40:58,620
 Adasing.

2485
02:40:58,620 --> 02:41:01,060
 You must know how to get adasing, where it come from,

2486
02:41:01,060 --> 02:41:02,980
 and how to avoid it.

2487
02:41:02,980 --> 02:41:06,940
 Micro-sumpling condition.

2488
02:41:06,940 --> 02:41:08,340
 And then we learn the three things.

2489
02:41:08,340 --> 02:41:10,020
 CTFT, DTFT, and DFT.

2490
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:11,260
 Know the difference.

2491
02:41:11,260 --> 02:41:12,580
 Know how they are related.

2492
02:41:12,580 --> 02:41:15,060
 And know how to apply DFT to arbitrary signals.

2493
02:41:15,060 --> 02:41:18,420
 These are something you need to know.

2494
02:41:18,420 --> 02:41:20,460
 OK, so that's all for today.

2495
02:41:20,460 --> 02:41:22,140
 If you have questions, I can take questions.

2496
02:41:22,140 --> 02:41:23,620
 Otherwise, feel free to go.

2497
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:24,940
 So I see you next week.

2498
02:41:24,940 --> 02:41:26,060
 Same time and same place.

2499
02:41:26,060 --> 02:41:27,580
 Thank you.
