1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
All right, OK, let me know if it's too dim, right?

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,000
Because I tried to turn it on.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,600
But it's like too bright to me, and people cannot see the

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,640
monitor, I think, I feel.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,880
OK.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,960
All right, so maybe we can start.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,600
And I think I can, like usual, I can finish everything by

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,040
nine, so you guys can leave earlier, right?

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,120
And this is actually our last lecture.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,840
And next week will be recess week.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
I hope all of you know that we have no class next week.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,000
But we do need you to work on the homework.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,600
All right, so don't forget the homework.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,920
And actually, by the end of today, you should know all of

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,120
the knowledge, concept, which you need for the homework.

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,800
All right, so I think there's one question that needs the

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,640
topic for today.

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,540
But after that, you should have all of the information.

19
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,480
So do try those questions.

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,800
And I do receive some kind of concerns or questions that

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,920
regarding those homework.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
So as you see that I did make some change to the homework

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,120
for this time, comparing to last year.

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,680
So please stick to the version this year, right?

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,320
Because I removed some questions from last year.

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,160
And you don't have to do it, all right?

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,360
So stick to the version I uploaded recently, OK?

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,600
And all of you know that the deadline will be the end of

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,360
recess week, right?

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,920
So don't miss the deadline.

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,680
All right, so without further ado, let's proceed to today's

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,400
topic.

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,720
So pretty much starting from last week, we're focusing on

34
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,560
the applications that we can use, the multi-rate processing

35
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,920
that we learned before.

36
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,920
And we say that, I think we covered the first two topics

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,680
last week, including how can we design the fractional

38
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,440
amount of phase shifter, right?

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,520
Basically, if you want to do some rate change, but they're

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,480
not integer amount of change, you can actually use one kind

41
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,280
of up sampler followed by another down sampler to

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,400
realize those fractional change.

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,560
And also, we talk about filter banks, in which you want to do

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,120
different kind of processing for different kind of

45
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,960
spectrum, right?

46
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,800
Which is quite common for signal processing.

47
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,840
And we say that you can come up with some analysis filter

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,880
bank, and then followed by some processing.

49
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,920
And then you do a synthesis process to reconstruct the

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,360
original signal, all right?

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,520
So we're going to do a quick review and recap on those two

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,280
things.

53
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,480
And after that, we're going to proceed to the last topic,

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,280
which is the QMF, right?

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,600
So QMF stands for the quadrature mirror filters, which

56
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,920
is some kind of a realistic way in which you can use

57
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,920
non-ideal low-pass filter to also achieve some kind of

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,160
perfect reconstruction.

59
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,000
So if you remember, we talk about in the filter bank that

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,080
if we use ideal low-pass filter, you can perfectly

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,800
separate the spectrums into different kind of bands that

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,960
you want to process them accordingly.

63
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,880
But all of this band-pass filter, low-pass filter are

64
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,600
ideal.

65
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,480
In other words, you don't see any transition from the pass

66
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,840
band to the stop band, right?

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,560
But we say that we don't have such kind of ideal low-pass

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,840
filter in practice.

69
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,640
What happens if we still want to do perfect reconstruction?

70
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,160
So the QMF is one thing you can do smartly to use those

71
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,360
non-ideal filter as still without getting to the aliasing

72
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,040
problems, right?

73
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,360
So we're going to see how we can do them.

74
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,920
So here's a recap on what we talked about last week.

75
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,520
So we talked about this fractional phase shifter,

76
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,160
which means if you want to do some kind of a rate change,

77
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,520
but this rate change can be only represented as a

78
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,560
fractional number, right?

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,160
Something like k over i, in which case both k and i are

80
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,120
integers, and they are relatively

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,600
prime positive integers.

82
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,960
In other words, no common factors, right?

83
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,320
So if you want to do so, it's hard to use one upsampler or

84
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,760
downsampler to do it.

85
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,120
But in practice, you can do two, right?

86
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,800
You can first apply an upsampler, followed by a

87
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,400
low-pass filter, and then another downsampler to do it.

88
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,920
But you have to make sure the ratio here are actually

89
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,000
corresponding weight, right?

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,040
You are going to do the corresponding ratios.

91
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
So that's actually something we covered in the first part.

92
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,880
And then we see that, well, we can use the multi-weight

93
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,280
processing to implement a filter bank.

94
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,960
So basically, if we are talking about ideal low-pass

95
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,400
filter or band-pass filter, the most common way we use

96
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080
filter banks is to separate the spectrum into different

97
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,440
kind of sections.

98
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,960
And of course, this section will be like

99
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,400
orthogonal to each other.

100
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,480
So one possible way is that we want to kind of segment the

101
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,480
frequency entire range into uniformly, let's say, n

102
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,160
different kind of sections, right?

103
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,800
So every section cover a range of frequency spectrums, and

104
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,520
you believe that they have different characteristics, and

105
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,720
you want to process them differently.

106
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,440
So in this case, your low-pass filter or band-pass filter

107
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,000
will be in the following way, right?

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,320
So here, the K stands for the K channel, right?

109
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,320
So basically, we are shifting the low-pass filter to the

110
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,640
corresponding specific bandwidth, right?

111
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,080
So in this case, we call the H0 as the prototype, which

112
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,560
itself is a low-pass filter, right?

113
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,040
So the others will be just shifted

114
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,000
to the conversion of the prototype.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,320
And in this case, we can also work out the time domain

116
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,520
representation for all of these HKs.

117
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,240
So this is actually your frequency domain.

118
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,280
Okay, let me use a pointer, right?

119
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,160
So this is actually your frequency domain representation

120
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,000
of the shifting.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,240
So it's going to be a shift in the omega domain, right?

122
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,240
So we say that the shift in the frequency domain will be

123
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,880
correspondingly a phase change in the time domain, right?

124
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,360
This is due to the DTFT property, all right?

125
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,240
So the change from the H0 to HK in the time domain will be

126
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,480
a multiplication of the E2 power of a phase shift, right?

127
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,440
Of course, this phase shift will be completely depends

128
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,280
on the K, right?

129
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,840
So the different K is going to be proportionally change

130
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,560
the phase, right, the amount of phase shift.

131
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,280
So again, this H0 is called a prototype, but it's going to

132
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,000
be an impulse response of the prototype, all right?

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,960
So once you have this H0 specified, you can derive all of

134
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,320
the other band-pass filter, right?

135
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,480
So this is actually the idea.

136
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,720
You only need to give the prototype, and you should be able

137
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,760
to derive all of this HK, either in the frequency domain

138
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,200
or in the time domain, right?

139
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,080
This is something you need to know, and these two formulas

140
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,120
perfectly give you the idea how to do it, all right?

141
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,920
So, and we say that, well, when we implement these filter

142
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,240
bands, right, so in general, there are two stages.

143
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,280
So every time when you trying to decompose the spectrum

144
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,280
into, let's say, N different sections, the decomposition

145
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,960
of the representation is called the analysis filter, right?

146
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,840
So what is this analysis filter?

147
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,000
The analysis filter will be able to represent the signal

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,080
in the corresponding frequency range, all right?

149
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,600
That's the purpose of analysis filter.

150
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
So if you look at all of this X0, X1, all the way to XM-1,

151
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,200
these are down-sampled version of the signal

152
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,480
in the corresponding frequency range, all right?

153
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,480
That's what the band pass filter is doing.

154
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,360
And then if you look at every branch, what they are doing

155
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,280
here is actually, first, you apply some kind of a phase

156
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,200
shift, remember, this phase shift coming from here, right?

157
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,960
Because the case channel will have the corresponding

158
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,240
phase shift, right?

159
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,440
So in this case, every channel, the phase shift

160
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,960
will be different, okay?

161
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
Here, it's going to be zero channel, first channel,

162
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,480
all the way to M-1 channel, right?

163
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,880
And followed by the prototype filter.

164
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,920
So after the phase shift, this will be always the prototype.

165
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,320
So here, the H0 are the same.

166
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,080
If you combine the two, it's going to give you the H0,

167
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,120
H1, H2, and all the way HM-1.

168
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,800
So together, these two is the corresponding band pass

169
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,760
or low pass filter, right?

170
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,440
And after that, we say that since we only capture

171
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,520
a small range of the spectrum, so one can actually

172
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,520
down-sample the signal such that you can process

173
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,920
the signal in a much lower rate, okay?

174
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,360
If you don't do this, you can still process the signal,

175
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,300
but we're talking about a very narrow band signal

176
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,240
and in relatively high frequency, sorry, high rate.

177
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,420
So you actually waste a lot of computational resource, right?

178
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,160
So it's not saying you cannot do it, but it's less efficient

179
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,080
if you don't do the down-sampling, right?

180
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,680
Remember, when we do down-sampling, normally you have

181
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,400
to kind of stretch the spectrum, right?

182
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,640
So if your spectrum itself is very narrow,

183
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,120
it's perfectly fine to do it,

184
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,000
and you won't have any aliasing, remember?

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,720
So this thing before that is some kind of anti-aliasing

186
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,680
filter, right, if you view this from the decimation process.

187
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,000
All right, it's because that we already separated

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,820
the spectrum into different sections.

189
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,320
So naturally, the signal here, here, and here,

190
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,720
these are already band-limited.

191
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,920
So it's okay for you to directly do down-sampling, right?

192
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,720
And you should be aliasing-free if this D is actually

193
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,000
some number that proportional to this number of channels.

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,080
I mean, your D cannot be too large, of course, all right?

195
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,480
So this is actually the analysis process.

196
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,760
Now, after you do whatever you want,

197
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,840
so basically from this XK to the Y here,

198
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,680
this process is the processing you are doing

199
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,480
for that specific frequency range, right?

200
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,560
You can do different processing,

201
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,960
but basically the processing will make the X

202
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,940
change that into Y, right?

203
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,440
So for every channel, you can do specific processing

204
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,160
to whatever you wanna realize, and after that,

205
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,480
you should be able to recover the original signal, right?

206
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
So this synthesis process is like merging different

207
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,760
kind of sections of the spectrum into one, all right?

208
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,080
So this is what the synthesis filter band is doing.

209
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,360
So how they do it?

210
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,160
Well, you have to first convert the rate

211
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,720
back to the original rate, right?

212
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,280
So here, the down sampling D is always coupled

213
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,440
with this up sampling D, all right?

214
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,040
It's always the same, otherwise you go to different rate.

215
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,860
Okay, and followed by that, remember,

216
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,340
just like the way we do interpolation, right?

217
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,840
When you do interpolation, you have to have

218
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,920
another low-pass filter after it.

219
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,560
So similarly, here is the same thing.

220
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,420
You need to have another G followed by the phase shift

221
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,880
to get it back to the original kind of position, right?

222
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,620
So this is some kind of, if you view that

223
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,040
from the interpolation perspective,

224
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,800
this is actually a low-pass filter,

225
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,660
which is something like the reconstruction filter, right?

226
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,880
But then if you view the role of this filtering,

227
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,040
it's going to shift that kind of signal

228
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,720
back to the corresponding location.

229
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,360
Remember, all of these channels are only covering

230
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,280
a specific range, right, just like a band-pass filter.

231
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
So once you process that, you have to move it back

232
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,600
to the corresponding location in the spectrum

233
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,320
and then merge them together.

234
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,480
So all of this phase shift here will be

235
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,700
one-to-one corresponding to the phase shift here.

236
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,140
So they must be matched, all right, to move them,

237
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,060
to shift them back to the corresponding location.

238
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,580
Otherwise, if you sum them up,

239
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,600
it's going to overwrite each other, all right?

240
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,900
So this phase shift is actually necessary.

241
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,220
And then followed by that is just a summation, right?

242
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,940
Just combine everything together.

243
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,820
So by using this kind of filter band, right,

244
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,820
if you design correctly, and suppose you don't do anything

245
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,340
from X to Y, the entire process is doing nothing, right?

246
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,800
Basically, you should be able to get back

247
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,160
to your original signal without any change, okay?

248
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,320
So that's actually a qualified filter band, okay?

249
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,380
If you somehow introduced artifacts,

250
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,040
that's a non-ideal design, right?

251
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,080
You may have some problems.

252
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,560
Maybe your D is too large, which sometimes happens, right?

253
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,680
But what I'm saying is that a perfect filter band

254
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,720
with all of these conditions satisfy,

255
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,700
and if you directly put the Y equal to X, okay,

256
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,120
means you did not process anything in the middle,

257
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,540
the whole process should be identical.

258
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,260
What you have in the input will be the same as your output,

259
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,660
right, this is actually the purpose of the filter band,

260
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,700
right, making sure the spectrums themselves

261
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,780
are orthogonal to each other, right?

262
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,840
This is actually the, but of course, in practice,

263
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,300
we do add some processing between X and Y, right?

264
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,700
Just like the way we process different spectrums

265
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,940
in different ways, right?

266
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,980
All right, so important thing is that here,

267
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,820
you need to increase the sampling rate

268
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,020
to recover the original rate.

269
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,140
So this D must match with the analysis filter, right?

270
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,860
They are the same upsampling, and this filter,

271
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,620
sorry, this kind of shifter, sorry, phase shift

272
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,500
will be correspondingly shift the baseband output

273
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,840
to the bandpass output specifically, right?

274
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,960
Every channel the shift is corresponding

275
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,540
to the shift you did before in analysis filter band, right?

276
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,300
So this is how the entire process looks like, okay?

277
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,800
So I wish you, everybody can kind of understand the process,

278
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,040
and also, you should do two things.

279
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,920
First one is in the block diagram,

280
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,840
you should know how to do them, right?

281
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,200
How to, let's say if I give you a specific

282
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,320
downsampling rate, I give you a specific number of channels,

283
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,640
you should be able to draw the block diagram,

284
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,000
and also, you should be able to write the analytical form,

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,560
right, how can you generate the final output

286
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,520
using a bunch of Y and the G, right?

287
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,520
So both the block diagram and the analytical form

288
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,700
are needed, you have to know how to do it, all right?

289
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,200
Okay, so I hope I already make it very clear, right?

290
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,960
Which means you may see some questions, okay?

291
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,680
So you better make sure you are familiar

292
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,280
with most of the formulations, okay?

293
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,800
I will probably not test you on the

294
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,000
so-called simplified version.

295
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,400
Remember last time we said that you can actually use

296
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,700
a DFT followed by FFT to speed it up.

297
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,660
I won't test you on that, because that's,

298
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,960
but you know that they can be speed up, all right?

299
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,400
You are able to speed up the whole filter bank

300
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,600
using FFT, but I will not ask you to write it down, right?

301
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,560
How can you do FFT, that's kind of too much, all right?

302
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,440
But these form, analytical form,

303
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,200
and also the block diagram, I need you to know, okay?

304
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,180
All right?

305
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,120
Okay, so any question before I move on to the QMF today?

306
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,940
Okay, great.

307
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,560
So we have one last topic that we left out last week,

308
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,960
which is also quite important,

309
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,720
which are talking about the realistic,

310
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,080
how do I say, practical cases, right?

311
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,140
So all of this, if you remember,

312
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,940
all of this filter bank idea, right?

313
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,760
All of this G and all of this H,

314
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,720
we say they are ideal low-pass filter, right?

315
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,160
So that's why you can have something like this, right?

316
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,240
So this kind of sharp transition always happen in the,

317
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,360
in practice, sorry, always not possible in practice,

318
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,960
or impossible in practice.

319
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,960
So, but we want to enjoy this kind of merits of filter bank

320
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,080
and we want to implement them in practice.

321
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,160
So the question is that if we don't have

322
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,340
these kind of ideal low-pass filter or band-pass filter,

323
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,580
how can we still construct some kind of filter bank

324
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,360
to perform like a spectrum-specific processing, right?

325
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,380
So we, I mean, people have come up with different methods

326
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,680
to kind of overcome the practical challenges

327
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,840
of using non-ideal filters.

328
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,640
So this QMF is one of the method, okay?

329
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,280
Not all, but one of the methods.

330
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,720
So these ideas called quadrature mirroring filter, okay?

331
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,480
So I will explain what does that mean, all right?

332
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,480
So basically you need to know, how should I say, two things.

333
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,720
First one is what does QMM trying to achieve?

334
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,180
Okay, why are we doing this?

335
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,220
The purpose of doing the QMF.

336
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,820
That's one thing I wish you to know.

337
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,640
The other thing is what kind of filter

338
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,240
will satisfy the condition of QMF?

339
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,320
Okay, so in other words, if I call this bunch of filter

340
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,760
R QMF, what do I mean, right?

341
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,440
So there must be some requirement or condition

342
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,600
that qualify a set of filter to be QMF.

343
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,760
So you need to know what they are, all right?

344
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,800
So these two things are something I mean,

345
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,020
I wish you to know, okay?

346
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,020
So first of all, let's consider that in practice, right?

347
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,760
So we just show that multirate filters

348
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,720
are very important, right?

349
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,600
We talk about computational aspect,

350
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,240
we can save the computational resource

351
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,640
if you go to lower rate.

352
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,720
We talk about filter banks,

353
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,520
which we can process every spectrum specifically.

354
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,280
But in practice, due to the non-idealness of the filter,

355
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
there's always aliasing.

356
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,960
And there'll be some kind of artifacts resulting

357
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,920
from this decimation or interpolation process, right?

358
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,560
And we want to make them, you know, minimize.

359
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,120
We want to suppress all of these artifacts, right?

360
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,080
So the question is like, how can we suppress this aliasing

361
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,100
even if we are using the non-ideal low-pass filter?

362
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,720
So once you're non-ideal, I'm talking about

363
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,440
a low-pass filter that looks like this.

364
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,880
In other words, from the passband to the stopband,

365
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,680
there is a transition period, okay?

366
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,000
The difference is that it's not like

367
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,600
vertical line directly goes down, right?

368
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,420
You are going to take some time to change

369
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,760
from the passband to the stopband, right?

370
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,980
This is what we mean by practical filters, okay?

371
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,060
So now, how can we come up with a practical solution

372
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,160
to solve the aliasing problem

373
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,980
by still utilizing the non-ideal filter, okay?

374
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,260
This is the approach.

375
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,060
I mean, one of the methods is called QMF, right?

376
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,500
It's called the quadrature mirror filters, QMF, okay?

377
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,940
So the basic building block of the QMF will be two channels.

378
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,340
They can be generalized to more channels,

379
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,860
but let's start by two channels.

380
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,260
In other words, we are talking about two branch,

381
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,060
like one filter cover half of the spectrum.

382
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,740
Remember, we say that filter band, you have n channels.

383
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,300
But here, let's simplify the thing first.

384
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,500
Let's talk about two channels, okay?

385
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,980
So if it's in two channel, right,

386
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,140
we are talking about, let's say, one passband filter,

387
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,140
sorry, one low-pass filter.

388
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,100
The other one will be the high-pass filter

389
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,820
because that's the only way the two can cover

390
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,500
the entire spectrum, right?

391
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,140
So here, you are going to have like two channels,

392
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,140
sorry, two filters covering the organo kind of spectrums.

393
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:29,060
And suppose we have the X0 and X1

394
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,940
to be the low-pass filter in the analysis filter band.

395
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,900
All right, so remember, there are two stages, right?

396
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,160
Analysis, synthesis.

397
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,740
So now let's imagine that the low-pass filter

398
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,260
that we use in the analysis are H0 and H1, right?

399
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,780
And of course, there will be two, you need another two,

400
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,420
correspondingly as the low-pass and high-pass

401
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,100
in the synthesis stage.

402
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,260
Let's call them G0 and G1, all right?

403
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,260
So as we described previously for the filter band, right,

404
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,240
you will have this kind of structure

405
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,380
where the signal well goes into each of the channel.

406
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,700
You first need some kind of a low-pass or high-pass,

407
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,980
followed by a down sampling.

408
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,140
Let's think about two, right?

409
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,460
I mean, don't make it too aggressive, but two.

410
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,660
And then process somehow, let's just skip that, right?

411
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,360
So like I mentioned, if you skip the processing,

412
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,980
you should, I mean, a good or perfect filter band

413
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,020
should be able to recover the original signal, right?

414
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,860
So let's do this.

415
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,580
Let's first assume that nothing happens

416
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,020
in the average channel, right?

417
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,720
Then after that, you need to directly perform

418
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,580
the interpolation, and the second stage

419
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,500
is called the synthesis stage, all right?

420
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,380
So this is like just the simplified version

421
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,000
of the filter band we talk about, only with two channels.

422
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,820
All right, but the difference is that here

423
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,980
the H and the G are no longer ideal, right?

424
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,820
We're talking about non-ideal filter, okay?

425
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,460
So let's think about, right,

426
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,860
if this is the filter band, what we have, right?

427
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,000
Suppose N equal to two, and also D equal to two.

428
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,700
What is the spectrum, right, frequency response,

429
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,180
let's say, after the analysis, all right?

430
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,020
So we have to do this one by one, right?

431
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,980
Let's think about what happened

432
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,340
after you performed the analysis filter, all right?

433
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,100
After you do analysis filter, input is actually X zero.

434
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
After that, you should have two output, right?

435
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,220
Remember, every channel should get output.

436
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,100
So can we derive the representation

437
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,320
of the output of the analysis filters?

438
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,180
In fact, we learned this, right?

439
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,060
Remember, we say that, well,

440
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,980
for both that summation and the interpolation,

441
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,740
I need you to know both the time domain

442
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,820
and the frequency domain relationship, remember?

443
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,180
We have a big table, remember we showed that?

444
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,660
So we can use the Z transform relationship, right,

445
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,580
to represent the X output, but of course,

446
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,240
if you have the Z transform, you can easily get the omega.

447
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,820
Just need to substitute the Z with the E to power of J omega,

448
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,780
right, and if you do so, this is the formula.

449
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,980
You can simply set D equal to two, right?

450
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,060
And if you say D equal to two, you should get the formula,

451
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,940
the kind of representation like this, okay?

452
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,380
I mean, I leave this to you to do it.

453
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,620
It's not very hard.

454
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,580
You just need to set D equal to two,

455
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,580
and then you need to change the Z to E to power of J omega,

456
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,660
all right, and you represent everything in omega domain.

457
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,300
This is the one you have, all right?

458
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,320
I mean, take some time to do it

459
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,020
if you don't feel like it's so easy,

460
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,580
but it should be very straightforward.

461
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,060
Because it's D equal to two, right?

462
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,940
You only have two terms, okay?

463
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,860
The only difference is that here,

464
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,100
the first channel, you have H zero.

465
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,820
The second channel, you have H one, right?

466
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,620
The formula should be the same,

467
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,020
but make sure you are denoting the low-pass filter

468
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,540
in different way, right, H one, H zero, okay?

469
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,060
So these two will be correspondingly the spectrum

470
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:00,060
of your output, right, in each channel, here and here, okay?

471
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,460
All right, so now, of course,

472
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,300
with the non-idealness of the low-pass filter, right,

473
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,700
it could have some aliasing.

474
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,900
So right now, we have no guarantee there's no aliasing,

475
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
unless you have ideal filter, right?

476
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,240
This is non-ideal filter, so it's possible

477
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,160
that there could be some aliasing components in the output.

478
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,280
Why, because we say that for the ideal filter,

479
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,020
you can actually use the low-pass filter

480
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,120
to get rid of the aliasing,

481
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,640
but that only when you have no transition kind of a period,

482
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,240
right, now with the transition,

483
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,320
you will have some aliasing,

484
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,420
and actually, the aliasing is the second term,

485
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,440
if you realize the first term is your ideal

486
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,400
down-sample signal, right?

487
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,040
The second term, oh, sorry, sorry, not yet, actually.

488
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,080
Oh, no, no, no, sorry, sorry, I always wanted to say it,

489
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,700
later, later, but anyway, due to the fact

490
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,680
that H zero and H one are non-ideal,

491
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,800
so there could be some aliasing components,

492
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,400
which is the, okay, which is the second term of the output,

493
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,920
so this term could give you some aliasing, all right?

494
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,120
So, and this is actually due to the consequence

495
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,240
of this non-zero transition band,

496
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,640
and this non-zero transition band

497
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,720
will end up with some overlaps, all right?

498
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,680
So now, how to represent aliasing,

499
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,600
we can actually use some kind of a, you know,

500
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,160
notation to separate the two, right?

501
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,720
So let's think about, okay, so let's think about that,

502
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,180
let's denote the, sorry, each channel of the output

503
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,320
after analysis as the XA zero and XA one,

504
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,200
so here the A stands for the analysis field stage, right?

505
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,400
Zero and a one stands for which channel, okay?

506
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,420
Let's use the subscript to denote

507
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,780
different stages of our processing.

508
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,360
Now we have to pass this to the second stage,

509
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,400
so the second stage will be the synthesis stage, right?

510
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,600
And every channel of the synthesis stage

511
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,260
is actually a interpolation, right?

512
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,900
Of course, with the non-ideal low-pass filter.

513
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,240
So in this case, you can represent

514
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,040
the interpolation process in the following, okay?

515
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,680
So where does this come from?

516
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,060
This come from the interpolation formula, right?

517
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,040
We talk about this in interpolation.

518
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,320
I always do remember, otherwise I can show you, right?

519
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,760
So you can actually go to our, what is that?

520
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,420
Lecture four, right?

521
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,260
If you go to our lecture four, we have this table.

522
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,440
Where is it?

523
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,200
Here, right.

524
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,280
So just now what I'm showing you is the decimation.

525
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,760
This is where the decimation come from,

526
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,960
which is actually the analysis part.

527
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,680
So if it's a synthesis part,

528
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,560
this will be the Z-transfer we need, right?

529
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,120
And you can tell that the only change that happens

530
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,260
is the signal itself, right?

531
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:58,160
The omega is actually multiplied by I time, right?

532
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,660
So here in our case, I is two.

533
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,300
That's why all of these omega will multiply by two times.

534
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,120
Make sense?

535
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,640
So in this case, you can now represent the final output

536
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,880
as a function of the X signal.

537
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,640
But here the S stands for the synthesis stage, right?

538
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,800
X zero and X one, okay?

539
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,980
But of course, later we can see that you can assume

540
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,400
the X A zero equal to S zero

541
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,340
because we are doing nothing in the middle, all right?

542
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,700
So if you go back to the stage, right?

543
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,420
So let me just denote what we're talking about here.

544
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,280
I need to make sure I can edit it, right?

545
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,360
So what I mean is this.

546
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,360
Here at this stage, this is our X A zero, right?

547
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,020
And this is my X A one, right?

548
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:55,020
So those are the output of the analysis filter

549
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,840
correspondingly channel zero, channel one, right?

550
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,840
And this input is denote as X S zero.

551
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,120
And this input is X S one, right?

552
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,120
So here the S denotes the input of the synthesis filters.

553
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,800
Okay?

554
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,760
Same convention, A stands for analysis,

555
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,160
S stands for synthesis,

556
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,080
but one is output, one is input, okay?

557
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,340
So in practice, these two may not be the same

558
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,780
because if you do something here,

559
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,500
it's going to process the A into S.

560
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,720
But here, let's assume that they are the same, right?

561
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,340
Because we want to analyze how to form the low-pass filter.

562
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,560
So let's assume nothing happened between the two stage, okay?

563
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,800
So that's why they say that, well,

564
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,260
let's assume that the A always equal to S, right?

565
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,980
Here the same, A equal to S.

566
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,520
So that means your X S zero will be equal to X A zero.

567
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,240
Here X S one will be equal to X A one,

568
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,320
which was just the one we just represented

569
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,260
in the previous slide, okay?

570
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,980
So now just substitute all of this,

571
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,800
you just need to substitute all of this X A zero,

572
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:14,560
X A one, sorry, into the equation here, right?

573
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,800
You should be able to get the complete representation

574
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,480
of your final output, because final output

575
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,160
is nothing but summing them together, right?

576
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,800
You just need to sum the first term

577
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,240
with the second term together,

578
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,120
you should be able to form the final signal representation

579
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
using the frequency spectrum, right?

580
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,800
Using the frequency representation, all right?

581
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,320
Okay, so feel free to derive it themselves,

582
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,960
because that's also a good practice for you

583
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,040
to get familiar with the interpolation and decimation.

584
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,920
Like I mentioned, you need to know what happened

585
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,720
if you perform interpolation or decimation.

586
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,040
You need to know both the time domain and frequency domain.

587
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,680
So this is a good example for you to practice, right?

588
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,080
And it's not very challenging, because D equal to two,

589
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,940
right, it's a very simple example.

590
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,840
Okay, but you should be able to get

591
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,840
the overall representation, all the way from the X

592
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,440
to the final reconstruction of X hat.

593
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,020
So here the X is your original input.

594
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,320
X hat is the final reconstruction, final output.

595
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,760
So like I mentioned just now for filter bank,

596
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,240
if nothing happened in the middle

597
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,940
between analysis and the synthesis, right,

598
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,080
and good filter bank should give you

599
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,680
the original signal as the output.

600
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,940
In other words, what we're trying to reach or achieve

601
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,940
is nothing but making the X hat equal to X, right?

602
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,840
Makes sense, because now I'm assuming

603
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,480
that nothing happened in the analysis

604
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,960
and the synthesis in the middle, where nothing happened.

605
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,100
So I want to make sure my filter bank

606
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,720
is just as good as the one we talked about last week,

607
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,280
which is using the ideal filter, right?

608
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,940
So right now, of course, the filter is not ideal,

609
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,140
but we still want to have a perfect reconstruction

610
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,300
of my original signal,

611
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,300
which is making your X hat equal to original X, right?

612
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,220
So how can we achieve this?

613
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,220
How can we achieve that, the original signal, like X?

614
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,040
Oh, actually not, right?

615
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,100
So let me see, let me see, okay, actually it's not.

616
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,500
Oh, actually, okay, they are looking

617
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,340
for something slightly worse, slightly weak, okay.

618
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,460
So what they're trying to do is that they want to make sure

619
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,220
the second term, which is the adiasing, to be zero.

620
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,580
Okay, so I was wrong.

621
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,460
Actually, they didn't really require this term

622
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,700
to be perfect with reconstruction,

623
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,440
but they wish to make sure the second term,

624
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,220
which is actually the adiasing, to be zero, okay?

625
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,160
So why this is true?

626
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,220
Because if you don't have the adiasing term, right,

627
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,500
only your baseband signal should survive

628
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,620
in these filter banks.

629
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,380
So the baseband signal will be corresponding

630
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,740
to the first term, right?

631
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,500
Remember, the baseband signal is actually your X omega,

632
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,500
but if we do have some adiasing,

633
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,540
or we have some kind of overlapping in the low-pass

634
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,740
and high-pass kind of spectrum,

635
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,340
there will be an adiasing coming from the next version.

636
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,020
So originally you have X omega,

637
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,940
but the signal is actually periodic.

638
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,180
You have another kind of spectrum,

639
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,320
which happens at shifted by pi, right?

640
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,040
So we want to make sure the adiasing doesn't happen.

641
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,560
So all of these components should be zero,

642
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,360
because we shouldn't see any adiasing generated

643
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,880
from the shifted version of the baseband, right?

644
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,200
So I hope you still remember

645
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,660
where the adiasing coming from, right?

646
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,320
If you review the lecture four,

647
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,440
we say that the adiasing coming from the fact

648
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,740
that you do have some overlapping,

649
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,640
so after you do all of this shrinking of your spectrum,

650
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,640
you have some overlapping,

651
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,880
not shrinking, stretching of the spectrum,

652
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,640
you have some overlapping coming

653
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,140
from the next kind of periodic periods, right?

654
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,700
Your baseband signal, which is actually X omega,

655
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,580
but your next shift will be X omega minus pi, right?

656
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,500
So if they have some signal overlap

657
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,060
with your current signal,

658
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,900
that one becomes the adiasing, all right?

659
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,700
So in that sense, what we're trying to do

660
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:15,700
is to make sure there's no contribution from this guy, right?

661
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,260
In other words, we want to make sure

662
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,660
all of these weights in front, sorry,

663
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:26,300
all of these weights in front, this guy must be zero, right?

664
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,100
So the weights in front describe how much energy

665
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,540
or how much concentration are coming from the,

666
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,520
you know, kind of the first duplicate, right?

667
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,060
The first shifted version.

668
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,400
So if you make this term to be zero,

669
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,260
it's basically saying that the reconstruction result

670
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,800
is actually adiasing-free.

671
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,300
You are able to eliminate the adiasing, right?

672
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,540
Make sense?

673
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,160
Okay, so now the question is like,

674
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,940
how can we make this term to be zero, right?

675
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,920
We understand our objective, right?

676
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,140
This is something we want to achieve,

677
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,060
but we need to understand

678
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,380
when this condition can be achieved, okay?

679
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,120
So of course, the good thing is that we have the choice,

680
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,180
right, we can choose our, you know, the four filters,

681
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,300
H zero, G zero, H one, and G one in whatever we would like,

682
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,060
but of course, they can never be ideal, okay?

683
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,580
So you can choose whatever non-ideal filter you like.

684
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,260
As long as you make this term to be zero, you are good.

685
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,100
You are done.

686
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,440
The job is done, right?

687
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,180
So by looking at this equation, right,

688
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,420
this is the objective.

689
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,740
What can you think about?

690
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,660
I mean, if you are going to pick the G zero, H zero,

691
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,700
and the G one, H one, what should be the choice

692
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,900
of these four filters

693
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,300
to make the entire contribution to be zero?

694
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,980
What do you think?

695
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,060
I mean, this is something we want to achieve, right?

696
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,940
So the whole idea of going through the analysis,

697
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,940
synthesis analysis is to understand

698
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,780
when we say these filters, eight is in three,

699
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,260
what do we mean, right?

700
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,580
And now we get this equation and say,

701
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,020
hey, if this term equal to zero,

702
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,020
we should be able to eliminate the contribution

703
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,180
from the second term, right?

704
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,980
But what kind of choice of H zero and G zero

705
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,940
can make this term to be zero?

706
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,180
Do you find some kind of a trivial way

707
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,540
or maybe easy way to get it to be zero?

708
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,840
So remember, you have the full control of the filters, right?

709
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,780
The only constraint is that your H zero must be low pass.

710
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,820
Your H one must be high pass, right?

711
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,980
Similarly, your G zero must be low pass.

712
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,680
Your G one must be high pass.

713
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,520
That's it.

714
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,060
Remember, they have to be complementary, right?

715
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,140
So one have to cover part of the spectrum,

716
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,660
the other have to cover the rest of the spectrum.

717
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,660
Other than that, you have full control of, say,

718
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,060
how can we relate G and H?

719
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,940
Okay, so what do you think is the easy condition

720
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,740
to make this term to be zero?

721
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,640
Any thoughts?

722
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,060
So this is actually equation, right?

723
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,300
You have how many variables?

724
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,980
You have four variables.

725
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,320
And you have one equation.

726
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,660
You cannot really work out the filter response exactly,

727
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,320
but you may have some relationship

728
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,660
between the H and G, right, through this equation.

729
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,460
Okay, so think about this case, right?

730
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,840
So if this is zero,

731
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,140
what's the immediate thing come to your mind?

732
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,460
Basically, you only have two terms,

733
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,220
the first term and the second term.

734
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,980
Basically, the first term will be the negative

735
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,860
of the second term, right?

736
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,220
Make sense?

737
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,260
You wanna cancel each other.

738
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,820
The only way to cancel each other,

739
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,100
unless they're both zero, right?

740
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,140
They can be both zero.

741
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,380
I mean, very unlikely they can be both zero.

742
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,420
I mean, there's one chance if the,

743
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,340
these two filters are complementary.

744
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,380
In other words, there's no overlap, right?

745
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,960
This is actually the ideal case.

746
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,660
If you have two kind of a spectrum

747
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,060
which are completely orthogonal,

748
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,940
but you may not have that.

749
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,900
But the general case is that the first term

750
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,780
were equal to the minus of the second term, all right?

751
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,900
Very straightforward.

752
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,720
And then, if this is the case, right,

753
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,140
you wanna make sure the first term

754
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,060
is equal to the minus of the second term.

755
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,420
And of course, your H zero cannot be H one, remember?

756
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,240
Because H zero and H one must cover a different spectrum.

757
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,500
They cannot be the same, right?

758
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,460
Otherwise, you are not doing a spec of filter banks.

759
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,500
The only choice you have is to make the H zero term

760
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,220
to be the same as the G one term.

761
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,700
And then, correspondingly, the G zero term

762
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,140
to be the same as the H one term,

763
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,980
to make them the same in a cross way, right?

764
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,900
Make sense?

765
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,100
I mean, there could be other choice,

766
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,460
but this is the easy option, right?

767
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,340
So if you somehow make the H zero to be the same as G one,

768
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,320
the G zero to be, let's say, minus H one.

769
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,860
So in the cross way, they're the same,

770
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,020
the two term will be cancel each other, right?

771
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,140
And then you can make the whole thing to be zero, right?

772
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,900
So this is like an easy way to come up with one solution.

773
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,700
So that means I can crossly make the G zero,

774
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,140
okay, this is actually coming from here,

775
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,360
the G zero equal to the H one,

776
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,720
but remember, here's the shifted version of H one,

777
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,260
so you do shift that by pi, all right?

778
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,700
So making the G zero to be the shifted version of the H one,

779
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,380
and making the G one to be the shifted version

780
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,020
and the minus of H zero.

781
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,940
So in the cross way, they are equal,

782
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,420
and of course, you need to have a minus sign

783
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,900
to cancel each other, right?

784
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,620
So this will be one condition,

785
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,500
or actually the condition for QMF.

786
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,740
QMF uses this condition, all right?

787
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,180
So this will be the condition that making the set of filters

788
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,580
the four filters to satisfy QMF kind of requirement,

789
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,900
all right, and then if that's true,

790
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,060
we assume H zero to be low pass,

791
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,460
of course, it can be the other way around,

792
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,220
but let's assume that the first channel is low pass,

793
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,260
and then H one will be the high pass, sorry,

794
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,340
sorry, H one is the low pass, H one will be the high pass,

795
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,780
right, and actually, we can set the H one

796
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,140
to be the mirror image high pass filter,

797
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,740
which is something like this, right?

798
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,540
So if you assume that your H zero

799
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,420
is like a non-ideal low pass filter,

800
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,500
in which case you do have a transition period

801
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,660
from here to here, you can assume

802
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,700
that your H one will be the opposite,

803
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,460
I mean, the mirrored version of it,

804
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,500
and of course, it's going to be the high pass, right,

805
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,180
because now the pass is actually

806
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,180
in the high frequency region, all right?

807
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,980
So this is the way you can construct the H one,

808
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,780
and of course, by using this formula, right,

809
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,860
you can assume that, let's say my H zero,

810
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,860
let's call it H zero is actually some kind of a prototype,

811
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,820
H, and the H one will be the mirrored version

812
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,100
of the H itself, so that's how you can make

813
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,460
the H zero and the H one to be the pairs, right,

814
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,540
and these two will form the pair of high pass and low pass,

815
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,420
all right, okay?

816
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,220
So, but of course, this is the spectrum, right,

817
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,860
we say that if you have the spectrum relationship,

818
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,140
you can also work out the time domain relationship,

819
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,820
how to do it, well, you do the inverse DTFT, right,

820
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,220
and inverse DTFT says that if you have a shift in the phase,

821
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,500
sorry, you have a delay in the phase,

822
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,220
it's in the frequency, it should be correspondingly

823
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,420
a phase shift in the time domain,

824
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,540
remember, you will have some E to power of minus J,

825
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,460
what is that, N pi, right, something like this,

826
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,700
so according to different Ns,

827
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,660
it's going to be one, minus one, one, minus one,

828
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,580
so that's why you get this term, right,

829
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,060
this term coming from the corresponding phase shift,

830
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,580
so remember that phase shift in one domain

831
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,220
will be the delay in the other domain, right,

832
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,420
vice versa, okay, that's how you get this,

833
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,420
and then this 10.6 is the time domain relationship

834
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,540
between the mirrored filters, H one and H zero,

835
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,980
so H one and H zero, they must be complementary,

836
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,820
so one is low pass, the other must be high pass,

837
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,220
and to make it kind of aliasing free,

838
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,180
they must be a kind of mirrored version,

839
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,100
you just flip them, so that even if,

840
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,140
even if there's some kind of transition function,

841
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,940
sorry, transition period,

842
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,920
they are kind of transition in a mirrored way, all right,

843
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,580
so even though there are some overlap,

844
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,660
but they're kind of like a mirrored version,

845
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,740
so as a consequence, right,

846
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,220
these two will have the mirror images symmetric

847
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,760
at the frequency pi over two, so this is always true,

848
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,600
when you do mirroring,

849
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,340
you have to make them symmetric at pi over two,

850
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,220
why, because the delay here is pi, right,

851
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,980
you're shifting pi, you will have the symmetric point,

852
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,120
which is at pi over two, all right,

853
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,880
so this will be the kind of visualization of the spectrum,

854
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,080
when you talk about this mirror image symmetry property,

855
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,780
right, okay, so this is the plot,

856
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,820
this is the frequency domain relationship,

857
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,340
this is the time domain relationship,

858
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,700
so make sure you know how you can get one from the other,

859
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,340
right, and of course, you know,

860
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,120
what kind of form of transition is up to you, right,

861
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,780
I mean, this is just some illustration,

862
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,540
your transition can be like a wider,

863
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,060
your transition can be shorter, it can be different form,

864
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,300
but they must be symmetric, all right,

865
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:48,020
that's the principle, okay, all right,

866
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,020
so this is what we need to impose, right,

867
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,000
and then, where is this constraint,

868
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,180
just now we talk about H, right,

869
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,660
now we can correspondingly talk about the G,

870
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,920
remember the G and H are related in this way, right,

871
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,220
this is actually the GH correlation,

872
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,600
so once you have the pair of H,

873
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,960
you can work out the pair of G,

874
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,740
so in this case, G zero will be equal to the prototype H,

875
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,440
G one will be the mirror version plus,

876
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,720
and also a sign change, right, so two things,

877
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,560
so your G zero will be equal to the H zero,

878
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,560
in other words, so because H zero equal to H, right,

879
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,280
so your G zero will be equal to H,

880
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,040
will be H equal to H zero,

881
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,560
your G one will be the symmetric version

882
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,440
of H plus a minus sign, so don't forget a minus sign,

883
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,440
all right, so that's how you can derive your G one, okay,

884
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,960
but even though we have four filters,

885
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,000
there's only one prototype H, so once you give me the H,

886
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,360
if you tell me this is actually a QMF,

887
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,880
I can derive all of the four filters,

888
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,760
so all of the four filters will only have one free filter,

889
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,960
which is H, okay, all of the four

890
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,920
will be varied version of my H.

891
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,760
What is H?

892
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,920
That's up to you, I mean, you can pick

893
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,720
your own low-pass filter H, but once you pick that,

894
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,440
if you want me to construct the QMF,

895
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,540
I have a fixed way to do it, right,

896
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,000
and then this equation tell me

897
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,920
how I can construct the G pairs, all right?

898
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,600
Questions, I hope this makes sense, all right?

899
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,640
If it doesn't, let me know, I can explain it again,

900
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,800
but basically, this is one way to construct a filter bank

901
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,520
with an ideal filter, right, in other words,

902
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,800
your filter may not have a sharp transition,

903
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,120
slow transition that also works, so correspondingly, right,

904
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,560
we can convert the frequency domain into time domain,

905
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,440
so in the time domain, similarly,

906
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,360
there's a phase shift, sorry,

907
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,560
there's a delay in the frequency,

908
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,440
you have a phase shift, also there's a minus one,

909
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,360
so observe the minus one here, right,

910
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,160
and note that there could be a scaling factor in overall,

911
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,160
but the scaling factor is actually not the critical one,

912
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,920
the critical one is that we wish to make sure

913
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,120
the aliasing components actually vanish, right,

914
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,120
so using the QMF will make sure the second term,

915
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,640
which is the aliasing term, will be completely canceled,

916
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,480
by the aliasing term,

917
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,240
aliasing actually corresponding to this term,

918
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,160
so the important thing is that this term

919
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,960
will be eliminated if we have QMF.

920
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,680
Original form may have some scaling,

921
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,840
but that doesn't matter, right,

922
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,720
the scaling will not change the waveform, right,

923
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,240
this term erased, that's the most important thing we need.

924
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,080
Okay?

925
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,040
Okay, so that's the first thing,

926
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,880
the other thing, well, is that,

927
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,160
so all of these aliasing coming from the decimation

928
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,640
in the analysis will be perfectly canceled,

929
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,760
and then this is due to the fact

930
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,640
that when you do interpolation, right,

931
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,280
there are also going to be some kind of a distortion,

932
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,520
so by doing the QMF,

933
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,200
these two distortions will be canceled each other,

934
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,120
so overall, in overall sense, there will be no aliasing,

935
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,440
all right, but if the question ask you,

936
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,920
if you use QMF, will there be aliasing,

937
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,000
not in the final stage, but in the channel-wise X,

938
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,680
that's possible, right, you will still have some aliasing

939
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,380
as in the XA, okay,

940
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,960
so this is actually a common mistake people make, right,

941
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,960
so what we have here is to guarantee this term to be zero,

942
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,240
and this term is the aliasing in the final X hat, all right,

943
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,400
so here, when we say cancel aliasing,

944
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,480
we're only in cancel aliasing in the final X hat,

945
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,920
but we cannot guarantee that the aliasing

946
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,280
in the after the analysis filter is canceled,

947
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,080
no, this is still there,

948
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,480
you will still have possibly some aliasing

949
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,600
in the output of analysis filter, right,

950
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,440
because analysis filter, you use line ideal filter,

951
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,820
so you could have some aliasing,

952
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,980
so QMF cannot happen preventing this guy,

953
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,980
the QMF cannot get this guy to be zero,

954
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,580
no, they're still not zero,

955
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,380
so there will be some aliasing

956
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,680
after analysis filter back, right,

957
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,620
but the QMF can make sure those aliasing term

958
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,140
will be canceled after the interpolation,

959
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,100
after the synthesis, okay,

960
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,000
this is what the QMF is doing,

961
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,540
so it's not true to say that if you do QMF,

962
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,260
the entire process have no aliasing,

963
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,680
so this is not true, only in the final reconstruction,

964
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,520
we can guarantee there's no aliasing,

965
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,320
all right, so that's a common mistake people make,

966
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,880
okay, good, so in some sense,

967
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,320
you want the two part to cancel each other, right,

968
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,080
interpolation give you some problems,

969
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,360
you know, decimation give you some problem,

970
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,480
but unfortunately they can cancel each other,

971
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,440
so you got no problem, right, in the end,

972
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,720
this is actually the beauty of QMF, all right,

973
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,120
okay, so that's what you need to know,

974
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,400
and let's see, right,

975
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,400
okay, okay, and then now we have all of this H,

976
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,000
H0, H1, G0, and G1, right,

977
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,560
and now if you put them together into your,

978
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,160
remember we have overall representation

979
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,480
from the X hat to X, right,

980
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,080
if you put them together,

981
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,880
you can work out the frequency spectrum

982
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,960
of the entire system, remember,

983
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,320
you can treat the entire filter bank as one system, right,

984
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,320
and if you work out the,

985
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,840
something like a frequency response of the H,

986
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,720
the entire thing is just like a,

987
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,920
you know, E to power of something,

988
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,720
so this term will possibly give you some phase change,

989
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,200
but phase change is okay,

990
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,840
as long as we don't have any areas in term, right,

991
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,000
so if you cancel areas in term,

992
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,200
the overall response will be just some, you know,

993
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,420
E to power of minus J omega K, right,

994
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,100
which is possibly some phase shift, all right,

995
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:46,040
so ideally we will have this to be kind of a,

996
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,920
like a phase shift,

997
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,160
and actually you can actually form a polyphase form, right,

998
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,700
to represent the H1, sorry, H0 and H1 specifically,

999
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,880
I mean, I won't really test on this, to be honest,

1000
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,880
but you probably know this, right,

1001
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,960
so we can do polyphase for filter bank

1002
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,380
that we talked about last week,

1003
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,960
right now we can also do a polyphase form for the QMF, right,

1004
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,480
because QMF is nothing but a filter bank,

1005
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,460
so it's the same thing,

1006
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,220
if you can do polyphase to implement

1007
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,000
the filter bank in general,

1008
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,840
you can also do a polyphase filter,

1009
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,400
a polyphase realization for QMF,

1010
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,560
which would be something like this,

1011
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,280
but I won't really test on this,

1012
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,760
because polyphase is more for increasing the efficiency,

1013
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,840
right, but it will give you the same result

1014
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,120
as the original filter bank, right,

1015
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,680
but this is just to say that you can,

1016
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,880
it's perfectly fine to do the polyphase realization

1017
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,480
of the QMF, which is even simpler case

1018
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,040
than filter bank in general, right, okay?

1019
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,520
So, what else do we have here?

1020
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,320
So, okay, this is about a linear phase,

1021
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,640
so if your H itself is a linear phase filter, right,

1022
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,400
and your HR, so remember linear,

1023
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,320
if it's a filter, it's a linear phase,

1024
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,440
your phase term will have a linear relationship,

1025
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,260
so you won't have additional kind of phase shift,

1026
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,520
right, everything is linear,

1027
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,640
and the real part will be a, you know,

1028
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,160
kind of a filter length of N, right,

1029
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,580
you can represent it using a FIR, basically,

1030
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:27,060
and the overall transfer function of the two-channel QMF,

1031
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,360
which use a linear phase FIR will be the following, right,

1032
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,240
you can actually represent your entire system

1033
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,220
of the QMF with a FIR design, right,

1034
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,920
but I think that's more about, you know,

1035
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,280
talking about how can you come up with a, you know,

1036
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,440
kind of finite order of the FIR to represent a QMF,

1037
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,480
which, yeah, it's good to know,

1038
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,440
but again, I mean, I probably will not test on this,

1039
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,540
and what else do we have?

1040
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,260
If it's a delay of the N sample, right, of the,

1041
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,540
huh, I don't even remember, I put this one in my slides,

1042
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,700
okay, yes, delay of N minus one samples,

1043
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,720
and a magnitude of the characteristics of this.

1044
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,120
Okay, I think I want to test you guys on this, actually.

1045
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,920
Let me look at what I have here.

1046
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,060
Okay, I will not test you on the FIR,

1047
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,460
so maybe I will just remove these slides, okay.

1048
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,880
So the only thing you need to know is the condition, right,

1049
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,700
so I will just remove the FIR things,

1050
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,320
because it's kind of something I'm not gonna test you on,

1051
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,500
so I will just remove the two.

1052
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,920
So the only thing I need to know is that

1053
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,560
when we say a system is a QMF, right,

1054
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,640
how can you come up with the design?

1055
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,880
So I could give you some kind of a, you know,

1056
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,080
H function, H omega, and you need to tell me

1057
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,120
what are the four filters, right,

1058
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:57,120
and if I use a QMF to process my signal, right,

1059
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,200
I could give you some signal as input,

1060
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,960
so you need to tell me after this kind of a QMF

1061
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,400
what is the output, right, and here I put nothing,

1062
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,320
so here I put nothing in between, remember?

1063
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,020
I say that, well, here in between we have no processing,

1064
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,640
because I want to prove that,

1065
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,480
what is the requirement of a QMF,

1066
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,860
but in practice I could give you some processing in between.

1067
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:22,200
Okay, so you need to tell me if there's a processing

1068
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,240
in channel zero, channel one correspondingly, right,

1069
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,280
what will be the corresponding X?

1070
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,560
So how can you derive that?

1071
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,200
You have to be very familiar

1072
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,280
with all of this representation, right,

1073
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,520
so after analysis, what's going to be

1074
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,040
the Z domain representation,

1075
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,160
what's going to be the omega representation,

1076
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,580
and then, followed by the synthesis, right,

1077
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:44,800
what will be the change after you go from the,

1078
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,240
here the XS to the final X hat, right,

1079
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,600
so if you know both of these two stages,

1080
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,120
analysis plus synthesis, you should be able

1081
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,240
to derive the output, even if there's

1082
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,160
any processing in the middle, all right,

1083
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,880
so this is something I wish you to know.

1084
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,760
The other thing is the design of the four filters, right,

1085
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,640
H0, H1, G0, and G1, what is the requirement

1086
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,280
if you call them QMF, right,

1087
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,800
you need to tell me exactly the requirement,

1088
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,700
and also you need to tell me,

1089
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,520
after the requirement is satisfied, right,

1090
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,600
what's the overall frequency response,

1091
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,740
or transfer function, all right,

1092
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,080
so this is all you need to know.

1093
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,600
So forget about FIR, so I will just leave that aside, okay,

1094
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,760
but you have to be very clear

1095
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,920
about the requirement, condition,

1096
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,520
and also, analytically, what is the formulation,

1097
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,040
what's the form to reconstruct the signal

1098
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,440
from the beginning, all right,

1099
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,200
so this is what I need you to know.

1100
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,440
Okay, so all of them should be covered until,

1101
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,400
so, size 12, right, so up here, up to here,

1102
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,660
that's the things you need to know,

1103
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,600
and be very familiar with, all right?

1104
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,900
Okay, any questions?

1105
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,880
So let's look at one example, right,

1106
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,680
I think this is actually a good example to,

1107
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,040
it's just a practice, right,

1108
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,040
so I could give you something like this,

1109
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,880
where I say, hey, I consider a two-channel QMF,

1110
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,080
oh, by the way, later on, I'm going to talk about

1111
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,160
possible extension to more channels, okay,

1112
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,600
but you just need to know that,

1113
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,600
even though all of these discussions,

1114
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,080
what we talk about here is only for two channels,

1115
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,760
in practice, you can always generalize to more channels,

1116
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,760
okay, I'm going to tell you how to generalize,

1117
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,100
but I will not give you a question like for more channels,

1118
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,260
the reason is it's too complicated,

1119
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,340
you have to write down many lines, right,

1120
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,220
so I think two channels is good enough, all right,

1121
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,860
so make sure you can derive the two channels,

1122
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,440
so this could be one of the, you know,

1123
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,660
example questions that you may see, right,

1124
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,540
so I could give you a diagram like this,

1125
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:44,260
so this is like a very standard analysis filter bank,

1126
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,100
I could give you some kind of, maybe filters,

1127
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,220
I could maybe give you one, right,

1128
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:52,220
say, hey, I tell you this is my H0, okay,

1129
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,180
okay, I may not give you others,

1130
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,940
but you should be able to derive other filters

1131
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,980
using the QMF condition, all right,

1132
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:03,700
so, and then I could ask you to verify,

1133
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,540
for example, what will be the output, right,

1134
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:10,220
in the, let's say, first channel, second channel,

1135
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,400
both in the frequency domain or in the time domain,

1136
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,380
so you need to be able to convert the representation

1137
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,180
from the frequency to the time, all right, just like this,

1138
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:22,300
if this is my, you know, Z domain relationship,

1139
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,680
I should be able to kind of form the output

1140
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,260
in the time domain representation, all right,

1141
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,740
how to do it, you can do inverse Z transform

1142
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,700
or you can do inverse DTFT, right,

1143
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,200
but bear in mind that the, if we have a minus sign here,

1144
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,080
if you have a two here, what does that mean?

1145
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,780
In time domain, right, so basically,

1146
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,020
Z to the power minus one is nothing but delay

1147
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,480
in the time domain, right, so you should correspondently

1148
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,400
have a delay here, right, that's where they come from,

1149
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,880
all right, so you can actually use this as an exercise,

1150
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,880
but I will give you some other form of H for sure,

1151
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,080
I won't give you the same, but some other form of H,

1152
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,760
but how to derive the other filters,

1153
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,100
it should be all covered here, right,

1154
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,300
this is how you can derive it, and, sorry,

1155
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,240
this is how you can relate your H to H zero and H one,

1156
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,240
right, so you should be familiar with that,

1157
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,640
both in omega domain and also in the time domain, okay?

1158
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,060
I hope I simplified it a bit so you don't confuse,

1159
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,120
like, we have too many things,

1160
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,080
you don't know how to prepare,

1161
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,620
but this is all you need to know, all right,

1162
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,960
and there will be a question on this, I can guarantee you,

1163
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,460
right, there will be one question,

1164
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:33,900
not too many, but one, okay, one sub-question, all right?

1165
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,240
Okay, good, so any questions so far for QMF?

1166
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,180
Okay, two channels, I mean, you need to know two channels.

1167
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,600
All right, so, after that, right,

1168
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,680
I'm gonna quickly go through how we can,

1169
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,340
I think, wait, I think this is not updated, I,

1170
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,640
okay, let me double-check,

1171
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,160
I should have updated this slide.

1172
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,200
Why I'm opening slides that,

1173
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,680
let me see, it's because I didn't update it,

1174
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,380
I think I removed some of the components from the,

1175
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,960
okay, maybe I should check this one,

1176
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,080
okay, give me a second,

1177
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,280
because I remember I removed some of the components,

1178
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,820
I don't know why they comes back again.

1179
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,700
Oh, okay, maybe I forgot to save that,

1180
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,400
but anyway, so that's fine.

1181
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,280
Okay, so, these parts, I'm not going to test on that,

1182
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,920
even though I leave that here,

1183
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,920
because it shows you that sometimes, right,

1184
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,360
you don't limit yourself to only two channels,

1185
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,840
okay, you can actually go for more channels,

1186
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,560
all right, but I will not test on this part,

1187
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,420
because the computation is so complicated.

1188
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,800
But the idea here is that,

1189
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,800
if you can decompose the frequency channel into two,

1190
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,400
right, you can keep dividing.

1191
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,200
So, for example, now I have, let's say,

1192
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,800
half of my spectrum,

1193
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,720
I already have analysis filter to extract,

1194
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,300
let's say, zero to pi over two, right.

1195
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,360
If I want to further divide that spectrum,

1196
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,120
and I don't have ideal filter,

1197
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,440
I can keep using my QMF to divide it, right.

1198
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,840
So, that's how somehow you can progressively divide

1199
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,360
the entire spectrum into, let's say,

1200
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,000
smaller and smaller section.

1201
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,760
So, basically, if you know how to design a QMF

1202
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,460
for two channels, you should be able to further expand

1203
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,000
the division progressively for every sub-channel, right.

1204
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,160
So, that's how people use this to realize,

1205
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,720
for example, wavelets, right,

1206
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,260
if you think about wavelets, how you do that,

1207
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,560
you are keep dividing the space into low and high,

1208
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,380
you can do one more cycle, one more level,

1209
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,540
to keep dividing the low channel

1210
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,380
into low-low and high-high, right.

1211
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,700
So, that's how you do it.

1212
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:50,280
And same way for, practically, when you design it,

1213
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,940
you are going to divide them into several bands,

1214
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,620
and each band will be encoded separately

1215
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,320
with different accuracy, right.

1216
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,160
So, in practice, the only thing you need to make sure

1217
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,260
is that every division, right, in every division,

1218
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:07,520
the design of the filter must satisfy the QMM condition,

1219
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,800
the way we talk about, right, they must be symmetric,

1220
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,720
at the position of pi over two,

1221
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,200
but then, when you divide it, this symmetric point

1222
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,200
will be not necessarily the pi over two, right,

1223
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,240
it could be pi over four, or maybe pi over eight,

1224
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,800
that's how you can progressively kind of divide it,

1225
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,280
and the synthesis will be the opposite, right.

1226
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,200
So, in other words, if you have, let's say,

1227
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,080
here, your channel one, channel two, three, and four,

1228
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,400
in your analysis kind of design,

1229
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,280
when you do a synthesis, they must be symmetric.

1230
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,160
In other words, you have the first synthesis one and two,

1231
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,480
and followed by the synthesis of that with three,

1232
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,000
and that with four, all right.

1233
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,840
So, basically, analysis kind of filter bank,

1234
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,800
you need to keep dividing your signal

1235
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,440
into different spectrum distribution.

1236
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,920
In the synthesis part, they should be also

1237
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,120
kind of synthesized in a progressive way, right.

1238
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,320
In this case, I mean, one and two will be synthesized first,

1239
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,240
and then followed by three, followed by four, right.

1240
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,480
But every pair, right, the filters here,

1241
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,920
every pair of the filter will be satisfying

1242
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,040
the QMF condition, all right.

1243
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,960
This is actually the principle of the,

1244
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,760
how should I say, generalized the two channel

1245
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,220
into more channels, right.

1246
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,120
So, I mean, practice, this could be some design, right.

1247
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,840
So, this is the QMF for two channels,

1248
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,840
this is the QMF for three channels, right.

1249
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,520
So, you are keep dividing the first channel,

1250
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:31,000
or you can further divide it into like a third layer, right.

1251
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,080
So, this is actually the case,

1252
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:36,280
you are going to have four channels in the QMF design, right.

1253
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,720
But every division, they must be satisfying

1254
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,040
the symmetric property, right.

1255
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,560
Okay, so I will not give you a test on that,

1256
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,200
but you need to know how you can generalize

1257
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,320
two channel QMF to higher amount of channels, right.

1258
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,360
This is the way they generalize.

1259
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,440
And for those of you who know wavelets,

1260
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,400
or maybe even people talking about DCT, right,

1261
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,240
that's actually the principle.

1262
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,360
They don't directly go to like say eight channel,

1263
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,280
but they do this progressively every time just by two, right.

1264
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,440
That's the principle of the designing filter banks

1265
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,440
in practice, right.

1266
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,280
So, okay.

1267
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,680
Okay, you know, this is for you to rate.

1268
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,560
I'm not going to test you and say,

1269
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,840
hey, come up with the relationship for,

1270
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,920
you know, zero, zero, zero, one, and you know, one, zero.

1271
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,560
That's kind of too complicated.

1272
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,360
But you should know the philosophy, right.

1273
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,520
And I just pretty much skip this part.

1274
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,440
Feel free to rate it because it's a good practice

1275
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,880
for you to apply the true two channel QMF

1276
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,980
for more channels, right.

1277
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:42,800
And similarly, if two channel QMF, sorry,

1278
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:47,800
if a filter bank can be implemented using FFT, right,

1279
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,800
you can also do a polyphase realization

1280
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,160
for M channel QMF as well, right.

1281
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,600
It's the same kind of philosophy.

1282
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,040
And you can speed up the processing

1283
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,620
using a similar way, right.

1284
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,240
Okay, so I think that's all I need to cover, actually.

1285
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,560
I will not give you any question on this part,

1286
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,360
but you just need to make sure, you know,

1287
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,840
any questions regarding, I mean, not even here, right.

1288
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,440
I think I kind of deleted this part.

1289
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,340
So you just need to make sure up to this point, right.

1290
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,080
For two channel question, you know every relationship

1291
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,560
for filter design, for signal representation,

1292
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,400
and how can come up with a perfect signal reconstruction

1293
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,300
without any aliasing, right.

1294
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,400
That will be good enough for you.

1295
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,240
Okay.

1296
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:37,200
All right, so if no question, let's take a 15 minutes break.

1297
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,480
So next part, I will do a summary, okay.

1298
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,080
I will give a summary lecture.

1299
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,920
And meanwhile, if you have any question, right,

1300
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,880
feel free to ask me during some summary lecture

1301
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,560
because I'm going to walk you through all the thing

1302
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,640
I cover from lecture two to right now, right.

1303
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,280
So if anything unclear to me,

1304
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,720
feel free to ask.

1305
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,720
All right, so I will see you resume again around 7.45, okay.

1306
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,560
All right, great.

1307
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,120
Thank you.

1308
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,120
Okay.

1309
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,120
All right.

1310
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,120
All right.

1311
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,120
All right.

1312
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,120
All right.

1313
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,120
All right.

1314
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,120
All right.

1315
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,120
All right.

1316
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,120
All right.

1317
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,120
All right.

1318
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,120
All right.

1319
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,120
All right.

1320
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,120
All right.

1321
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,120
All right.

1322
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,120
All right.

1323
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,120
All right.

1324
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,120
All right.

1325
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,120
All right.

1326
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,120
All right.

1327
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,120
All right.

1328
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,120
All right.

1329
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,120
All right.

1330
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,120
All right.

1331
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,120
All right.

1332
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,120
All right.

1333
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,120
All right.

1334
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,120
All right.

1335
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,120
All right.

1336
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,120
All right.

1337
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,120
All right.

1338
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,120
All right.

1339
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,120
All right.

1340
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,120
All right.

1341
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,120
All right.

1342
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,120
All right.

1343
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,120
All right.

1344
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,120
All right.

1345
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,120
All right.

1346
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:39,680
All right.

1347
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,320
So let's start.

1348
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,680
By the way, I think there's one question I got in the middle

1349
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,920
which is very, I think is very good.

1350
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:50,080
So there's one student tell me that here,

1351
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:53,040
if you remember, like we have a formula, right?

1352
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:57,720
Describing the time domain relationship between the,

1353
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,360
what is that?

1354
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,400
Interpolation, right?

1355
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,240
Where is the image?

1356
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,520
So the student suggested that here is actually

1357
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,160
should be coming from minus infinity,

1358
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,840
which I agree, actually.

1359
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,680
Because in the whole discussion here,

1360
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,920
we did assume the causality of the filter, remember?

1361
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,400
All of this discussion we talk about in downsampling,

1362
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,320
upsampling, we assume that the low-pass filter is actually

1363
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,560
ideal, right?

1364
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,720
So it's very hard to reach kind of a practical filter,

1365
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,840
which is ideal low-pass.

1366
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,680
So in practice, they actually assume all of the signal

1367
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,360
to be non-causality, right?

1368
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,360
So if it's non-causality, it doesn't make sense to do the,

1369
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,800
sorry, do the convolution only starting from zero.

1370
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,000
They catch it from minus zero, sorry,

1371
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,400
minus infinity, all right?

1372
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,240
Which I agree.

1373
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,760
But I just want to say that in actual exam,

1374
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,360
I won't give you like a super long signal to do convolution

1375
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,160
because that's very competitionally expensive.

1376
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:50,160
So in the actual exam, right, you just need to know

1377
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:53,040
that this is nothing but a convolution between the two.

1378
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,400
So then in this case, you just need to convolve to signal,

1379
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,680
make sure all of this overlapping part of the shift

1380
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,920
are computed, that's it.

1381
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,840
I mean, this is just the theoretical form, right?

1382
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,420
Are you going to convolve covering the minus infinity

1383
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,020
to infinity or not, right?

1384
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:10,400
I think there was, I mean, the reason this note says zero

1385
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,840
is because they somehow assume the system to be causal,

1386
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,400
right, but we're not talking about practical case.

1387
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:20,380
So it's perfectly possible to have non-causal system, right?

1388
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:21,640
I just want to clarify this point.

1389
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,620
But if it's causal system, you just need to go from zero,

1390
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:27,880
right, because all of this minus part will not be there.

1391
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,520
All right, but I think that's a reasonable question, right,

1392
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:34,840
to say that we do have to convolve from zero in this case.

1393
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,320
Okay?

1394
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:40,960
So after that, I think I'm going to give you some summary.

1395
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,360
But what I covered in, all of these things we're going

1396
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,220
to test is all covered, right?

1397
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:49,820
So whatever I haven't talked about, like AM channel QMF

1398
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:51,320
is not going to be tested, all right?

1399
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,580
So don't worry about that.

1400
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:56,780
All right, so I'm going to walk you through whatever

1401
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:58,740
we cover for this part one.

1402
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:01,020
Okay, hopefully we'll give you some idea about the,

1403
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:03,100
you know, how to prepare the exam, right?

1404
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,980
And meanwhile, if you spot any question,

1405
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,900
you can feel free to ask me, right?

1406
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,620
Again, you know, you can ask a question any time.

1407
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:10,780
You don't have to wait until the break, all right?

1408
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:13,900
So if you remember, like all of this discussion

1409
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,060
we talk about from lecture two is starting

1410
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,180
from the sampling process, all right?

1411
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,900
So you should be able to understand,

1412
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:23,140
when we say sampling process, what we mean by converting

1413
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:26,420
the analog signal to, you know, discrete signal, right?

1414
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:29,140
So this is actually the sampling process.

1415
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:32,820
And in sampling process, one of the important parameter

1416
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:36,380
is the sampling rate, right, which is FS.

1417
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:39,300
You have to specifying sampling rate always,

1418
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:42,260
if you're talking about A to D system, right?

1419
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:44,980
And the sampling rate is always one over

1420
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:46,460
the sampling period, right?

1421
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:49,380
So these two are equivalent parameters, right?

1422
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:51,820
One is the reciprocal of the others.

1423
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:56,380
And if we're talking about the discrete time domain signal,

1424
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:58,980
this is the way we are representing them, right?

1425
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:02,540
So you can representing them using the small f, sorry,

1426
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:04,900
or you can representing them using the omega,

1427
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,620
just different way to represent a frequency, right?

1428
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:12,500
And this f and omega are the normalized frequency

1429
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,300
in the hertz and the radians per seconds respectively.

1430
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:19,460
So the units are different, but if you do a two pi ratio,

1431
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:21,740
you can convert one to the other, right?

1432
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:24,900
The only thing is the change of the units, right?

1433
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,940
And now we see that, you know, some of you are,

1434
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:29,900
should be familiar with the CTFT before,

1435
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,140
but that was for analog signal.

1436
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:35,540
So for this class, we'll be mainly talking about DTFT,

1437
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:36,740
starting from DTFT, right,

1438
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:39,860
because we are interested of discrete signal.

1439
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:42,980
But you should know what's the relationship

1440
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:45,340
between CTFT and DTFT.

1441
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:48,580
So this figure shows a comparison, right?

1442
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:51,500
Basically CTFT, of course there's ICTFT,

1443
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,380
we'll be converting the analog domain,

1444
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:57,300
and the DTFT will be converting signal in the frequency,

1445
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,020
sorry, digital domain, right?

1446
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:00,860
And the way you're converting the time domain

1447
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:05,020
will be the sampling, or the other way, the interpolation.

1448
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:09,260
And again, you know, there will be aliasing formulation,

1449
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,340
the sampling theorem,

1450
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:11,980
which is also something we talk about,

1451
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:14,820
like how can we determine the critical rate

1452
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:16,580
to avoid aliasing, right?

1453
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:18,380
That kind of form the relationship

1454
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:20,500
between the analog frequency

1455
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,060
and also the digital frequency, right?

1456
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,660
This is their relationship.

1457
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,740
But of course, you need to make sure

1458
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:28,780
this critical rate is satisfied,

1459
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,740
otherwise you will have some aliasing, right,

1460
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:32,780
in your actual spectrum.

1461
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:36,500
So you need to know the relationship of the functions

1462
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,980
and, you know, of the signal domains,

1463
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:42,820
and normally we will use the I to stands for the inverse,

1464
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:44,780
right, so basically you need to know

1465
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:46,220
the pairs of the transform,

1466
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:48,780
like how can you do inverse transformers as well,

1467
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:50,860
so make sure you know the difference, right?

1468
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:53,220
We're gonna do inverse, we're gonna do forward transform,

1469
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:54,820
the base will be different,

1470
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:58,780
and for DTFT, one is summation, one is integration.

1471
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:01,380
Remember, only the time domain is discrete, right?

1472
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:03,580
The spectrum of the discrete signal

1473
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,240
will be still continuous.

1474
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,220
So if you do inverse DTFT,

1475
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:11,020
you have to make sure this kind of summation

1476
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:13,060
becomes integration, all right?

1477
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:15,100
So don't get that wrong.

1478
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,520
So talking about the sampling theorem, right,

1479
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,400
this is the theorem, I mean,

1480
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,140
maybe one of the most important theory

1481
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:23,340
in the signal processing is to tell you

1482
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:27,460
how can you make sure that these signal,

1483
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:30,820
after sampling, will be kind of aliasing-free, right?

1484
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:32,380
So basically you need to assume

1485
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:35,620
that your analog signal itself is band limited.

1486
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:37,580
So what does the band limited means?

1487
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:41,340
When you're looking at the spectrum of the signal,

1488
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:46,220
the spectrum must be zero if the frequency

1489
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:51,220
is beyond the upper limit of the frequency bands, right?

1490
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:56,180
And only the number zero, when you have W,

1491
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,700
is less than the WM.

1492
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:00,840
So this WM is the band limit, right?

1493
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:05,340
And your, I mean, if that's the case,

1494
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:07,900
your analog signal will be uniquely determined

1495
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:12,900
by its samples, where the sampling rate

1496
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:15,800
will be larger than two M.

1497
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:19,920
So if you have the sampling frequency

1498
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,400
that is larger than two WM,

1499
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,780
you will have reached the critical sampling.

1500
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:27,460
In other words, those measures can be used

1501
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:31,420
to uniquely recover the original analog signal, right?

1502
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:33,500
So this is actually what the sampling theory

1503
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,340
is talking about.

1504
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,880
So this frequency, which is the two times

1505
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,620
your kind of the band limits,

1506
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:44,040
is referred as the Nyquist rate, or Nyquist condition.

1507
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,660
I mean, this is Nyquist rate,

1508
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:48,920
and if your sampling rate is larger than that,

1509
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,960
this is called Nyquist condition.

1510
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,700
You need to satisfy the Nyquist condition

1511
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:55,620
to make sure this measure can be used

1512
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:58,940
to perfectly reconstruct the original analog signal.

1513
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:01,860
In other words, avoid aliasing in the sampled images.

1514
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:03,740
Sorry, sampled signals, right?

1515
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:09,740
And I think we didn't talk about folding frequency,

1516
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:14,260
but actually Nyquist rate is the most important thing.

1517
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:16,220
And the highest frequency,

1518
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:19,940
which is the upper limit of your spectrum,

1519
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:21,660
is usually called Nyquist frequency,

1520
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:23,660
since it determines the minimum sampling frequency.

1521
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:26,180
So basically, what you need to do is say,

1522
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:27,860
if I want you to do sampling,

1523
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:30,180
you need first look at the analog signal,

1524
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,100
work out the spectrum of it,

1525
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,460
and that's how you can determine the Wm.

1526
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:36,300
So once you determine the Wm,

1527
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,780
times two is going to give you the Nyquist rate.

1528
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:42,260
And if your sampling rate is beyond that Nyquist rate,

1529
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:45,060
that means it satisfies the Nyquist condition.

1530
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:46,900
So this is basically what we mean

1531
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:50,740
by kind of fully sampled or over-sampled.

1532
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:51,940
If it's beyond the Nyquist rate,

1533
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:53,780
that's over-sampled signals.

1534
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:55,860
So sampling theory is very important,

1535
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:59,580
and this is also relevant or related

1536
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:02,340
to the up-sampling and down-sampling things,

1537
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:03,500
like multi-rate processing,

1538
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,820
because here, the only thing is that

1539
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:09,580
the analog signal can be considered as infinitely large rate.

1540
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:11,660
But of course, later, when we say multi-rate,

1541
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:12,940
we're talking about finite rate

1542
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:15,860
between two different discrete signals.

1543
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:19,100
But the sampling process will be the bridge

1544
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:21,380
to kind of connect the analog signal

1545
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:23,700
to the discrete signal we are talking about.

1546
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:27,220
So make sure you know the Nyquist rate,

1547
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:29,820
Nyquist condition, and also how to make sure

1548
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:30,860
there's no aliasing.

1549
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:32,260
This is the important thing.

1550
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:35,060
Yeah, so Nyquist rate is this guy.

1551
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:37,140
The minimum sampling rate you need

1552
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:39,900
to satisfy the aliasing-free condition.

1553
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:42,020
So two times your band limits,

1554
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:43,420
this is called Nyquist rate.

1555
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:47,940
Now, after we talk about DTFT,

1556
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:50,180
we say that, well, DTFT, because it gives you

1557
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:53,820
still a continuous spectrum,

1558
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:57,660
which is hard to store and process in digital device.

1559
01:29:57,660 --> 01:30:00,500
So in practice, people actually more prefer

1560
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,700
to use DFT, discrete Fourier transform.

1561
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,700
The difference will be that if you apply DFT,

1562
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,620
you will have a discrete spectrum,

1563
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,860
rather than a continuous spectrum.

1564
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:13,340
And DFT is always a square transform.

1565
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:17,620
In other words, if your input signal has endpoints,

1566
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:20,700
your output DFT will also have endpoints.

1567
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:25,140
That's why we always specify the DFT as an endpoint DFT.

1568
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:26,980
And also these endpoints is corresponding

1569
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:28,780
to how many inputs you have,

1570
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:30,940
how many points in your input signal.

1571
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:34,100
So you need to know the forward DFT

1572
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:35,540
and also the inverse DFT.

1573
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:40,500
So the analog form, sorry, the analytical form is this way,

1574
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,340
is this form.

1575
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:44,180
And for both of inverse and the forward transform,

1576
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:46,060
they are summation, because nothing to do

1577
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:47,500
with continuous signal anymore.

1578
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:51,140
Both of the spectrum and the signal are discrete.

1579
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:52,540
So you just need to do summation,

1580
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:56,100
and the summation is always going from zero to N minus one.

1581
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:01,740
So in the DFT, we have a very important concept,

1582
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,460
it's called resolution.

1583
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:05,700
I hope you understand what is the resolution

1584
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,220
when we talk about DFT.

1585
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:08,940
It's going to depend on two things.

1586
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:11,660
First one is the sampling frequency,

1587
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:14,740
and also the number of points.

1588
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:19,460
So basically you can try to use a more point DFT

1589
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:23,540
to increase, I mean, improve the frequency,

1590
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:24,620
improve the resolution,

1591
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:27,140
but the quantity will be decreased.

1592
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:29,060
In other words, the smaller the quantity,

1593
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,860
the better resolution you have.

1594
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:31,980
This is what you are doing.

1595
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:36,300
So to do so, you can try to do zero padding of your signals

1596
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:41,040
and then use a larger N when you apply the DFT.

1597
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,020
So this is how you can do it.

1598
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:45,260
And you should be able to work out the resolution.

1599
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:46,620
If I give you, for example,

1600
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:49,580
I tell you that signal is sampled at a certain frequency,

1601
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:51,740
so this will be the FT,

1602
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:56,180
and I tell you that the DFT will have 1,025 points,

1603
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:58,500
so this one becomes your N.

1604
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:02,620
So you need to make sure you can work out the resolution

1605
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:03,460
in a corresponding way,

1606
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:07,340
which is the FS or FT divided by the number of points.

1607
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,820
So make sure you know what we mean by resolution,

1608
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:12,920
and you can extract the information

1609
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,380
from the description of the question,

1610
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:16,920
where to extract that frequency,

1611
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:18,380
where to extract that point.

1612
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:22,620
And also, this number is the smaller, the better,

1613
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:23,920
the smaller, the higher frequency,

1614
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,420
sorry, the higher resolution.

1615
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:30,580
And the last but not least, DFT is often,

1616
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:32,800
I mean, this DFT is good for analysis,

1617
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,940
but in practical deployment,

1618
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:37,460
people always do FFT, Fast Fourier Transform,

1619
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:40,820
because these two are exactly the same.

1620
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:42,620
It's going to give you some speed up

1621
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:44,340
and give you the exact same result.

1622
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:47,020
So in practice, all people will do FFT.

1623
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,380
But when people write down the formulation,

1624
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:51,980
they will do DFT, because they're easier.

1625
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:55,140
So that's actually the, you know,

1626
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:58,780
because DFT is more theoretical presentable,

1627
01:32:58,780 --> 01:32:59,700
this is actually the reason

1628
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,140
why we love to use this for analysis.

1629
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:06,620
And another aspect is that because this DFT itself,

1630
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:09,420
it's a kind of n point DFT,

1631
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:13,400
one can represent the entire transform as a matrix.

1632
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:16,960
All right, and this matrix will always be square.

1633
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,340
So it's like n by n matrix, right?

1634
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:24,340
And this matrix is nothing but involving a base,

1635
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:27,260
which is e to the power of j two pi divided by n,

1636
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:31,260
times your, sorry, two power of i minus one

1637
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:32,100
times j minus one.

1638
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:35,680
So in other words, you can represent every element

1639
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:38,720
of this matrix as this form, right?

1640
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,200
And this form, let me use a pointer here.

1641
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,720
This form will be nothing but exponential

1642
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,940
of the base elements here.

1643
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:49,220
So these base elements will be only depends on n, right?

1644
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:51,660
The larger the n, the smaller the face.

1645
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:56,360
But you just keep exponentially using the coordinates

1646
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:59,400
of i and j to form the actual elements, right?

1647
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:04,080
That's how you can form the entire DFT matrix if you want.

1648
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,600
And why we want to use the repetition of the matrix

1649
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:11,120
is because if you represent the DFT using the matrix,

1650
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:15,400
the entire forward DFT can be easily represented

1651
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:19,320
as a matrix multiplied by the input vector, right?

1652
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,620
Your x will be your input vector, which is also n point.

1653
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:24,640
And you multiply by this n by a matrix,

1654
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:27,880
you will get another n dimensional signal.

1655
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,960
And this signal will be the spectrum, right?

1656
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,040
DFT spectrum.

1657
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:35,440
So that's how you can easily get the spectrum from the x.

1658
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,380
Right, so in this case, you can avoid writing

1659
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:40,140
the entire summation, right?

1660
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:43,520
That's why people usually use this matrix vector form.

1661
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,740
All right, and same for inverse DFT, right?

1662
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:48,320
The inverse DFT is another matrix.

1663
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:52,040
And this matrix, in fact, is the direct inverse

1664
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:54,180
of the forward DFT.

1665
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:57,640
So these two are exactly the inverse of the matrix.

1666
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:01,180
You can show that this matrix itself is always full rank.

1667
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:03,960
So inverse always exists.

1668
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:06,120
In fact, this matrix is orthogonal, right?

1669
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:09,000
If you try every column of the matrix

1670
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,200
are orthogonal to each other.

1671
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,240
So it's actually orthonormal,

1672
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:14,560
not only orthonormal matrix, right?

1673
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,440
So if you have this, okay, no.

1674
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,240
I mean, you have to scale it, right?

1675
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,120
You have to do one over square root of n,

1676
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,560
otherwise it's not orthonormal.

1677
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,280
But orthogonal, all right?

1678
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,560
A orthogonal matrix always have inverse

1679
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:31,560
and this inverse becomes the inverse DTFT matrix, all right?

1680
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:34,960
So this is why you can come up

1681
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,800
with this easy representation of the DFT and inverse DFT.

1682
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,440
Okay?

1683
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:43,320
And actually the inverse DFT can be also easily computed

1684
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,140
as the Hermitian transpose

1685
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:47,800
due to the structure of your DFT.

1686
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,900
So it makes the inversion even easier, right?

1687
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,320
Okay?

1688
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:56,040
But actually, don't worry too much about this.

1689
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,580
Even if you don't know the matrix form, right?

1690
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:01,200
If you know the analytic form, you should be okay.

1691
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,480
I mean, because anyway, you just need to write

1692
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:06,040
the summation instead of the matrix vector multiplication.

1693
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:08,060
They are equivalent, right?

1694
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:10,240
Okay?

1695
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,100
And we also say that, well,

1696
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:15,320
without talking, before talking about multi-rate, right?

1697
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:19,240
Remember, without the multi-rate, rate change,

1698
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:22,280
we can assume that the system we're talking about

1699
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:24,800
is LTI system, which stands for linear

1700
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,960
time-invariant system.

1701
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,240
And for this kind of system,

1702
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:31,440
we will have a so-called transfer function

1703
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,440
to represent the entire system.

1704
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,240
So what is this transfer function?

1705
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,060
Transfer function is nothing but your

1706
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:39,820
spectrum of Y divided by spectrum of X, right?

1707
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:41,480
That's your transfer function.

1708
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:44,240
So, depends on the transfer function,

1709
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:47,800
you can actually categorize the system

1710
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,440
into either, let's say,

1711
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,280
you have two way to categorize the system.

1712
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:55,760
One is look at the time domain of the transfer function,

1713
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,080
which is the impulse response, right?

1714
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,760
By looking at how many components you have

1715
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,280
in the impulse response.

1716
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,960
If you have finite impulse response,

1717
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,620
this is called FIR system, all right?

1718
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:10,660
So, you know that in the transfer function,

1719
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:13,160
you should have only the numerator, right?

1720
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:16,000
The denominator should be one, in this case.

1721
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,480
And this can be implemented using

1722
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:21,680
a non-recursive block diagram, right?

1723
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,560
Because you don't have to pass your Y back to the system.

1724
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,240
Remember, all of this denominator

1725
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:31,480
are coming from the past Y outputs, right?

1726
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:33,400
If it's only one, that means you don't have to use

1727
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:37,000
the past time outputs, then there's no recursion

1728
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,960
in your block diagram.

1729
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,720
But there's another kind of transfer function,

1730
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,560
which is the opposite of FIR,

1731
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,160
means that you will have infinitely many impulse response,

1732
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:49,380
it's called IIR, and the actual implementation

1733
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:51,360
will be a recursive block diagram.

1734
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:52,880
So that's the difference.

1735
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,160
Categorize according to the time domain impulse response.

1736
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:58,880
That's one way to categorize the system.

1737
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,460
There's another way to categorize the system,

1738
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:02,960
but instead, time domain, you should look

1739
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,760
at the frequency response of your system, right?

1740
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:11,760
So, you can actually kind of classify your shape

1741
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:14,760
based on the magnitude function,

1742
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,200
which is like the absolute value, right?

1743
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,760
You can also categorize it in terms of the phase.

1744
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:22,540
So, according to the magnitude,

1745
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:24,960
we have learned basically low pass,

1746
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,920
high pass, band pass, or band stop, right?

1747
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,800
So, nothing to do with the phase, but the magnitude.

1748
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,880
Depends on where are the pass band, where are the stop band.

1749
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:37,480
You can actually have these four kind of filters, right?

1750
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:41,040
So, basically these filters will also use them for later,

1751
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,240
like filter banks.

1752
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:45,160
But for all of these filters, you need to specify,

1753
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,900
for example, here, what is the color frequency, right?

1754
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:50,300
The color frequency will be important

1755
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,580
to define, like low pass, high pass.

1756
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:54,700
And for band pass, you need two.

1757
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:59,060
You need WC1 and WC2 to determine where is this pass band,

1758
01:38:59,060 --> 01:38:59,900
right?

1759
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,300
So, once you have those parameters,

1760
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:04,400
you can specify the type of filters you are talking about.

1761
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,240
All right?

1762
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:09,220
And then, we talk about that in practice, right?

1763
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:13,100
All of these so-called low pass filter are ideal filter,

1764
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:16,260
because you are suddenly changed from pass band

1765
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:20,500
to stop band without a set of kind of transition period.

1766
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,540
Right?

1767
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:25,060
But in practice, we never have this ideal filter.

1768
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:27,740
So, in practice, if because you are implementing

1769
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:29,900
the filters using, let's say, FIR,

1770
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:32,340
you will end up with something like this, right?

1771
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:35,600
In other words, from your pass band to stop band,

1772
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,480
there will be a transition band,

1773
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:40,800
which is coming from the pass band to stop band, right?

1774
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,020
So, your transition band will be non-zero,

1775
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:46,540
and you need two frequencies to specify

1776
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:48,260
where is this transition band,

1777
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:51,780
which are the omega P and omega S.

1778
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:52,620
All right?

1779
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,420
If it's ideal filter, that's going to be the same, right?

1780
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:57,020
You've got zero kind of transition width.

1781
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:57,860
All right?

1782
01:39:57,860 --> 01:40:00,180
And also, besides the transition,

1783
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:03,340
there's another phenomenon that could appear

1784
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:05,300
in the non-ideal filter.

1785
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,300
That is the repose, right?

1786
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:10,120
So, there could be some small kind of perturbations

1787
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:11,700
from the ideal pass band.

1788
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:13,600
For example, ideally, there should be one,

1789
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,540
but in practice, there's always some values

1790
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:18,120
alternating between one plus delta P

1791
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:19,800
and one minus delta P, right?

1792
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:22,760
So, this is actually the actual fluctuation you will have.

1793
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,120
So, similarly for stop band,

1794
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,600
you will also have some fluctuation here.

1795
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,960
Ideal pass filter is always one, right, for pass band.

1796
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:31,240
So, that's the difference.

1797
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:32,640
You need to know the difference,

1798
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:37,640
and also, when we design the filters,

1799
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,800
you need to know what is the objective

1800
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,960
when we design the filter, right?

1801
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:45,440
So, basically, you need to somehow come up

1802
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,480
with a realizable transfer function,

1803
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,320
which is not arbitrary.

1804
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:52,040
You have to use this kind of a numerator,

1805
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:56,460
denominator fix to approximate a given frequency spectrum,

1806
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:58,440
so some frequency response.

1807
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,560
So, in other words, all of this so-called filter design

1808
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,520
is about what is the best approximation

1809
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,440
given a certain amount of orders, right,

1810
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,680
certain amount of degree of freedoms.

1811
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:11,280
So, and also, there could be FIR, there could be IRR.

1812
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:14,320
So, for this course, I'm gonna limit you to FIR, right?

1813
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:17,480
IRR, I think Lin is gonna talk about it in the second part.

1814
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:22,260
But basically, you need to make sure

1815
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:26,200
that your design kind of a function

1816
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,060
will have a good approximation

1817
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:31,040
of the objective, intended specification.

1818
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:36,200
And by the problem is that, you know,

1819
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:39,320
how can we come up with a realizable approximation, right?

1820
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:43,120
So, we actually learned only one method for this class.

1821
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:45,160
I removed the other two, but only one method

1822
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,020
that is windowing approach, right?

1823
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:51,340
So, windowing approach, the idea is to use

1824
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:53,500
a low-pass filter, which is like a window,

1825
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:57,600
to limit your filter design, right,

1826
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,000
which is, oh, sorry, not actually a low-pass filter.

1827
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,600
It's actually a limited window in the time domain

1828
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:05,000
to constrain your number of impulse

1829
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,640
from infinity now to a finite number of impulse, right?

1830
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:12,560
So, in this case, coming from a windowing function,

1831
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,420
you are going to talk about a spectrum,

1832
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:17,400
which is something like a zinc function, right?

1833
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:20,360
But of course, you can tell that this function itself

1834
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:22,040
will be non-causal, right,

1835
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:24,320
and there will be infinity non-range.

1836
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,040
So, in this case, you actually need

1837
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:28,120
to come up with a finite duration,

1838
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,920
which is specified by the window,

1839
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,360
and also, you should do some kind of a shift

1840
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:35,840
to approximate the whole thing to a causal system, right?

1841
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,680
So, these are two things you need to do

1842
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:39,360
for your windowing kind of function,

1843
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,040
but for the window function,

1844
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:42,760
you need to understand what's the objective,

1845
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:45,520
which is going to minimize the mean square errors

1846
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,920
when we do approximation,

1847
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:49,760
and you need to specify where the window is, right?

1848
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,260
The lens, the shift, and that's going to determine

1849
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:55,120
your specific windows that are going to apply, right?

1850
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:57,200
But I think for windowing approach,

1851
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:00,120
you just need to know the kind of the rough idea.

1852
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,680
I probably will not test it on how

1853
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:03,560
to exactly implement windows,

1854
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:05,600
but you need to know what's the philosophy

1855
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,140
of this windowing approach.

1856
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:09,920
What's the objective, and what's the limitation, right?

1857
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,560
These are something you need to know for a window approach.

1858
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:13,900
But that will be the only approach

1859
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,220
we learn for filter design, right?

1860
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:18,220
And you don't have to consider other approaches.

1861
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:21,460
For that one, I can promise, okay?

1862
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:24,180
So now, after that, we say that,

1863
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:26,380
well, you can actually represent a system

1864
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:29,860
using a transfer function, using an impulse response,

1865
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:32,380
but you can also use a graph or diagram

1866
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:34,300
to represent your system, right?

1867
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:36,280
The idea is that if you have this diagram,

1868
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:39,760
it's easy for implementation in the end, right?

1869
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,520
So give you some kind of easy to write down

1870
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:45,720
the computational algorithm by simply inspection,

1871
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,720
and also you can analyze the block diagram

1872
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,480
to determine the relationship.

1873
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:52,940
So basically, we're going to use the components like this,

1874
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:56,360
including addition, multiplication, delay,

1875
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:59,680
to implement some of the system we have learned, right?

1876
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:04,120
And you may need to, first of all, like a given,

1877
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:06,960
let's say if I give you a block diagram like this,

1878
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:10,280
you need to tell me what exactly is the relationship

1879
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:12,120
between the X and Y, right?

1880
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:14,000
So you may have some question like this,

1881
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I give you a block diagram.

1882
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,380
Of course, I will specify what are the building blocks,

1883
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:21,580
for example, addition, multiplication,

1884
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:22,960
the ratio will be given,

1885
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:25,400
and amplification also, the ratio will be given,

1886
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,880
but you need to come up with multiple equations.

1887
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,120
For example, these are the equations

1888
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:33,680
describing the key points, right, the W1, W2, W3.

1889
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:35,960
And finally, I will ask you to write,

1890
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,280
give me the, maybe the transfer function,

1891
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:41,060
or the impulse response of the entire system.

1892
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:44,540
So you need to know how can you link the X to Y,

1893
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:46,720
or link the Y to X, right?

1894
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:49,720
The way to do that is by first writing down

1895
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:52,160
all of this intermediate equation, right,

1896
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,060
describing the junction here,

1897
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:56,760
and somehow trying to cancel the variables, right,

1898
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,440
because all of this W1, W2, W3

1899
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,320
are the intermediate variables.

1900
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:04,460
So they shouldn't be there for your .xy transfer function.

1901
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:07,640
So you need to, making use of this multiple equation,

1902
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,720
and cancel them, right?

1903
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,700
And eventually, you should give me something like this,

1904
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:15,360
right, you should somehow end up with the only,

1905
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:19,040
or direct relationship between X and Y, right?

1906
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:22,860
So after that, you should be able to do a Y divided by X,

1907
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:25,240
and that's how you can come up with the transfer function,

1908
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:27,640
like the, in the Z transform, right?

1909
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:32,240
So you may have some question like this, okay?

1910
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:36,400
And one direction is that given the block diagram,

1911
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,240
derive the transfer function, okay?

1912
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:42,360
So I expect all of you can do it, all right?

1913
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:44,040
So if you don't do, if you cannot do it,

1914
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,120
refer to example, right,

1915
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:47,840
because the way to solve that is always the same.

1916
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,560
You look at the junctions,

1917
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:52,160
you work out multiple equation, cancel each other,

1918
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:55,860
only leave the X and Y in the final representation.

1919
01:45:56,740 --> 01:45:58,740
And that equation will be easily,

1920
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:02,020
you can divide it and form the XZ, all right?

1921
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:05,180
Okay, so if you're not familiar with that,

1922
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:06,060
look at this example,

1923
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:08,640
look at the example we have in the notes.

1924
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:11,780
And I mean, this is pretty much what I expect you to know,

1925
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:16,060
right, block diagram interpretation, right?

1926
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:19,080
And then, you know, another important aspect is the phase,

1927
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:21,040
right, we say that in practice,

1928
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,220
we may not have like a zero phase filter

1929
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:25,940
due to the fact that we're using FIR,

1930
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:29,380
but we always wish the phase to be linear, right?

1931
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:30,900
I think I showed some example in the lecture

1932
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:33,160
that if the filter is not linear phase,

1933
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:34,880
you can have some distortion,

1934
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:37,700
and you can make the whole thing like time vary, okay?

1935
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:41,980
So how to make sure that FIR is linear phase?

1936
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:45,380
There are, remember there are two conditions for symmetric,

1937
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:49,300
right, all symmetric, even symmetric for FIR, okay?

1938
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:52,980
And also, depends on how many degree,

1939
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:55,260
how many order you have, right?

1940
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:57,380
Even M is even, M is odd,

1941
01:46:57,380 --> 01:47:01,040
we will have, you know, four type of filters

1942
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:04,380
that could be linear phase, all right?

1943
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:05,900
So in total, there are four types,

1944
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:10,620
but they are either forming a even symmetric kind of FIR

1945
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:13,060
or all symmetric FIR.

1946
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:16,940
So either way, but these two conditions together

1947
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:19,460
are equivalent to linear phase.

1948
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:22,220
In other words, the linear phase could indicate

1949
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:25,660
either way, right, either symmetric or anti-symmetric.

1950
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:28,920
But together, you know, if you have either

1951
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:31,440
the even symmetric or all symmetric,

1952
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,820
it's going to be necessary and sufficient

1953
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:37,300
to say that this FIR is linear phase, okay?

1954
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:39,500
So I hope you can understand the relationship.

1955
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,940
For example, if I say, hey, this filter,

1956
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:46,520
I give you a FIR, I say this filter is linear phase.

1957
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:47,920
You have to try both.

1958
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,680
You have to try both the anti-symmetric and the symmetric

1959
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,640
before making a conclusion, right?

1960
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:56,320
So if either of them somehow give you the answer,

1961
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,280
that should be a valid answer.

1962
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:01,880
So I think that hopefully give you some idea, right?

1963
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:05,160
But if you want, if you are going to check

1964
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:09,640
whether an FIR is a linear phase or not, right,

1965
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:12,020
as long as one of the conditions satisfy,

1966
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:14,860
you can say that the FIR is a linear phase

1967
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:17,220
because it's a necessary condition, right?

1968
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:20,220
Sorry, it's a sufficient condition, okay?

1969
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:24,060
All right, so basically there's only four types.

1970
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:27,340
Just need to make sure what's how you can check

1971
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:29,020
FIR is a linear phase, right?

1972
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:31,180
And if I say it's a linear phase,

1973
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:33,860
can you work out the equivalent condition

1974
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:36,320
on the coefficients of the FIR?

1975
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:40,040
These will be two kind of questions I may give, all right?

1976
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:42,220
So like I said, right, depends on whether

1977
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:43,820
it's a symmetric, anti-symmetric,

1978
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:46,460
depends on the length, is order, even if you have four types

1979
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:48,860
but basically I think the symmetric and anti-symmetric,

1980
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:50,540
this is the most important thing, right?

1981
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:52,900
Make sure you know how to write down the equation

1982
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:55,180
for symmetric and anti-symmetric.

1983
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:57,660
That's how you can form the bunch of equations

1984
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:59,300
to solve the coefficients, right?

1985
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:04,740
All right, and I think this is a table

1986
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:06,100
that you could refer to.

1987
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:10,060
I mean, it just tell you that if it's each type, right,

1988
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:12,240
what is the corresponding kind of phase term?

1989
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:14,400
But anyway, the phase term will be linear, right?

1990
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,800
But of course, the form will be different.

1991
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,680
It's optional, I mean, I won't really ask you

1992
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:20,640
to memorize it but you should be aware

1993
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,300
that there are four types, right?

1994
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,920
Okay, now we talk about, we are moving

1995
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,560
to kind of a party phase, right?

1996
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:30,280
We say, well, FIR can be decomposed

1997
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:33,200
into a party phase representation, right?

1998
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:38,200
So party phase is one way to decompose direct FIR

1999
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:41,240
into multiple branches, remember?

2000
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:46,240
So every branch, they can have a party phase decomposition.

2001
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:49,640
And if you have L branch in total, okay,

2002
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:52,320
your HZ, I mean, your transfer function

2003
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:55,920
can be represented as the summation,

2004
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:59,520
of course, with time delay, over all the branches, right?

2005
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,720
So this EM, well, EM will be the corresponding

2006
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:06,560
transfer function for branches zero, branch one,

2007
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,460
all the way to branch L minus one, right?

2008
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:11,680
So the overall transfer function will be the summation

2009
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:15,420
of the entire L branches of party phase, right?

2010
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:18,260
So the idea of doing that is to reduce, basically,

2011
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:22,560
the computational complexity for every branch, all right?

2012
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:24,420
So, and then you should be able to derive

2013
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:27,780
what is this EM, right, in every branch.

2014
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:29,560
But most importantly, I think party phase

2015
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:31,340
is linked to the multirate processing

2016
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:33,920
because multirate processing, it give you a natural way

2017
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:37,260
to decompose a signal into every branch.

2018
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:39,660
Every branch can be further down-sampled

2019
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:43,000
to the lower rate to save the computational resource, right?

2020
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:47,020
And that's where we followed by talking about

2021
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:49,020
the interpolation and down-sampling,

2022
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:50,660
interpolation and decimation, right?

2023
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:53,460
So we first say that, well, actually,

2024
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:55,940
after all of this block diagram, right,

2025
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:59,220
we're going from a single rate to multirate.

2026
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:02,660
And multirate, the idea is to change the rate

2027
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:05,380
either to higher rate or lower rate, okay?

2028
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:07,460
So basically, there are two possible change.

2029
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:09,700
If you want to go up, you are going to talk

2030
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:12,100
about up-sampling and interpolation, all right?

2031
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:15,340
So this is actually the interpolation system

2032
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:18,380
where interpolation must have up-sampling

2033
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:21,800
followed by a low-pass filter, okay, the order matters.

2034
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:23,620
For interpolation, a low-pass filter

2035
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:26,920
must be after the up-sampling, all right?

2036
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:29,020
The reason, we already explained, right,

2037
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:31,700
the reason is to kill all of these duplicates

2038
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:33,800
when you do the up-sampling, right?

2039
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:36,400
You only want to keep the baseband waveform,

2040
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,160
not the duplicates.

2041
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:41,040
So you will first do up-sampling,

2042
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,240
which will give you duplicates and you kill them

2043
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:46,000
by the follow-up reconstruction filter, right?

2044
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,200
So this is actually the filter we're talking about.

2045
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:51,640
And like I mentioned, you need to know exactly

2046
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:55,440
the how to derive or determine this low-pass filter.

2047
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:59,020
So low-pass filter will be, have a color frequency,

2048
01:51:59,020 --> 01:52:03,160
which depends on the rate of your up-sampling, right?

2049
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,800
So if this is eye time of up-sampling,

2050
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:08,600
your color frequency will be pi divided by.

2051
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:14,240
So the more you up-sampled, the narrower your band will be,

2052
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:15,060
which makes sense, right?

2053
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:17,160
If you have a high number of up-sampling,

2054
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:18,600
you have more duplicates.

2055
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:22,640
So you have to cut the frequency more aggressively.

2056
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:26,400
So this pi over eye will be smaller, right?

2057
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:31,400
And of course, this one really doesn't matter

2058
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:33,680
because you need to have some scale

2059
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:36,120
to compensate the energy loss.

2060
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:38,640
So ideally, you can make C equal to I,

2061
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:40,520
but the change will only be the scale, right?

2062
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,760
It doesn't really change the waveform.

2063
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:45,280
But by doing so, your output spectrum

2064
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:46,960
will have the following relationship.

2065
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,840
So this is what I'm talking about

2066
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:50,600
as the frequency relationship

2067
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:55,560
between input and output of the interpolation, right?

2068
01:52:55,560 --> 01:53:00,560
So similarly, you should also kind of

2069
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:04,960
be able to work out the time domain relationship, right?

2070
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,640
So time domain relationship will be

2071
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:10,200
the kind of the convolution of your H and the V.

2072
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:13,800
Remember, the V here is after up-sampling, right?

2073
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:15,240
And what happens with up-sampling?

2074
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:19,080
Up-sampling will make the XK to be the, sorry,

2075
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:22,040
well, make the VKI equal to XK.

2076
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:25,380
So here, the I will affect the scaling of the function,

2077
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:29,800
right, sorry, the scaling of the signal, right?

2078
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:33,520
So in this case, you can substitute this X back to the V.

2079
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,400
You can work out the entire time domain relationship

2080
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:40,240
from the beginning to all the way the output, right?

2081
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:43,320
So you can refer to the table I actually stated

2082
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:46,400
in lecture five, which give you the four relationship,

2083
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:49,400
like up-sampling, interpolation,

2084
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:50,800
down-sampling, and decimation.

2085
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,800
So for every pair, you need to know

2086
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:55,680
both time domain and the frequency domain, right?

2087
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:57,680
So this is something I need you to know.

2088
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:01,080
Okay, this is by up-substituting the X

2089
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:03,360
is going to give you the overall relationship.

2090
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:05,400
So this will be the mathematic expression

2091
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:08,760
for the time domain of interpolation, right?

2092
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:13,060
And just now, this is the frequency response,

2093
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:17,360
frequency relationship for the interpolation, right?

2094
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:19,320
Okay, so these are the two pairs.

2095
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:20,920
Now, same for decimation, right?

2096
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:23,840
The decimation, the order will be the opposite.

2097
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:27,320
You need to first apply the anti-aliasing filter,

2098
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:31,040
which is a low-pass filter, before down-sampling, right?

2099
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,400
The idea is to prevent aliasing,

2100
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:36,360
and aliasing is prevented by cutting the frequency,

2101
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:38,380
make sure there's no overlap.

2102
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:42,460
So this anti-aliasing must be before down-sampling.

2103
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:45,540
Because if you don't do that, the overlapping happens.

2104
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:48,480
You will be not able to resolve the overlapping part.

2105
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:51,440
So even if you do low-pass filter after that,

2106
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:52,880
the overlapping already happens.

2107
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:55,680
So aliasing is already distorting your signal.

2108
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:57,640
So in this case, low-pass filter

2109
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:00,200
must be before down-sampling.

2110
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,120
But of course, this low-pass filter

2111
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:05,660
will also depend on the down-sampling ratio, right?

2112
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:09,080
So in this case, I'll give you some kind of visual example

2113
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:11,240
what happened for the down-sampling, right?

2114
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:14,920
If you, there are two ways to interpret this process.

2115
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:17,300
So first way, one way to do that

2116
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:22,300
is to directly view this process to the omega y, right?

2117
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:24,340
So like I mentioned, you can view

2118
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:27,340
the entire kind of down-sampling

2119
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:30,180
as the stretching of the signal, right?

2120
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:35,180
So initially, your signal is limited by pi over four, right?

2121
01:55:35,380 --> 01:55:37,460
But by up down-sampling by four times,

2122
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:40,380
you are going to stretch the signal to four times

2123
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:42,780
such that your baseband will be

2124
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:45,020
stretching from pi over four to pi, right?

2125
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:47,380
So here, maybe I will do a pen here.

2126
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:51,020
So this is like pi here, right?

2127
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:54,300
So one way to view that is by stretching your signal here

2128
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:57,580
from pi over four to pi, right?

2129
01:55:57,580 --> 01:55:59,500
So the ratio of the stretching of the signal

2130
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:02,460
is equal to the number, ratio of the down-sampling.

2131
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:03,980
So this is one way to view it.

2132
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:08,460
If you view so, you are directly converting omega x

2133
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:10,580
to omega y, right?

2134
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:11,840
That's the first way.

2135
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,460
The other way is that stay in the omega x, right?

2136
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:17,500
Don't change the omega, still doing the omega x.

2137
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:22,060
But considering, you know, like a duplicate

2138
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:25,240
all the way from your baseband,

2139
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:28,620
the first duplicate, second duplicate, and third duplicate.

2140
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:33,020
So you will form entirely four copy of your baseband,

2141
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:34,900
depends on how many ratio you have,

2142
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:39,240
to fill up the range from zero to two pi, right?

2143
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:43,580
And then converting the omega from omega x to omega y.

2144
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:47,020
But in this case, your omega must be amplified by four times

2145
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:52,660
In this case, here originally is actually pi over two,

2146
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:55,660
this origin is pi over two, right?

2147
01:56:55,660 --> 01:56:59,220
And after multiplication is going to change to two pi, right?

2148
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:01,220
So the same, you're gonna end up with the

2149
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:03,720
same kind of waveform, by either way.

2150
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:05,160
So it depends on how you wanna view that.

2151
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:06,780
Either way will be the valid way

2152
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:09,340
to kind of view the change of the spectrum, right?

2153
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:11,460
In this down-sampling process.

2154
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:14,880
Okay, so this process is only down-sampling.

2155
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:19,600
Anti-aliasing already happened in this low-pass filter, right?

2156
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:23,560
So if you have originally some kind of larger bandwidth,

2157
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:25,560
your low-pass filter will cut everything, right?

2158
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:27,640
Cut everything beyond pi over four,

2159
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:29,840
so this will be killed, right?

2160
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:33,080
But what is the illustrating here?

2161
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:36,080
This process is just down-sampling, right?

2162
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:39,840
And depends on the ratio, the stretching will be different.

2163
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:44,260
But if your original signal is band limited by pi over four,

2164
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:46,700
you won't have any aliasing, because there's no overlap,

2165
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:49,260
even if you stretch your signal, right?

2166
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:51,660
So here, your low-pass filter will be

2167
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:53,460
cutting off at pi over four.

2168
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:55,980
Or in other words, pi over I, right?

2169
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:58,580
Depends on your I, I mean, sorry, pi over D.

2170
01:57:58,580 --> 01:58:01,120
What D is, the cutoff frequency will be different.

2171
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:03,380
Okay?

2172
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:04,460
Does it make sense?

2173
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:08,900
So you need to clearly indicate what happened

2174
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:10,580
for low-pass and I-pass.

2175
01:58:10,580 --> 01:58:12,500
Okay, I will have one question on that.

2176
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:16,540
So make sure at least you know how to sketch the difference

2177
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:18,540
for down-sampling, for up-sampling,

2178
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:21,460
for anti-aliasing filter, for reconstruction filter.

2179
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:22,300
All right?

2180
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:24,360
Okay?

2181
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:25,180
Make sure you know this.

2182
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:27,420
If anything's unclear, come and ask me.

2183
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:29,400
I'm happy to explain to you, all right?

2184
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:31,620
But you will have one sub-question on this.

2185
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:33,700
I can guarantee, I mean, I already said the question,

2186
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:35,420
so what I'm saying here is serious.

2187
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:39,180
Okay, there will be one question, at least on this part.

2188
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:40,020
Okay?

2189
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:45,860
All right, so this is, okay, so overall,

2190
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:49,080
you need to know the sketch, how things change

2191
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,620
in the spectrum, as well as the mathematic representation.

2192
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:55,860
So make sure you are familiar with all of this.

2193
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:59,060
Basically four sets, what happened if it's only

2194
01:58:59,060 --> 01:59:01,220
up-sampling, what happened is up-sampling

2195
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:04,980
plus reconstruction filter, so in total, interpolation.

2196
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:08,220
And then only down-sampling, and also together

2197
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:11,280
with the anti-aliasing, so in total, the decimation.

2198
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:14,100
So for all of these four, you need to know

2199
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:16,600
time domain plus frequency domain.

2200
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:17,440
All right?

2201
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:19,680
And then it makes your job easier, right,

2202
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:21,600
to work out the mathematic form.

2203
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:24,520
All right?

2204
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:28,140
Now, when we talk about multi-rate, right,

2205
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:29,820
I could give you some question like give you

2206
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:32,860
a block diagram with multiple up-sampling,

2207
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:34,620
down-sampling, low-pass filter.

2208
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:38,580
Sometimes you need to simplify the block diagram, right?

2209
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:41,700
When you say simplify, you have to maybe swap the order

2210
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:44,800
of the up-sampling or maybe down-sampling of the filter.

2211
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:48,020
So the most important property you need to know

2212
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:50,540
is the so-called noble identity, right?

2213
01:59:50,540 --> 01:59:51,660
So what is noble identity?

2214
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:55,260
It's basically the relationship, if you wanna change

2215
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:59,680
the order between the down-sampling and the low-pass filter

2216
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:02,160
or the down-up-sampling with the low-pass filter.

2217
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:06,360
So if you swap the order, how will the low-pass filter

2218
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:07,780
change, right?

2219
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:10,760
This is actually told by the noble identity.

2220
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:14,340
So make sure you know what's the conclusion

2221
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:17,560
and also make sure how you can derive it, okay?

2222
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:18,700
Let me just emphasize this, right?

2223
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:22,680
You need to know how you derive the noble identity.

2224
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:23,920
Okay, which shouldn't be very hard,

2225
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:28,040
but make sure you try all of the derivation, okay?

2226
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:32,640
And make yourself convinced that when you swap the order

2227
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:35,560
between the two, there'll be an exponential term

2228
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:37,580
on the low-pass filter, right?

2229
02:00:37,580 --> 02:00:41,160
Basically, other words, your only goal will be scaled by d,

2230
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:43,840
right, if you change the order of the two.

2231
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:47,080
So make sure you go through the derivation here, okay?

2232
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:49,280
Not just memorize the result, but you need to derive

2233
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:51,100
the whole thing here, okay?

2234
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:56,120
Okay, so like I mentioned, this is also important.

2235
02:00:56,120 --> 02:00:57,080
You know what it means, right?

2236
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:59,040
There will be one question on that for sure.

2237
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:03,820
So if anything unclear, please ask me, okay?

2238
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:05,080
And then filter bank, right?

2239
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:07,400
Filter bank, like I mentioned,

2240
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:09,800
you don't have to deal with the party face,

2241
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:12,760
but you need to know that filter bank

2242
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:16,760
will have two parts, right, which is the analysis part.

2243
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:18,780
So this will be the analysis part,

2244
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:21,400
and there will be a, maybe I changed the pointer, right?

2245
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:22,880
So this will be the analysis part,

2246
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:24,120
there will be a synthesis part,

2247
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:27,760
and in the middle, people can do whatever DSP they like

2248
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:30,600
for every channel specifically, all right?

2249
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:34,040
But what you need to know is that how to construct

2250
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:36,860
a qualified analysis filter bank,

2251
02:01:36,860 --> 02:01:40,800
and also how to construct a synthesis filter bank, right?

2252
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,400
So this is what you need to know.

2253
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:47,100
And how can we divide the signal into different subbands

2254
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:50,160
such that we can also combine them later

2255
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:52,960
to restore the original signal

2256
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:55,160
with the distortion minimized, right?

2257
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:58,280
So this is actually the purpose of designing

2258
02:01:58,280 --> 02:02:00,600
the filter banks, to make sure the signal

2259
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:03,400
can be perfect to reconstruct if possible, right?

2260
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:07,220
So for filter bank, we talk about two scenario.

2261
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:09,440
One is the ideal case, okay?

2262
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,520
Ideal case means your low-pass filter

2263
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:15,900
can be sharp transition directly from passband to stopband.

2264
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:18,960
So we're talking about the filter bank like this,

2265
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:19,920
low-pass filter like this.

2266
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:23,720
So if the, under the ideal case,

2267
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:27,880
you can treat every channel, the low-pass filter, sorry,

2268
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:30,260
the filters to be shifted version

2269
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:33,000
of the prototype low-pass filter, all right?

2270
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,320
So in other words, you only need to specify

2271
02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:38,960
one prototype as your H zero.

2272
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:41,840
Other filters in the channel one, channel two,

2273
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:44,800
all the way to M minus one will be nothing

2274
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:48,820
but a shifted version of your prototype.

2275
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:51,180
So you just need to specify H zero.

2276
02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:53,660
Of course, this frequency shifted,

2277
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:56,100
delay will be nothing but a phase change

2278
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:56,940
in the time domain.

2279
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:59,100
So correspondingly, you should be able

2280
02:02:59,100 --> 02:03:03,780
to work out the relationship in the impulse response, right?

2281
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:08,460
From the prototype to the specific HK, all right?

2282
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:11,620
So, but remember, this is the ideal case,

2283
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:12,860
not for practical case, right?

2284
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:16,460
But for ideal case, this is the way we can construct

2285
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:21,140
a list of filters from H zero to HK, right?

2286
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:25,460
And now, if we are using ideal low-pass filter, right,

2287
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:30,060
the way we can construct the filter band is the following.

2288
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:33,900
You need to do some kind of a phase shift

2289
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:36,980
in the time domain, followed by the prototype filters,

2290
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:38,780
followed by down-sampling, right?

2291
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:41,140
The reason of doing down-sampling is to reduce the rate

2292
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:43,240
to save the computational, I mean,

2293
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:45,460
to improve the efficiency, right?

2294
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:50,060
And by doing so, you can actually generate

2295
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:54,580
the specific spectrum of the signal in a lower rate.

2296
02:03:54,580 --> 02:03:57,980
And then you can do DSP for every channels, right?

2297
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:00,620
But after that, you need another synthesis filter

2298
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:04,580
to combine them together to restore the original signal.

2299
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:06,660
The way we form the synthesis process

2300
02:04:06,660 --> 02:04:10,720
is something symmetric compared to analysis filter, right?

2301
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:15,100
Which is up-sampling first, followed by a low-pass filter,

2302
02:04:15,580 --> 02:04:17,980
followed by another kind of a phase shift,

2303
02:04:17,980 --> 02:04:18,940
but opposite way, right?

2304
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:22,660
You wanna shift the signal back to the specific bandwidth

2305
02:04:22,660 --> 02:04:24,260
and sum them together.

2306
02:04:24,260 --> 02:04:27,940
So this phase shift will be exact opposite

2307
02:04:27,940 --> 02:04:31,180
of the analysis phase shift, right, if you compare the two.

2308
02:04:31,180 --> 02:04:33,220
All right, because one is to shift them

2309
02:04:33,220 --> 02:04:36,140
from the specific band to the base band.

2310
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:39,240
Synthesis will be shifted back to the specific band, right?

2311
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:41,340
So they are actually the opposite.

2312
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:44,900
So by doing so, if you don't do anything in the middle,

2313
02:04:45,580 --> 02:04:48,780
between X and Y, you will be able to get this VN,

2314
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:51,340
which is exactly the same as your XN.

2315
02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:55,340
Maybe with some scaling, but waveform is the same, all right?

2316
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:59,160
But remember, this is your ideal low-pass filter case, okay?

2317
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:02,420
So when you go to exam, please read the question.

2318
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:06,380
Are we talking about ideal filter or practical filter?

2319
02:05:06,380 --> 02:05:09,340
Ideal filter, goal is this formulation, all right?

2320
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:11,520
And you should be able to write every term, right?

2321
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:13,180
How can you derive the G?

2322
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:14,980
How can you determine the rate?

2323
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:17,660
How do you do the phase shift correspondingly?

2324
02:05:17,660 --> 02:05:18,500
All right?

2325
02:05:19,700 --> 02:05:20,900
Okay.

2326
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:24,060
And now, now talking about practical case,

2327
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:26,740
this is where we need the QMF.

2328
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:30,140
All right, so ideal filter band, nothing to do with QMF.

2329
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:32,380
You just need to specify a prototype,

2330
02:05:32,380 --> 02:05:35,140
do a shift, you form the list of filters.

2331
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:38,220
Now, for practical cases, doing that way

2332
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:40,160
will always give you aliasing,

2333
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:42,340
because you cannot have a clear cut

2334
02:05:42,340 --> 02:05:44,820
of the frequency channels, frequency band, right?

2335
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:47,520
So there will be some transition band,

2336
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,980
and how can we use a practical filters,

2337
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:54,900
but still have a result which is aliasing-free?

2338
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:57,380
This is what the QMF is doing, okay?

2339
02:05:57,380 --> 02:06:01,460
So clearly, QMF is to construct a filter band

2340
02:06:01,460 --> 02:06:06,140
using non-ideal filters to get aliasing-free result.

2341
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:07,820
Okay, this is what QMF is doing.

2342
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:12,820
Now, QMF, we will only be learning the two-channel case,

2343
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:16,180
but we say that you can extend it to more channels

2344
02:06:16,180 --> 02:06:19,620
by progressively dividing the frequency bandwidth,

2345
02:06:19,620 --> 02:06:21,440
but just for calculation purpose,

2346
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,420
let's stick to two-channel, right?

2347
02:06:23,420 --> 02:06:27,820
Now, for two-channel filter band,

2348
02:06:27,820 --> 02:06:31,500
you basically need to determine four filters, all right?

2349
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:35,700
Here, the H0, here, the H1, G0, and the G1.

2350
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:37,000
So just now, the student asked me, he said,

2351
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:39,460
hey, why my homework?

2352
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:41,280
I don't call them H0 and H1.

2353
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:43,160
So I can call them anything, for the record.

2354
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:45,560
I can call them A, B, C, D, right?

2355
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:49,500
But you always need four channel, sorry, four filters

2356
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:52,920
to form a two-channel QMF, right?

2357
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:54,960
The name of the filter doesn't matter.

2358
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:58,160
I can call them H, I can call them A, call them B, right?

2359
02:06:58,160 --> 02:07:01,660
But to fully determine a two-channel filter band,

2360
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:05,360
you need four filters, that's for sure, okay?

2361
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:10,400
But for QMF, these four filters are not completely free.

2362
02:07:11,100 --> 02:07:16,080
Okay, there are dependency over the four filters, okay?

2363
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:20,000
This is actually the condition of QMF, all right?

2364
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,960
So you need to know the condition of QMF,

2365
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:25,000
and the condition is actually derived,

2366
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,200
I mean, first is the following, right?

2367
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:32,200
You only need one H to represent all of them

2368
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:35,480
because one H will be able to determine

2369
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:39,840
what is G0, what is G1, and what is H0, what is H1.

2370
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:41,160
But just while we talk about that,

2371
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:43,240
where does this equation come from?

2372
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:45,740
It comes from the fact that the adiabatic term

2373
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:47,320
must be zero, right?

2374
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:50,280
We say that the contribution of the adiabatic term

2375
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:53,060
is the quantity, and we wanna make that quantity to be zero.

2376
02:07:53,060 --> 02:07:56,400
That's how we end up with these four equations, okay?

2377
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:59,080
But these four equations, you can tell that

2378
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:01,720
all of these four filters will be all depends

2379
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:05,920
on this H, so you only need one H.

2380
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:08,200
They can determine all of the four filters, right?

2381
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:12,400
That's what the QMF is talking about, okay?

2382
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:15,260
But all of the four, you should be able to tell that

2383
02:08:15,260 --> 02:08:18,740
the H0 and H1 are symmetric, right?

2384
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:21,840
So one is the mirror symmetric of the others,

2385
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:25,420
and the center point is always pi over two, right?

2386
02:08:25,420 --> 02:08:27,960
You can actually easily tell from these two pairs.

2387
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:30,560
So one is equal to H omega,

2388
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:33,160
and the other one is H omega minus pi, right?

2389
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:35,680
Consider the filters themselves are symmetric.

2390
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:38,800
If you shift by pi, you will form a mirror symmetric

2391
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:42,280
within zero to pi region, all right?

2392
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:47,280
Now, G0 and G1, they will be kind of both symmetric

2393
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:51,280
and plus or minus sign, right?

2394
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:54,640
But minus sign itself will not affect the magnitude, right?

2395
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:56,160
Magnitude is always larger than zero,

2396
02:08:56,160 --> 02:08:59,760
so you also have some kind of symmetric property

2397
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:02,600
of the magnitude of G0 and G1, right?

2398
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:06,240
This is actually what QMF is telling you, right?

2399
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:09,320
But whatever, what is the H0, H omega?

2400
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:11,000
You can determine the H omega,

2401
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,820
and sometimes H omega will be provided by the question,

2402
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:16,160
right, but once you know that,

2403
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:19,120
you need to be able to derive all of the four filters

2404
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:22,140
in this QMF, right, for two channels.

2405
02:09:22,140 --> 02:09:24,600
That's what this part is talking about, right?

2406
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:27,600
And also, if you know the frequency relationship,

2407
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:28,760
you should also be able to tell

2408
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:30,000
the time domain relationship,

2409
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,280
which is nothing but the phase shift,

2410
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:37,280
which is J e to the power of minus J n pi, right,

2411
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,400
in this case, all right?

2412
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:43,380
So this is actually the H.

2413
02:09:43,380 --> 02:09:45,140
You can also work out the G.

2414
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:50,880
So basically, if you have this QMF,

2415
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:54,340
what you can do is using non-ideal filter.

2416
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:55,960
Here, the H is non-ideal filter

2417
02:09:55,960 --> 02:10:00,080
to form a aliasing-free filter bank, right?

2418
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:01,660
This is what the QMF is doing.

2419
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:05,200
So I mean, the reason they can form an aliasing-free result

2420
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:07,440
is not because there's no aliasing in the middle.

2421
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:11,040
It's because the aliasing from the analysis filter

2422
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:15,640
will be somehow canceled by the follow-up interpolation.

2423
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:16,880
All right, so in other words,

2424
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:19,120
it's just because we designed the filter

2425
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:21,760
to perfectly cancel the two components.

2426
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:23,840
That's why we can achieve the final aliasing-free,

2427
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:26,780
but it doesn't mean that there's no aliasing

2428
02:10:26,780 --> 02:10:29,400
after, sorry, after the analysis filter.

2429
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:33,160
So there will be aliasing after an analysis filter.

2430
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:35,400
Okay, that's actually the fact.

2431
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:38,600
But if you do so, the next stage will cancel

2432
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:40,960
whatever error you have in the first stage

2433
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:45,960
to achieve the final result, which is aliasing-free, okay?

2434
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:49,880
And like I said, we only talk about two channels,

2435
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:51,760
and the two channels will be LTI system, right,

2436
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:54,200
because basically the upsampling, downsampling

2437
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:55,080
can be canceled each other,

2438
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:57,920
so it's going to be still a timing-variance system.

2439
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:01,940
All right, so I think that's all I have for the summary.

2440
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:04,680
Basically, everything I cover for my summary,

2441
02:11:04,680 --> 02:11:06,360
they will be tested.

2442
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:09,760
If I didn't cover in my summary, maybe they are not, right?

2443
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:12,120
But anyway, I should specify all of the things

2444
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:13,480
in my lecture already, right,

2445
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:15,720
what are the optional ones, what are compulsory ones.

2446
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:17,980
So whenever I see optional, forget about it,

2447
02:11:17,980 --> 02:11:21,060
it won't be tested, but good for you to know, right?

2448
02:11:21,220 --> 02:11:24,260
So if that's the case, I will end the lecture today,

2449
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:26,220
and I will stay here for some questions.

2450
02:11:26,220 --> 02:11:28,580
If you have any questions, I'm happy to take.

2451
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:30,520
Okay, otherwise, I hope you have a good recess,

2452
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:31,740
and also don't forget homework.

2453
02:11:31,740 --> 02:11:34,500
Okay, homework is due by the end of the recess,

2454
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:36,100
so don't be late.

2455
02:11:36,100 --> 02:11:39,700
And also, by now, we should have all the knowledge

2456
02:11:39,700 --> 02:11:42,540
to solve every question, so you still feel confused

2457
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:45,260
or unclear of the question you've come and asked me.

2458
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:46,080
All right?

2459
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:48,780
Okay, thank you so much, so have a nice recess.

2460
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:50,180
All right, okay, thank you.

2461
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:51,900
Thank you.

2462
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:21,900
Okay.
