1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 If they happen to be free, we will answer questions from students and so on.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 But if you are now happy, now or at least select courses you are selecting, then that's okay.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 It's mainly for the cost-retribution problem.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Of course, if you have other more urgent questions regarding your plans and so on, you may also ask.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 But the main purpose is you all know the recent problem.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 So, although this past few days we worked very hard, and now except a few very popular courses,

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 we still have more students waiting for the rest of the courses, including this one.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Also, I was a little bit surprised about the 6405 natural language processing, which is, you know,

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 there is a small deal with the venue, where you get a special venue interactive like a tutorial room.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 So the capacity remains only like 200.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 But then currently the maximum number is far below that.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 So anyway, for those, if you are very good at programming, you know, Python and so on, and more in the machine learning.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Natural language processing is quite different from signal processing.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 So you see, there are also exposed processing.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 One is more very much related to machine learning.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 This one is more like the hardcore signal processing, the advanced digital signal processing.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Okay, so I think we should start now, since there are students coming and so on.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 So as I say, most of the students here are SPML and the communication engineering, CCA, computer control and automation.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 So these are so-called three programs, more related to like soft science, soft engineering,

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 where the ETE and the PE, the student actually cannot select this one.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Yeah, so we can start now.

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 So first introduce myself.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 So my name is Lin Zhiping.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 This is my context.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I also, I don't know why the projector seems like this.

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Yellow light, I don't know.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 So let's look.

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 There is a, I should bring this down here because, let me see.

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 There is the one with LTCC.

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Okay.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Let me see.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 It's the control button.

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 So there is a button to send all this out.

34
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Let's change this.

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Let me see.

36
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 This should be already on.

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Yeah, this is already down, but then I don't know why, what happened to this.

38
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 There is a yellow light.

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 It's not in my computer.

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Not to be confused, it's probably always there.

41
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Okay.

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 So anyway, sorry, I thought there's a curtain.

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Okay.

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 So let's come back to this.

45
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Don't worry about that because today the section is more like an introduction.

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Let me just go to give you those backgrounds first.

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Let me do this.

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 You already have my context.

49
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Okay.

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 So that's even more useful.

51
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Yeah, make it.

52
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Now, in the past, the lecture sequence is always, you can see here there is a part one,

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 which is more on deterministic signal processing.

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Then in the past several years, there have been a few lecturers teaching this part one.

55
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Change at least.

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Let me see.

57
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I myself, I taught this course for I think five or six years.

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 So you can, some of the contents also undergo certain change, but I will talk about that later.

59
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 But for this part one, in the past six years, it's been changed three times.

60
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 We start with one professor teaching for quite a long time.

61
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 He's a part-time lecturer.

62
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 He retired probably four years ago.

63
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Then after that, taking over by a part-time lecturer, Dr. Zilab.

64
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 He taught for two years.

65
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 That two years is a very difficult time for students taking these courses.

66
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 So don't worry about it.

67
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 If you look back about two or three years back, the past year exam paper, you may find that part very difficult.

68
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 That was said by this Dr. Zilab.

69
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 After two years, he also, he didn't want to teach.

70
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 He said, oh, very difficult to teach, saying so on.

71
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Then from last year, we have a young professor.

72
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 I think many of you should know him in the station project selection.

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 I don't know whether all his projects being taken.

74
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 He proposed many, probably maximum.

75
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Now it's 25.

76
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Even 10 more like today.

77
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 So he's quite familiar with signal processing, machine learning.

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 But at least when he joined last year, I asked him to make this question a little bit easier.

79
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 So that at least last year, he recovered a little bit from two years ago.

80
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And these student find the exam questions quite difficult.

81
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And then this year, we have discussion.

82
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 He also said he may even revise and make it a little bit easier.

83
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 But anyway, you know the course title of this.

84
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 So taking this course like this, not just remember the course code.

85
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 You should know the subject title, which is advanced digital signal processing.

86
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 So having this advanced, we cannot teach something very basic,

87
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 which will be going back to the DSP.

88
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 But there is a relationship.

89
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 So we try to balance by maybe providing more example or technique a little bit slowly and so on.

90
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 In the past years, I never really came here to teach like we want.

91
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 But based on the problems in the past few years,

92
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 and also we find some students, they come to the second part or in the middle,

93
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 and they are finding this course very difficult, challenging.

94
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 But it's already like too late.

95
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 So this year also, it happened to be the course schedule change.

96
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 In the past few years, it's always Friday.

97
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 So Friday is almost, students get used to it already after several days.

98
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 And this happened to be Monday.

99
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 So I decided to give the first week one by myself, other than part two.

100
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Then, since I know this course, the history is better at least.

101
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 So he only started to teach from last year.

102
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Then I thought I would give maybe a more introduction.

103
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And also putting in the so-called requirements and so on.

104
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 I mean, then it's up to you.

105
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Because now, if two days ago, when we had all the course already up to maximum,

106
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 then I will not say anything about a chop and so on.

107
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 But now, as I say, we have the flexibility at least.

108
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 At least some courses.

109
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Then some of you, after the briefing, you'll find this course is useful,

110
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 but really too difficult.

111
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Your background is not enough.

112
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Then, of course, there are two ways.

113
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 If you still decide to take and then you'll find other courses,

114
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 it's not easy to get in.

115
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Anyway, for SPA, ML students, this is the core subject.

116
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 But now we have six to choose from.

117
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Rather than in the past, five out of four, then the choice is more limited.

118
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 And JDP is also proposed by me by adding one more SC since last year.

119
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And we start with this new program, SPML.

120
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 So the main reason I want to highlight this course is we have two parts

121
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 which are quite related, but quite different.

122
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 If you look at the content, then those are highlighted here.

123
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 The part one, roughly about half, six weeks.

124
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 I think today I won't talk too much into the technical part,

125
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 because anyway, after six weeks, probably you forgot at least half of the material.

126
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So when I come back after the recess, I will go back to review.

127
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 So this is deterministic signal.

128
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Later I will talk briefly.

129
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I think most of you should know.

130
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 But the other part two, the one I'm going to teach mainly is statistical signal processing.

131
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Also both are signal processing.

132
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 That's why I put into the same course, we call it advanced digital signal processing.

133
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 But the measures are quite different.

134
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 I won't say which one is more difficult,

135
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 because it's just like you have two branches.

136
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 So if you look at other courses, at least I'm quite familiar with those

137
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 that are related to signal processing and so on.

138
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 So they have some connection.

139
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Usually it's part one easier, then you move on to part two.

140
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 So they are probably the same level of difficulty, but using similar approach.

141
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 For example, on Wednesday I'm teaching another course,

142
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 which is supposed to be PhD and MNC plus MSc.

143
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 And that's called statistical signal processing.

144
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 It's different from here, because statistical signal processing has many different topics.

145
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 But in that course, I also have two parts.

146
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 One is detection, like signal detection.

147
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 The other is signal estimation.

148
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 So you can see the two parts, they are all statistical, so they are quite related.

149
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Usually students at the beginning find estimation a bit difficult,

150
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 but once they learn, then they find detection is maybe similar, because they're both similar.

151
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 But here, because in the past we have quite a number of students

152
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 after spending half of the course, and then they finally learn something,

153
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 like multirate, DSP, field bank, and so on.

154
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Then try to relax a little bit, then come to my part, if I go, even more challenging,

155
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 because there everything is statistical, like probabilities, random process, and so on.

156
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 So this is what I want to highlight, and I also give at least the first lecture,

157
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 which I'm not covering for the whole of today, but at least I will go through some of that, maybe after the break.

158
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 So by the way, here, being with Wang is also good, because of course, different lecturers have different way of teaching.

159
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 But I will say most of the lecturers, including myself, instead of three hours,

160
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 so by the way, undergraduate teaching, every one hour you take a break, so it will be two breaks.

161
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 But here we combine into one bigger block, so we normally take just one break in the middle, maybe 15 minutes.

162
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And then after that, go all the way to 9, so by the way, it should be 9.20,

163
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 but we will see sometime end a little bit early, but surely it's like after 9.

164
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 So just one break. Sometime I'll get more content, then can stay on for a little bit later.

165
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 So it's more like flexible.

166
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Okay, so therefore, in the first hours or so, I will try to give you the first welcome to your study, your journey.

167
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 I assume most of you are the new students.

168
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Of course, some of you already in the second semester or second year, or they might be different study,

169
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 but very small number, the majority is new students.

170
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 So having these, this is roughly the contents.

171
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Some things you will see here, the first six weeks, you will still review maybe half of DSP,

172
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 then after that, go to multiple DSP and filter, filter bank.

173
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Next week, you will also cover this, and so I won't go into what's in this part.

174
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 But then in my part, if you look at the contents, it looks like quite easy, only two main part after the background.

175
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So one is more like linear prediction, which is in the same, so a little bit related to machine learning,

176
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 but not using neural network, it's just use the statistical approach and also optimal linear filter.

177
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 This filter is different from the part one filter, where that's handling deterministic signal,

178
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 where here is from the statistical point of view.

179
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 So yeah, and then similarly power spectrum estimation.

180
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Again, we will be dealing with random signal, looking at behavior of going through a random process,

181
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 and how the frequency content is no longer like looking at sideways, where that belong to the deterministic part.

182
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 So that's about give you overall picture of the relationship.

183
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 But anyway, there are also some common topic, like you must be familiar with signal and system,

184
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 and also filters, which is the centers of the two part.

185
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 And before going further, I think this may be useful for some of you, if you are planning your study.

186
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 I will say in terms of the percentage, now is almost standard for most of the courses,

187
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 except some courses like NLP, actually to me is quite good because no final exam,

188
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 but every week you will have some continuing assessment, like quiz, natural language processing.

189
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And then for most of the other courses, usually they will have more than two continuous assessment.

190
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Because why? Because having two CA means continuous assessment, so it's a short form, because it's 40%.

191
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Because why? Because two CA is a minimum, we cannot do one CA, this is not allowed by NTU.

192
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And then I argue because I'm in charge of the SPML, before it's called SP.

193
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 So most of the SP courses actually have only two continuous assessment.

194
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 So in the same way, it's easier to manage it, because you're, yeah, but on the other hand, each percentage is higher.

195
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 So particularly the quiz, which is my part, part two, it's 20% and you will be held in class, I mean physically here, with 12.

196
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 So last year there was only an offer in one, semester one.

197
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 And then I also do the same because some lecturers, they may not put it at the beginning, but then announce only at a later time.

198
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 And then students sometimes argue, oh I need to go back to China for an interview and so on, or give some reason.

199
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 So for me it's always upfront I say that, so at least I also make later the three NTU do the announcement.

200
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And it will be the same day, same time during the class.

201
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 So we're 12, because we're 12 is Mondays, still at least three weeks from the final exams.

202
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 If Friday, last year is Friday, some students complained about like too late, so I was thinking to bring to week 11.

203
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 But it happened to be now, this year we're having on Monday, so yeah, we're 12 Mondays, still quite a long time to the final exam.

204
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 So please take down this and don't say later argue, say you don't know.

205
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 But for the other, the first part of the CA1, it will be, you can take back home assignments, then you can do it within like two weeks and so on.

206
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 So that part I let Paul Woon to say, usually near the end of his teaching, then can go over to the research suite and then submit.

207
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 But anyway, the timing, let him talk about that next week.

208
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 So my part is this.

209
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 So this, the very basic, yeah.

210
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 So any question?

211
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Oh, we have, yeah, most of the students are doing things like week one, and then gradually they, because there is a video recording.

212
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 So yeah, and then some, you know, you decide maybe not come physically to save the time and so on.

213
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 It's fine.

214
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Anyway, other than quiz, we don't take attendance in view of the very large class, but quiz is very, very essential.

215
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Okay.

216
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 So any question?

217
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 As I say, today I prefer, I prepare quite some basics rather than, you know, going into the technical detail.

218
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Maybe, yeah, I try to cover before taking the brain in the middle.

219
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 So let's look at the book first, because there are two related textbooks, but it was published at different time.

220
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 So this is what Paul Woon, he will teach his part.

221
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Yes, if you look at this book.

222
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 I think our bookstore here, they may also sell this one if you really want to have the hard copy.

223
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 So this is the one.

224
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 The one, yeah, use the title, then the textbook edition.

225
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 It's a very basic book, and this is a good reference.

226
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 It's some Malibu program and so on.

227
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I think Paul Woon will talk more on this.

228
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 But the reason I want to highlight is, unfortunately, that book, it doesn't cover the power spectrum estimation.

229
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 So this is exactly the same book, same author, same title.

230
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 It also called force edition.

231
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And this one you cannot, hard copy at least, cannot buy in Singapore.

232
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 But the library, the reserve, if you go to the, I don't know how many of you, you now have the next generation cards.

233
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 You got it last week.

234
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 So once you have that, you can go to the library.

235
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 The library, mostly now they don't have too many, usually have hard copy book,

236
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 but probably new one getting filled up, those old one.

237
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 But this book, don't worry, I request them to put into the reserve room.

238
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 You know reserve room?

239
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 It's the counter where you cannot, you can only borrow for two hours, usually make photocopy and so on.

240
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 So that book, there are several copy.

241
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 That book contain the power spectrum estimation chapter.

242
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 As I also show you this one.

243
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 But anyway, you look at my lecture notes, normally I give quite detail.

244
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 And also sometimes in the class I can add on some derivation and so on.

245
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 So yeah, just to let you know.

246
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 So these are the, another useful information.

247
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 So this is the book.

248
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Let me see what else.

249
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Covering page, which is, yeah, okay.

250
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 So this is what I call, yeah, I did last year, I don't know why this one is yellow,

251
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 but they don't have, so it's more like the hardware problem.

252
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Because I show the same file.

253
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 So this is more like requirement or background.

254
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 And I am referring back to our NTU here.

255
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 And I also have been teaching this course.

256
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 This is year two.

257
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Year two course, signal and system.

258
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I think most of you, if you are in the specialization,

259
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 is information engineering or information technology and so on,

260
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 then you should also take this one.

261
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Here in year two, the signal and system is not even as a core subject.

262
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 So core subject is compulsory.

263
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Every student must take, and you must pass.

264
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 If you're fair, you're, for example, the, this core is a prerequisite for DSP.

265
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 DSP is ES3, Distortion, No Processing, Rhesus, and NTU, NTU Contact.

266
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 And that's why in the admission in the past,

267
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 I'm in charge of the signal processing program, the admission,

268
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 going through those materials.

269
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Normally, if student, you don't take signal and system,

270
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 usually we will reject.

271
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 All right, please, you take something.

272
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Some students don't take signal and system, but take DSP is still okay.

273
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 But DSP here, NTU is elective.

274
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 It's not every student taking this one.

275
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 But signal and system is compulsory.

276
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 But the problem is now, like both CCA,

277
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 I think the communication engineering program,

278
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 usually students come from a very more similar background.

279
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Usually they will be taking signal and system.

280
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 But now since both CCA and SPML, since changing the program contents,

281
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 where they meet about half, for each program,

282
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 about half the students coming from computer background.

283
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 And usually computer engineering or computer science backgrounds

284
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 usually may not even take signal and system or may not take DSP.

285
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 So in a sense, it's a little bit difficult like this for to start this ADSP.

286
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 But then of course, there are also some students can bridge the gap.

287
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 How? Of course, if you don't have at least one of these two courses,

288
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 take them before unfamiliar.

289
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 So I will strongly suggest you,

290
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 because during the first few weeks, usually you don't have even CA or like this,

291
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 like more times.

292
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And unless some students start to finding a job, you know,

293
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 to look for job, they spend time going for the job, so on.

294
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Otherwise, I think you should spend quite some time, you know,

295
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 prepare well for signal and system or DSP.

296
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 The best is you start from signal and system,

297
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 because here you cover, you know, the very basic signals,

298
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 you know, different type of signals and different type of systems

299
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 and very basic property like convolutions, Z-transforms,

300
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 and correlation and so on.

301
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 So those are very basic and we assume you already know

302
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 and then can go faster and stability, you know, transfer functions, all those.

303
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Okay, so these are the so-called requirements for this one.

304
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And then, of course, as I say, in the part one, province part,

305
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 he actually is a part, he's spent about half going through more like the contents in the DSP.

306
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 But even that, because it's not the whole course,

307
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 so it's more like the contents review of DSP.

308
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 So some students find that part, if you don't have the signal and system background,

309
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 you'll find it not so easy.

310
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Okay, so that's why I want to bring this.

311
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 So once you know this, the relation with other courses is quite okay.

312
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 They are more in parallel.

313
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 You go to controlling system, you know, right now,

314
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 there is a linear system course in the 7,000 series,

315
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 or system analysis and so on.

316
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 So related communications like digital communication system,

317
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 you know, some DSP context.

318
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 And then you have some like next semester is a core subject,

319
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 is DSP application, it also related to that,

320
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 but it's less mass but more on some of the hardware and the, yeah,

321
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 or firmware, some of the finite digit effect and so on.

322
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 And then, as I say, particularly for the second half,

323
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 probability and random process is also very important.

324
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 And we had 7,000 series course, 7401.

325
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 So in the past, that 7401 is not on the same day as 6401.

326
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 So I asked, thank us students to take that course at the same time.

327
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 It's easier.

328
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 But now this year, due to the new change,

329
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 the 7401 is also on Monday.

330
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 So you can take one of these.

331
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 So this is the first time that I have taken one of these.

332
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 I cannot take both at least in the same semester.

333
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 So these are more the postgraduate courses.

334
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 So I give you some information so that at least you can see

335
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 the connection and the requirements.

336
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Any questions you would like to ask?

337
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Today the first half is more like a dialogue.

338
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 I give you some basics and also I hope to get some feedback from you also.

339
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 If you have a question, here is.

340
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Although it's big, but we can still do it interactively.

341
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Say yes, please.

342
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Yes, good.

343
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 I wonder if the Part 2 is different from the 7402?

344
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Yes.

345
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Actually, this is a good question.

346
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 I think some of you can also tell.

347
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Particularly those are in the machine learning courses.

348
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 There are some content.

349
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 I won't say maybe less than half, but maybe one third of the two courses

350
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 may be even the same if it happens to be taught by the same lecturer.

351
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Sometimes it can be used, but usually it's less than half.

352
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Also those, you know now there are quite a few machine learning courses.

353
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 There are certain parts.

354
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 There is some overlap.

355
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Surprisingly for this course, also I'm the one teaching this second half

356
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 and statistical signal processing.

357
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 There are almost very little relationship other than using the same approach,

358
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 statistical signal processing.

359
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 I'm more hardworking professor.

360
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 I do things totally quite different.

361
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Not to share the same material, no.

362
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Quite different. Why?

363
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Because for those of you who are going to take the statistical signal processing,

364
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 the one is talking about signal detection parameter estimation.

365
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 It's more on the model than you do that.

366
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 Where here also is a statistical signal processing.

367
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 The one is more like the time series talking about sequence, sequential data.

368
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 For example, you are doing the stock market prediction.

369
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 For example, you will see the time sequence.

370
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 Also, one good example is you apply to speed signal processing

371
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 related to the time sequence.

372
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 We are going linear predictions.

373
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 We are looking at the sequence where the signal detection estimation is taking the data.

374
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 Mostly it's more like batch processing.

375
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 You can apply to extend to more advanced like harmonic filter.

376
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 So that two part, surprisingly if you are seeing there are higher levels,

377
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 you can see they are parallel.

378
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 But statistical signal processing, if you move one step forward,

379
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 including the sequential estimation, sequential detection,

380
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 then it will go to common filter.

381
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Here is the same here.

382
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 You are looking at the linear filter, the optimal filter, the prediction.

383
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 We don't go into common filter, but if you go one level higher, they converge.

384
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Common filter is very powerful and that's why nowadays you still use common filter

385
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 in many practical projects.

386
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 So only at that level, but nowadays we try not to make the courses so difficult

387
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 in the difficult time.

388
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 So we don't go up to that level.

389
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Some students ask me, why don't you teach common filter?

390
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 I say I can teach, but then probably more students may find that part more challenging.

391
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 So I advise those, but I give it a PhD student.

392
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 Once you learn the basics, you can learn one level further.

393
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 So the answer to your question is no.

394
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 They are related, but totally different.

395
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 I will show you, I don't share the material of this course and the other one.

396
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 So good question.

397
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Yes, please.

398
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 So any other?

399
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 Any student who looks from behind, you can come down or I can go to you.

400
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Okay, good.

401
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Anything else you would like to ask?

402
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 No?

403
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 Okay.

404
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 So let me maybe get a quick survey.

405
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 Just raise your hand and so on.

406
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 So if you have taken a signaling system, maybe you'll raise your hand.

407
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 Just raise your hand.

408
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 More than half, probably two thirds.

409
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 How about DSP?

410
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 Okay, very good.

411
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 Quite a lot.

412
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 So how about taking both?

413
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 Because some of you take only one.

414
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Okay, so maybe now.

415
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 So that's very good.

416
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 If you take at least one of them or both, it's better.

417
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 How many of you have never taken these two?

418
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 One of the both?

419
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 How many?

420
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 So I think you can take a look at the other courses.

421
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 And then probably you'll think again or you'll try to spend your time or you'll learn together with other courses.

422
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 Because last year we had one student from computer background and take this course and really fighting quite difficult.

423
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 So maybe the student start only from part two.

424
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 Because last year, we did not come and we wanted to teach.

425
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 And that is a little bit too late because after that there are a lot of assignments and so on for all the courses.

426
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 So anyway, I hope I let you know early.

427
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 So I think that's a good thing.

428
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 Because now the courses have some capacity, some vacancy, then you can really consider.

429
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 But of course I welcome you, everyone, particularly being a call for SPML.

430
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 So I hope you can take a look at the course.

431
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 I hope you can take a look at the course.

432
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 But if you're lacking background, I can only say you should try to prepare yourself well.

433
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 So like magic and so on.

434
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 But I do prepare some appendix to help students.

435
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 I think some students tell me they cannot download the lecture notes.

436
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 Because I put two, one is this so-called one I just showed, the chapter one, upload and you learn.

437
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 As long as even you are in the waiting list, you can log in until you learn you should be able to download.

438
00:42:46,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 And I also upload appendix on linear algebra and like the random Gaussian, not going through all the probability and so on.

439
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 So that's also quite useful because we require some math, but we cannot go through it in detail.

440
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 Okay.

441
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 So, one more question.

442
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 Yeah.

443
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 Let me see what else before we start.

444
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 So let me show you just very briefly.

445
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 This is not me because we have the year two signaling system.

446
00:43:49,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 So this is what I say you see here.

447
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 So this is only part one.

448
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 There is a three part one.

449
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 So here, these are concepts you should be familiar.

450
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 Signal and system, then you have different type of signal and operation of signal which is include very famous convolution correlation.

451
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 And you see here, even so now there are deep learning and so on.

452
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 Remember the very fundamental, the starting point of deep learning is called convolution neural network.

453
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 And the convolution, the concept come from BSP, come from the signal and system.

454
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 Because the basic idea is to do convolution to correlate the signals.

455
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Because neural network is not linear system, but it still contain the linear part.

456
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 It's a combination of linear, the neural function, activation function is no linear.

457
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 So you'll see here.

458
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 And property of system.

459
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 And after that, this is signal, then there you go into the system part, whether the system is time invariant and so on.

460
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 And then also continue time, discrete time, and how you connect these two is by sampling.

461
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 And that's also very important in part one.

462
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 So these are the very basic, you see here convolution operations include that.

463
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 And some properties, you see properties and correlation is also very much related to the nowadays the very fashion.

464
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 You'll see here transformer.

465
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 You'll see transformer is basically the main idea is you just try to do the correlation.

466
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 You focus on the things you like.

467
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 And that's how it's coming from correlation.

468
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 You try to correlate, pay attention to the important part.

469
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 Okay.

470
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 But of course I will not coming through here since most of you have already learned.

471
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 I just tell those students who are lacking the background.

472
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 And this is quite useful.

473
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 This is what I prepare myself using latex.

474
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 Okay, if you're talking about sharing, this part I share with the other courses,

475
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 statistical signal processing because that course also require linear algebraic.

476
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 But this is in the appendix.

477
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 It's not the main content.

478
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 So yeah, it's very important.

479
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 And for this part two, I also include some material,

480
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 like matrix eigenvalues into the power spectrum estimation.

481
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 So that's the, yeah.

482
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 So anyway, this you can download and then take a look at those definition about

483
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 rank and non-space, eigenvector and so on.

484
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 So it requires inverse, singular value decomposition and so on.

485
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 And then some values for equality.

486
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 This is more for the statistical signal processing.

487
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 And then you can even add properties of Gauss-Schwein-Reydarm-Bederberg.

488
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 Which, again, I put into the chapter one.

489
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 So you don't need to worry too much about this correlation.

490
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 So this is another thing I try to, this, let you know some of the useful and related ones.

491
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 Then let me see this.

492
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 This is, today I prepared last year at the end of the revision.

493
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 But maybe you can also at least consider that as some background.

494
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 You see here, so this part two requires linear algebra, calculus, which is derivative and mass derivation.

495
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 Some concept, block diagram, computation and basic probability random process.

496
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 Yeah, those are things you will, I will go back to this again.

497
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 So yeah, I think maybe it's also useful because instead of the end, like you feel a little bit too late to learn.

498
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 Then here you can also see the connection.

499
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 For those already learn DSP, then you see here we also use filter, FIR filter, IRR filter.

500
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 But because we are dealing with a random signal, so we call it more like moving average, MA.

501
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 So filter, we assume you have the concept, or at least how to do it here.

502
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 In my part I don't do the filter design part.

503
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 ProWin's part, he also require you to, I don't know this year whether you will change or not, but in the past you have.

504
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 And the IRR filter, you see, you have IRR filter.

505
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 And these are the all poles, they corresponding to the AR process and IRR filter.

506
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 That one, that one again I will go through in some detail later.

507
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 Okay, so here is also useful.

508
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 Then you see the relationship, the comparison about deterministic signal and random signal.

509
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 Because deterministic signal, you see, we are directly apply Fourier transform into the signal.

510
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 Say for example, you have the side way, when you apply Fourier transform, you will see a spectral line.

511
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 Ideally just one line, but if you have noise, you can spread a little bit, but you always see one very strong line.

512
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 And that's why you use the traditional filter, high pass, low pass, there is no problem.

513
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 You can separate the signal well.

514
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 Okay, so you see here, take DFT, you go through that.

515
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 But for advanced DSP, we are dealing with random signal, at least the part two.

516
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 Then you don't directly apply, because if you apply Fourier transform into the signal directly, you will get into trouble.

517
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 So what you do here is you do some kind of averaging, and that's also a big similar to neural networks.

518
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 You are trying to manipulate, try to reduce the randomness of the signals by going through autocorrelation.

519
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 So here, you apply autocorrelation or cross correlation, then the behaviour of this autocorrelation is more like deterministic signal.

520
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 And after that you apply Fourier transform, you get our spectrum.

521
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 So that's the relationship is also if you start with a white noise or another input random signal, then you see you go through one step.

522
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 So you see the connection.

523
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 But the idea is you are building up on the DSP, ADSP.

524
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 If you don't know how to do this, how can you perform this?

525
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 So you should really learn the basics before you move on to that.

526
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 And also one very interesting relationship is you go through filter for deterministic signal.

527
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 You only need the transfer function, it's very well along this frequency.

528
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 Input goes through this filter, goes through output.

529
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 And then now your input output is random signal.

530
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 Then instead of this, you see you need to take the absolute value and then raise the power of 2.

531
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 Why? Because you go through this correlation.

532
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 So that's the relation with the transfer function, the frequency response.

533
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
 So that's the result.

534
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 But there is some difference.

535
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 And also depending on input, if it's a white noise, then you can simplify this input.

536
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
 The spectrum you have reduced to constant.

537
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 Then you'll get this.

538
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 So that's what we are going to learn in some detail.

539
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:25,000
 Again, I give you some fundamental before.

540
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 Finally, I think I maybe just mention about because some students, they feel they start taking the...

541
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
 Also, you may see, so this is quite interesting.

542
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 I'm always teaching this DSP for the NTU-TUM program.

543
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:04,000
 Where it has this core DSP which is covering all the wave from the signaling system.

544
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 And then to DSP, then finally just a little bit of advanced DSP.

545
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 Because here we devalve this core for students because they are from IC design,

546
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 like electronic technology students here.

547
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 They don't have the signaling system background.

548
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 So this core, I won't go into detail, but just let you know so that you see the relationship.

549
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
 We start from this part one in that course.

550
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,000
 You can see it's a more signal and system content.

551
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 And then you have convolution, different equation, filtering, and Z-transform, transfer function.

552
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 There's a little bit of hardware for DSP, but not covered usually in DSP.

553
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:05,000
 Because for IC design students, they want to use DSP for hardware.

554
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 And then you can see the book is this one.

555
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
 And this is only part one, it's about half of the course.

556
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 And then you can see what I teach for many years in this.

557
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 So you see here, this is part two.

558
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
 And I give you a paper here.

559
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 You see, we start with digital signal spectrum.

560
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
 That's about deterministic signals.

561
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
 And then DFT, and then FFT is a fast transfer.

562
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 And after that, moving to DSP.

563
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 Of course, this digital spectrum is also belong to DSP.

564
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
 But it's dealing with deterministic signal.

565
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:58,000
 And after that is design of digital filter, linear phase FIR filter.

566
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 And the last two chapters, looks like we're getting from this advanced DSP.

567
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:14,000
 But normally we don't require those IC design students to learn this.

568
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 Just give them an introduction to go through quickly.

569
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 So that's how we teach the other MSE course where it's covering the whole spectrum from

570
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:37,000
 signaling system DSP, all the way to finally a little bit of introduction of advanced DSP.

571
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:49,000
 So I guess that's all my introduction before we go through that.

572
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
 So let me come back here again because some students came late.

573
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
 This is important. I want to highlight this.

574
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,000
 So pay attention to the...

575
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:12,000
 We start from the teaching sequence again.

576
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,000
 So today I only teach way one here, but not really too much technical detail

577
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
 because I will come back only after the recess.

578
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
 So after that, it will be full.

579
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:35,000
 He will cover six weeks and get one assignment.

580
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,000
 So today I'm more like give you general instruction.

581
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
 After that we take a break.

582
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,000
 Then I will start to teach part of the lecture one because some students may not come today

583
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
 because this week is supposed to be a chop.

584
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
 They may move from other courses to work here and they will miss the introduction.

585
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 And then this is more important, the final exam and continued assessment.

586
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,000
 So the final exam paper now is we set four questions.

587
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 If you look at the past exam paper later in the library two years back,

588
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
 at that time we still had five questions.

589
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,000
 Five questions, we will have three questions for part one, two questions for part two.

590
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 But I think from last year or even the year before it changed to just four questions.

591
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 And here is a simple, so in this thing is somehow easier,

592
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
 but you need to know the percentage is also higher.

593
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
 And that's why last year one student for some reason, quite a few students,

594
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:57,000
 maybe a few students did not attend the quiz, then it will be quite challenging

595
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
 because 20% go and not a good reason.

596
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 If you're already on that day on MC, then probably we will consider make up

597
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 or maybe consider that component as not counting into the percentage.

598
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,000
 So anyway, just pay attention and plan your time well.

599
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:34,000
 For year one student usually you should stay here at least for the first year.

600
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,000
 Yeah, for considering even if you are looking for job,

601
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,000
 now you can do online or really need to view nowadays.

602
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:52,000
 You see here the no visa requirement, at least then you can,

603
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:00,000
 the air ticket is not so expensive, so you can consider that option really necessary.

604
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
 Try not to miss like this the quiz.

605
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
 So I think it's probably we take a break,

606
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:17,000
 and then we can come back or start the chapter one,

607
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 go through mostly some of the concepts and also the

608
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:37,000
 probabilities and random process, little bit to introduce into this part too.

609
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,000
 Any questions to raise?

610
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
 Just like earlier one very good question.

611
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
 Any other?

612
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
 Yeah, sorry?

613
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:03,000
 Yeah, one bring back home assignment, yes,

614
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
 because most are considered as CA, you know here,

615
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
 we call CA continuous assessment, which is not exam.

616
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
 So we have two component, so one assignment which is set by problem.

617
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
 In my part I just take one quiz which is physical one,

618
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
 I did that for the past two or three years.

619
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:33,000
 Yes?

620
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,000
 The one I think probably you will know next week.

621
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
 Normally in the past he will say probably five or six,

622
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
 then after that usually it's two weeks, then usually it's after recess week,

623
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
 because it's more like some mini project they will need to spend some time,

624
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
 maybe after recess week or yeah, all that time.

625
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 If we have two, normally that way I, for my other course,

626
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
 for some of you you may obtain the statistical signal processing on Wednesday.

627
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
 Also follow the same pattern, one assignment,

628
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,000
 and the other is a quiz, yes.

629
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
 Yeah, good question. Any other question you would like to raise?

630
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
 Any from other students?

631
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 Because next week I will not be here,

632
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
 if you want to ask question you can email me or you can convey to ProWoo.

633
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
 I think for the job,

634
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
 not here the end of next week, I think in the middle, Wednesday or Thursday,

635
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
 I don't remember.

636
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
 Now our class is on Monday, so you still can consider

637
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
 by next week.

638
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
 The registration system looks like quite stable,

639
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
 because some students drop from one course, attend the other,

640
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
 some courses have some vacancy, but some popular courses

641
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
 already quite full, so you need to consider that also.

642
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
 Particularly if you are dropping out from the SE,

643
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
 if there is vacancy you can come back.

644
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
 If you are SE, the capacity already full,

645
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
 you cannot be even in the waiting list. Waiting list is for those students

646
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
 not taking that as SE. If you are from other programs,

647
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 this one you are from SPML,

648
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,000
 if there is vacancy you are joining right now, then it becomes directly confirmed.

649
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
 But in case it is already filled up like

650
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,000
 6407, Group A, you can check yourself.

651
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,000
 It is already full, then assume you are already in Group A,

652
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
 then you drop out, someone else fill up. Then later you cannot go

653
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
 into that group anymore, not even in the waiting list. That's why some students complain,

654
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,000
 but that's the system, because normally we will locate

655
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
 the students by the program into the

656
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
 confirmed list first, but you don't randomly drop out if it is already

657
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
 full. And similarly in Group B, like some students in Group B

658
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
 you are in the confirmed list, but now there is a gap, it's okay, you can

659
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,000
 join directly, but you cannot move on to Group A

660
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
 because it's already maximum, there is no

661
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
 space, even not in the waiting list. So you have to be careful

662
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
 about this regulation. If you are in the other program,

663
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
 you are not guaranteed to be confirmed later,

664
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
 unless there is like currently those in Group B,

665
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,000
 like the 6407, Group B,

666
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
 those are in waiting list, you know your queue number, then you can roughly estimate.

667
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,000
 Most of them can be going, but those are at the end, then

668
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
 you may not get a place, so you have to be very careful.

669
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
 I try to help you based on what I know.

670
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
 Any

671
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
 questions? If not, then we take a break, we come back

672
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
 about 7.50. We have a clock at the back, you can

673
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
 refer to that.

674
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
 7.52.

675
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
 See you later. If you have questions, you can also

676
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
 ask me during the break or at the end of the class.

677
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
 Thank you.
