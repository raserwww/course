1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:29,280
 .

2
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:14,400
 Okay, so let's start the class.

3
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:26,600
 Since I think this is the last lecture and also the last week of the teaching week.

4
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:34,600
 For this course, our exam is almost the beginning.

5
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:42,440
 The first day is Friday, the study week, next week Friday, but our course will be Saturday,

6
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,940
 Saturday afternoon.

7
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:52,760
 So I hope for most of you, it should be your first exam paper.

8
00:03:52,760 --> 00:04:05,480
 And then also because most of you are new students from the August patch.

9
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:23,940
 So perhaps I may briefly mention also some exams, things you need to take note, which

10
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:31,920
 particularly during your first exam such as forgetting to bring the matriculation card

11
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:40,480
 and forgetting to bring some of the calculated one.

12
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:50,680
 So these are things you need to take note other than preparing for the exams.

13
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,440
 So let's see what I have today.

14
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:15,720
 I will finish the last small part of chapter 3, which is the eigen space, eigen decommission

15
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,280
 method applying to spectrum estimation.

16
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:36,080
 I know this is a difficult part, so I will try to narrow down some scope after finishing

17
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,840
 this lecture.

18
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,719
 But it's quite useful, the techniques you learn.

19
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:54,640
 So anyway, every year the scope of the exam may vary somewhat.

20
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:02,080
 Also some of the fundamental ones, they always require you to burn and memorize whether it

21
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,320
 could eventually appear in the exam paper or not because you cannot say, oh, this is

22
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,200
 very basic and very fundamental.

23
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,080
 Even not in the exam paper, you should learn it well.

24
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:29,360
 So don't realize too much on past year exam paper.

25
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:37,360
 You can refer that as a reference, but the important one is to understand the basics,

26
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,480
 techniques, basic knowledge and how to apply and so on.

27
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:55,280
 So later in conjunction with the quiz, the one we just took last week, I will also briefly

28
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,320
 discuss some of that.

29
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:11,040
 So anyway, regarding this chapter 3, I will not go through the early part, but more on

30
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,280
 this icon analysis method.

31
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:24,920
 So here the starting point is you need to have some linear algebraic magic knowledge

32
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:35,360
 of words, such as how to get icon value, how to get the icon vector, and so on.

33
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:47,280
 So I think the determinant solved the polynomial equation and being able to handle some solving

34
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:57,160
 a system of equation which I always fear is quite fundamental as an engineering student,

35
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:04,360
 including those perhaps considered in the computer science or computer technology area.

36
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:14,080
 Still less, you are more in coding, but still I fear quite useful like this, particularly

37
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:25,760
 those aiming to do research in certain states in the future.

38
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:41,000
 So that part I will not go into detail because you should try your best to learn from how

39
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 to do that.

40
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,120
 And also, you know, whether the two vectors are also going to know or the subspace also

41
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
 going to know, we start with two vector also going to know.

42
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:06,240
 And I can think about you do the inner product and then the inner product in that way is

43
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
 no projection.

44
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,400
 If in the 2D plane, you think about 90 degrees.

45
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,240
 So these two vectors are also going to know.

46
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,640
 So that's one way.

47
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:27,480
 And then we also introduce orthogonal matrix, Hermitian matrix.

48
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,400
 So these are in both complexes.

49
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,920
 I later will talk a little bit, then you need to have a good understanding of complex number,

50
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,640
 conjugate, and so on.

51
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,680
 And then similar to eigenvalue, there is another very important one.

52
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:59,640
 Not just for this course, but for you, say, you are applying to other related topic.

53
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,880
 I believe most of you are taking the 6407, the machine learning one.

54
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:15,160
 I know some of the content there, singular value, the eigenvalue, the commodation subspace.

55
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,560
 I think it should be also important there.

56
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,560
 Even that's the signal learning.

57
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
 Okay.

58
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,280
 So yeah.

59
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,959
 And then the very important one is why we need all these orthogonal and subspace.

60
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:39,319
 Because when you apply to, you know, our course here, as I emphasize many times, basically,

61
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:42,000
 considering signal and noise.

62
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:51,760
 And then it could be random, could be deterministic, but for noise, we always assume random.

63
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:59,440
 And in this eigen-decommodation, eigenanalysis method using eigen-decommodation.

64
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:17,000
 So it's very important to see our setting here is after working on this auto-correlation

65
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,640
 magic from the major signal, then we can decompose.

66
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,600
 Of course, with some assumption.

67
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,240
 For example, the noise, there will be following the white noise distribution.

68
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,120
 The signal will be harmonics, in this case, a sideways-related harmonic.

69
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,160
 But it could be random signal also.

70
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:48,320
 For example, the phase, it could be like following a uniform distribution.

71
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:58,480
 And so therefore, the one important result here is you can decompose from a major data,

72
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,640
 which is X into, you know, the major data is signal and noise.

73
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:14,920
 So you can decompose into two subspace, just based on the singular value decomposition.

74
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:26,640
 So therefore, from here, you can see you get the larger eigenvalue.

75
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:38,719
 And for square matrix, and then for the positive semi-definite matrix, and the matrix being

76
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:41,199
 square like in our case here, X.

77
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,760
 So the singular value and eigenvalue, they are more or less the same, because they are

78
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,160
 all positive.

79
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,920
 And except for singular value, we can raise to square.

80
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,880
 For eigenvalue, you just keep it as you calculate.

81
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,240
 So therefore, you can see here, if you're learning this eigenvalue from high to low,

82
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,280
 so those small least, they're all equal because there's a lot of noise.

83
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,960
 They will be in the noise subspace and those larger ones in the signal subspace.

84
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:27,120
 And the important one is, we already know also, you know, so in terms of subspace, you

85
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:35,840
 can also consider there are also, you know, because I mean every, because a space is explained

86
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,360
 by several vectors.

87
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,400
 So each vector in this subspace must be also going to pose a vector, generate the other

88
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
 subspace.

89
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,120
 Where two subspace, one is signal.

90
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,560
 And then the other is noise.

91
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,200
 So this is a very important property.

92
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:04,400
 And yeah, so based on that, we follow the discussion about a shield signal, you see here, cosine

93
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,520
 and then, but it's not totally like the deterministic cosine.

94
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,680
 So if the phase could be uniformly distributed.

95
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:25,079
 So we get the model and then again do the decomposition and then analyze and see the,

96
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,439
 yeah, get this.

97
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:36,280
 So here we also follow the important result about the signal space and noise subspace.

98
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:46,959
 And then based on that, I think we will quickly go through some of the methods which are very

99
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,000
 popular and useful here.

100
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,959
 Let me see.

101
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:08,840
 So the first one is, I think some researchers in doing this, piece of raincoat harmonic

102
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
 decomposition.

103
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,000
 I think in show is PhD.

104
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,640
 So it's very nice name.

105
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,760
 Those are doing PhD here.

106
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:29,600
 So therefore here is what we're doing here is we look at one of them, UN, yeah, only

107
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,640
 one is normalized.

108
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,160
 I can make the corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue.

109
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:43,600
 And as we just mentioned, it will corresponding to the noise of Rx.

110
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,680
 Rx is the major data you have.

111
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:53,800
 They will form the auto correlation matrix from here and then divide this.

112
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:04,400
 So this is, yeah, this is the vector to the, it's a column, a transport.

113
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,040
 And then following the uncertainty, we have this.

114
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:24,439
 So therefore this vector, it will be, yeah, it will be doing an inner product.

115
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:41,640
 So it only when F equal to Fk, which is the, you know, for those corresponding to the signal,

116
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,600
 then it will be equal to zero.

117
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,440
 But otherwise it will not be equal to zero.

118
00:16:50,440 --> 00:17:02,840
 So therefore in this case, you can see this one, you can expand it into this, which is

119
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,840
 a polynomial.

120
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:16,680
 And then for the polynomial, we have always you can convert along the unit circle.

121
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,960
 I will later talk about this.

122
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,600
 This is very useful.

123
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:30,640
 You can think about one is evaluate along the unit circle, while the other is a Pj,

124
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,560
 a polynomial over the whole complex plane.

125
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:46,240
 So therefore if this is all equal to N, then we all know we can always have the NP, zeroes,

126
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,680
 which located along the unit circle.

127
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:05,240
 So that, yeah, so therefore once we have this vector available, the frequency, it can be

128
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,360
 obtained from all these loads.

129
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,959
 So ideally it will be located along the unit circle.

130
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:24,159
 But in practice, you may not exactly get at that location due to some small perturbation

131
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:26,719
 and noise and so on.

132
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:34,560
 So therefore the idea here is even if we, if it is zero because you take the inverse,

133
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,159
 it will be infinity large.

134
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:43,159
 But in general, you will expect this value very small.

135
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,159
 So you want to divide a very small number.

136
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,159
 You will see as a function of f.

137
00:18:51,159 --> 00:19:01,560
 Of course it's only on those selected frequency which corresponding to the signal because

138
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:08,560
 we have the source signal having those specific frequency.

139
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:17,560
 So therefore this is one of the quite early methods, 1973, which is many years ago.

140
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:30,960
 And then the idea is very useful but in practice it is not a sadmiot because it's very sensitive

141
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
 to noise.

142
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:39,360
 So that's one of the methods to start with.

143
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,360
 And then you can also see the example here.

144
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:56,160
 We have given the autocorrelation value, which you did just for the quiz, the related one.

145
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:03,560
 So assume this is for process, it contains a single sine wave in white noise.

146
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,560
 This is our assumption here.

147
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:13,760
 And then we have to determine the frequency of the sinusoid and the value of the additive

148
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,160
 noise.

149
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:24,560
 So what you do here is since these are given, so we form the autocorrelation matrix in this

150
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,060
 case, we're given this.

151
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,060
 So it's easy.

152
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:34,300
 And then now we solve the eigenvalue problem.

153
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:41,060
 So given a matrix, square matrix, you should be able to follow based on this definition,

154
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,060
 polynomial, explaining, so lay equal to zero.

155
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:51,659
 And in this case, you can get three eigenvalues here.

156
00:20:51,660 --> 00:21:01,060
 And then you rank it according to the, to the, they're all positive, but you rank according

157
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,060
 to the largest value.

158
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,980
 Actually this one is the largest, this is second.

159
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,540
 This is the smallest one.

160
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:14,660
 So yeah, so therefore the one corresponding to the noise will be here.

161
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,860
 This eigenvalue also give the noise value.

162
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:29,540
 And then to get the eigenvector, we already know you're applying this eigenvalue.

163
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:38,699
 And this matrix will become singular and then you solve this and then normalize the vector.

164
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:41,860
 So therefore you will get this.

165
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:48,260
 And so in this case, this is second order polynomial.

166
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,860
 And you can get, you can get the two rules here.

167
00:21:51,860 --> 00:22:04,020
 And it happened to be a pair of the complex value along the unicycle.

168
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:10,340
 So based on the relationship, this one should be always expressed 2 pi f1.

169
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,060
 So f1 here to be 1 over 8.

170
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,820
 And this is the digital frequency.

171
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,820
 It's defined from 0 to half.

172
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,540
 So we get this frequency here.

173
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,699
 And then you can extend to a more practical method.

174
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:36,060
 This music, music is not our playing music, it's multiple signal classification algorithm.

175
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,740
 Just take the first few, later become music.

176
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,379
 This is also very well known.

177
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:49,340
 It's developing from the PSD method.

178
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,220
 And it happened to be this is part of the PSD thesis.

179
00:22:53,220 --> 00:23:02,100
 And yeah, this method is very well known in the Ray signal processing in the filter area.

180
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:11,699
 Because doing signal processing more or less at least know what this means.

181
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:20,500
 So therefore the one here is we, you know, the approach is similar.

182
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:30,380
 You're visiting this, but now you're right as not just one vector.

183
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:39,500
 You have several vectors, which is if you look at our definition, this is corresponding

184
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:48,020
 to the noise subspace, you see, all the signal after NP, NP plus 1 after NP will be 1 here.

185
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:59,580
 So again, ideally, you see, given to this also, the ability, if you evaluate at that

186
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:11,020
 signal frequency in total, 1 after NP, this 1 over this 0 at the total source frequency,

187
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,860
 it should be equal to infinity large.

188
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:23,379
 So therefore, again, the way to do is to know when you get the spectrum, you don't

189
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:27,340
 know the exact, because we only measure the signal.

190
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,219
 And then from both, based on the measure data, we try to identify.

191
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:40,419
 So therefore, in this case, your project is a continued function of F from say 0 to 1

192
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:43,780
 over 2, but thankfully.

193
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:52,620
 And after that, you will see some peak value, which is, could be very large, but may not

194
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,379
 reach infinity, because we can't measure infinity large.

195
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:59,980
 And yeah, based on this.

196
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:11,180
 So again, this measure, as I mentioned, initially is part of the PhD work, which improved the

197
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,820
 PhD measure here.

198
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:22,740
 Again you can look at the autocorrelation matrix, but now this time, we make it more

199
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,740
 complicated, it's complex.

200
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,500
 And so you see here.

201
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,020
 So this is what I say Hermitian matrix.

202
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:37,180
 If it's real, it will be symmetry, but this is not this conjugate, you see here.

203
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:44,220
 So compact 2J, then conjugate, it will be just change the sign, similarly here.

204
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,300
 But for real, it will be equal.

205
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,540
 The real part must be equal.

206
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:57,500
 And then again, step one is solve the rules of this polynomial.

207
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:03,220
 Then from here, in this case, we get the three eigenvalues, and one is a larger one.

208
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,700
 The other two corresponding to noise, they are the same here.

209
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,260
 So this one is a bit more complicated.

210
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,580
 There's a single complex exponential.

211
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,860
 This one corresponding to the signal.

212
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:25,300
 And the other corresponding to noise subspace.

213
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:32,100
 So I will say this is a little bit more challenging question.

214
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:43,980
 And last year, one of the exam paper question, modified from this kind of example.

215
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,820
 But it turns out to be, there are always a few students, very good.

216
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:56,939
 They can solve and even get the perfect solution.

217
00:26:56,939 --> 00:27:00,020
 I worked with you doing the quiz about there.

218
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:07,939
 I should say many students found this kind of question not so easy.

219
00:27:07,939 --> 00:27:16,060
 So anyway, how to solve that is, you see, you follow the similar step.

220
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:26,580
 This one is more complicated because for the noise, you have one eigenvalue, you need

221
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:32,100
 to solve two eigenvectors.

222
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,620
 So you need to fix.

223
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,500
 It can always be easy to solve one.

224
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:42,379
 But once you fix this one, you have to find a way to solve the other one and also make

225
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:44,580
 these two orthogonal.

226
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,820
 So it's quite challenging, I will say.

227
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:59,699
 So anyway, this year I will make the question easier, not to include this part.

228
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:04,899
 So I will later talk about that.

229
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:08,820
 So once you get this vector, you're plugging.

230
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:16,860
 And then again, even this part, you will take quite some effort to simplify into this equation

231
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,500
 with respect to, you see, the sine cosine.

232
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:28,179
 And then after that, you'll need to, that was right last year's exam paper, give a so-called

233
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,820
 hint to the trigonometric identity.

234
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:44,020
 Then you can plug in and then translate into a polynomial equation, then solve it and find

235
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,860
 the f in this case equal to 1 over 4.

236
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,380
 But once you file, it's easy to plug in to solve.

237
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:59,580
 But if you do not know this, it may take some effort to even calculate that.

238
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
 OK?

239
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:10,700
 So in this case, again, I won't go into the detail because it takes a lot of effort to

240
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,540
 work out.

241
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,900
 And then I can value the smaller 1 equal to 1.

242
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,620
 So the value in this case is equal to 1.

243
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,300
 That's what we already know.

244
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:29,980
 And then, need to make good use of this Euler's formula.

245
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:39,220
 This is a very famous Euler's formula, which for signaling system, we always emphasize

246
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:45,980
 students should get this, know how this comes from and how to apply, how to change from

247
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,700
 complex exponential to relating the sine cosine.

248
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,500
 Of course, your real part, imaginary part.

249
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
 OK?

250
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:05,580
 So, yeah, later I will also talk about some notation because in the book, sometimes some

251
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,460
 notation are not quite consistent.

252
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:18,740
 So you should base on the given problem and should be able to easily identify where is

253
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:25,860
 the input signal and the measure data.

254
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,140
 So it can be y-ang or the x-ang and plus w-ang.

255
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:37,460
 But sometimes we make the x of n as a measure data and the signal is s of n and so on.

256
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,060
 And noise usually we use w, sometimes we use d.

257
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:53,060
 And also auto correlation matrix, we can denote this instead of you know r of x.

258
00:30:53,060 --> 00:31:02,940
 And then another method is eigenvector method, which are quite similar.

259
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,820
 First you can see introducing, there we go, waiting here.

260
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:14,740
 And then there is another quite famous minimum norm method, which somewhat related to signal

261
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:21,820
 estimation, the parameter estimation in the statistical signal processing.

262
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:29,860
 And so they are all similar in the same year as you can see, all try to minimize the denominator

263
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,460
 and five peaks.

264
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,700
 So I think I will not go into detail.

265
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:44,380
 And then you can see, you can consider doing some simulation and then see the noisy data.

266
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,060
 We get, yeah, this is the first PSD method.

267
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:53,580
 You can see the estimation is not very, it's very sensitive.

268
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,740
 Music is better, the other method, they all looks better.

269
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:08,740
 So okay, I think that's end the lectures here.

270
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:28,420
 And any questions you would like to ask before we, yeah, so my plan is I will next try to

271
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:40,100
 go through some statistics about the Simon Wang, because problem is already finished,

272
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,380
 it's back, so he won't be here.

273
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:52,820
 And he also say he will not upload the solution to the end student, because like last year

274
00:32:52,820 --> 00:33:02,939
 they upload, but then some students this year just copy from those, which are different

275
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:08,060
 from the new question, maybe similar, but different.

276
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:17,179
 During the quiz here, also I see some students very few, even copy from last year's quiz

277
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,900
 question, which are totally related, but not the same.

278
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:33,900
 So I always emphasize you can learn from past year paper, past year, but try to understand.

279
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,660
 Usually we will, not yours exactly the same.

280
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:45,260
 So anyway, it may be related, but sometimes the change may be quite subtle also.

281
00:33:45,260 --> 00:34:03,260
 So yeah, and then I, depending on how much time I take, based on my experience, I may

282
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:10,060
 spend say maybe just less than one hour.

283
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:23,060
 And I won't take a break in the middle or try my best to give you some reviews and tips.

284
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,940
 First goes through my part, since this is part of my lecture.

285
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:35,460
 So I will talk a little bit on the quiz and how the students performed and compared to

286
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,540
 last year and so on.

287
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,699
 So this is first.

288
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:45,219
 And after that, as you all, I don't know other lecturers, some, I heard some lecturers

289
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:52,980
 they don't give the scope just to review everything, but my style usually will narrow

290
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:59,420
 down some scope, particularly courses like this one and 7402.

291
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,420
 Too much.

292
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:09,940
 So I see which one you need to review during the coming weeks.

293
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:15,060
 There are less than two weeks because our paper is the first one, I believe.

294
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:23,300
 Most of you may be some pick the Friday, some paper on Friday.

295
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:32,380
 And then after that, I will give some time for consultations either perhaps some of you

296
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,420
 will have common questions to share with others.

297
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:49,540
 We will try to answer or if not, then maybe I will stay back for individuals, for those

298
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:55,220
 who have questions to discuss and so on.

299
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:08,100
 So that's my plan for the evening, this being the last lectures.

300
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:17,500
 So we will be more flexible.

301
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:30,220
 Does anyone have any questions from you or anyone have some questions to ask for the

302
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,220
 quiz?

303
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:41,860
 Last year, it took me quite some effort to mark because I happen to have the two courses.

304
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:49,940
 The two quizzes are very close to each other and they all have a lot more students this

305
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,940
 year.

306
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:58,500
 So anyway, I managed to finish this one.

307
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,660
 It looks like home.

308
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,379
 So let me just...

309
00:37:06,379 --> 00:37:13,940
 You know this year we are doing at least...

310
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:28,580
 I don't know whether for both the CA1, which is the assignment by Pro Wen, I think the thing

311
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:38,580
 we call CA1, CA2, CA2 is the quiz.

312
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,100
 I only talked average mark first.

313
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,700
 So this is 2024.

314
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:55,380
 And this year, I think CA1 usually assignment is slightly higher, about 75 average mark.

315
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,380
 And then for the quiz, it's about 73.

316
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:06,700
 Actually, it should be higher because we have a few students that did not apply leave and

317
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
 did not come.

318
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:16,660
 So they cannot get the make-up, so become zero for these components.

319
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,660
 And so this is...

320
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,620
 This year, the average.

321
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:34,259
 Last year, CA1 only 73.4 and the quiz is even lower, 68.7.

322
00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:42,580
 So you'll see here we have improvement about four plus marks where the CA1 is still also

323
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:48,339
 better but the difference not that big.

324
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:55,700
 So I hope this year the students learn these calls like this.

325
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:05,940
 I hope they get better understanding, better quality on the students' side.

326
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:14,140
 And we do hope they will do better in the final exams also.

327
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,259
 So this is the comparing to last year.

328
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:25,859
 And then comparing to these two, CA1, if you look at the distribution, you'll see because

329
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:31,940
 we are looking like at ring-damp signal.

330
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:37,220
 So if you see, the average is here, 75 this year.

331
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:48,700
 So quite a good Gaussian distribution in the sense of about...

332
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:59,980
 The majority is near the center and then there are fewer to both sides.

333
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:06,180
 But on the other hand, for CA2, it's not that case.

334
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:15,540
 So even so, the average is a bit lower.

335
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:33,379
 Then there are quite a large number of students at higher grades.

336
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:42,500
 You see, I think I don't get the exact number but quite a lot of you even get A plus grade

337
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:49,740
 which is 85 and above much more than the CA1.

338
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:55,860
 And then also if you're counting A and A minor, A minor is 75.

339
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:04,420
 So probably about two-thirds of the students achieve A minor and above.

340
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,900
 But then because the problem is...

341
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,100
 So that's what we call like long tail.

342
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:22,260
 There are a number of students, not that many but there are quite some students much lower

343
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,260
 than this.

344
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,500
 I say a few students not even coming for the quiz.

345
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:37,500
 And where the assignment every student somebody and the lowest grade for CA1 also higher than

346
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,500
 this CA2.

347
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:46,660
 Other than the few students who did not come, there are also quite a small number of students

348
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:57,779
 which get relatively low because they maybe did not understand the question well or some

349
00:41:57,779 --> 00:42:05,660
 of them did not remember what the formula or the basic or did wrongly.

350
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,859
 So there are various reasons I try to find out.

351
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:22,860
 So anyway I think overall as I said the majority of the students did a good understanding and

352
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:29,580
 did a good work for the quiz for the last week.

353
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,940
 So we already released the result in grades.

354
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:44,420
 So I think you can see what you have done.

355
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:48,020
 I hope you remember what you have done because we have too many papers.

356
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:55,940
 We are not written you the quiz paper.

357
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:07,500
 So that's overall picture and any questions?

358
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:22,900
 If you strongly fear you will not get good grades which we try to be fair actually later

359
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:30,660
 you will see at least on my side I did mark quite easy going.

360
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,100
 I usually give partial mark even the results are not correct.

361
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,740
 And the same for the final exam paper.

362
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,940
 So I think I want to also highlight here is even during the final exam you some question

363
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,260
 you may not remember correctly.

364
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:51,020
 So try your best to write down something unless it's totally wrong.

365
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:57,660
 It's relevant as I say if you copy from last year's question which are not relevant but

366
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:06,580
 like this you will try your best and you know write partially correct or related you will

367
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,860
 get some partial mark.

368
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:18,700
 Don't leave the answer just totally blank like some students did for the quiz.

369
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:29,860
 So that's about most of you new students for this and you are taking this paper is likely

370
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,780
 the first paper.

371
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:40,700
 And then also we still keep the three hours and then I will say the three hours is long

372
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:48,180
 enough most of the student finish in probably two hours but you can just spend your time

373
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,180
 doing checking.

374
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:53,780
 Don't worry about not enough time because we are considering cutting down to two and

375
00:44:53,780 --> 00:45:00,500
 half hours probably maybe next year or so but not finalize.

376
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:18,100
 So that's some something so that's the overall one and then you know in media question I

377
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:28,100
 would like to let me start with showing the quiz paper first.

378
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,660
 So this is the one you are taking.

379
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:45,220
 So first even after the quiz anyone find some typo errors in this question one sub question

380
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:55,020
 A. Actually I apologize for making this typo error here.

381
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:01,620
 So that's my fault but that will not happen in the exam paper we have quite a few other

382
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,940
 colleagues to check.

383
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:14,020
 So this one should be M also in the case of two it will be two but for example in this

384
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:18,620
 case we have M equal to four and one of the solutions.

385
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:37,140
 So the power should be M but then the whole class only two students correct correctility

386
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:45,940
 using M equal to like four then it will change the end so the correct formula should be up

387
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:56,340
 to M but anyway let me just go through that because initially I thought I will give you

388
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:05,860
 the hint and most of I mean all of you should be able to follow it just a change of variable

389
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:14,820
 you see we have we can do change of variable in normal variable but in random variable

390
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:24,300
 is the same you see here so here I try to make a guess of time to explain about random

391
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:32,980
 variable also if X is a random variable then X square also a random variable also this

392
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:40,020
 random variable it will be you know whatever random value X can be positive negative this

393
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,700
 sum is always at least greater or equal to equal to zero.

394
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:53,620
 So therefore if you new this is a new random variable we call it Y okay alright okay so

395
00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:05,100
 so see here the given formula here you know the result what I ask is a value of X square

396
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:14,259
 I think so therefore it's easier you look at this call it Y first okay make a call it

397
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:21,580
 Y okay so and then then you can find this formula actually the beginning of thinking

398
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:27,860
 about whether I should give this a hint but then I thought it would be easier to give so

399
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:37,140
 if you're putting this formula value of Y will be equal to E of Y square yeah right

400
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:43,980
 Y is because you call it X or call it Y it doesn't matter what the formula here the relationship

401
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:56,940
 is always work for any of the so-called random variable so therefore you you need to evaluate

402
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:05,980
 that and then after that you'll need to now we use this relationship you see E of you

403
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:14,060
 know Y Y is equal to X power 2 even for random variable Y power 2 will be X power 2 then

404
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:26,460
 raise power 2 okay right and then now you'll need to subtract E of X power 2 then raise

405
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:34,299
 power 2 and for random variable they also follow the normal operation X power 2 then

406
00:49:34,299 --> 00:49:42,620
 raise power 2 you become X power 4 okay and then what you will be doing here this one

407
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:51,060
 is the same your your evaluate X power 2 and because zero mean this is the this one will

408
00:49:51,060 --> 00:50:03,859
 be the value of value of X alright so that's how it's power 2 then now if you go back to

409
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:10,860
 the to the to the moment there because we are dealing with zero mean so therefore the

410
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:19,860
 the value should be equal to E force moment because it's zero mean so so you have that

411
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:30,220
 and then subtract E here we already the formula give you all the moment 2 and 4 and and so

412
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:38,779
 on raise power 2 so so they want the if I hope some students also not really sure the

413
00:50:38,779 --> 00:50:45,259
 meaning this one being one multiplied by 3 5 all the way up to depending on the value

414
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:56,260
 M you see so in our case here and is equal to 4 equal to 4 and you will be E of X of

415
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:07,780
 4 so the so by the way it should be the correct one if I say raise sigma power n it will be

416
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:16,620
 one multiplied by 3 because 2 multiplied by you see up to yeah one three and the final

417
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:22,860
 one is n minus one 4 minus 1 equal to 3 so you so you stop here and then it should be sigma

418
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:31,220
 power 4 then you subtract this one is X squared just like the valiant and we go to 2 then they

419
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:39,740
 will be no problem is sigma power 2 good power 2 so everyone know this part so so therefore

420
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:46,020
 you will be 3 sigma power 4 minus sigma power 4 because it raise power 2 raise the power 2 is

421
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:55,899
 equal to so the if I did not make a make a mistake it will be correct one will be 2 sigma

422
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:05,500
 power 4 but of course the maturity of of student took my stay as the correct thing so the so

423
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:18,180
 the result is 3 sigma power 2 minus if you remember I think most of you did that so anyway it's a

424
00:52:18,779 --> 00:52:26,020
 way to compensate I also every student as long you took this one you got you got full mark for this

425
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:35,259
 first first subject even if you some student even do not so by right this if you my mistake you

426
00:52:35,259 --> 00:52:44,020
 took my mistake you will get this answer but if you big a few student big wrongly I will I keep all

427
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:51,660
 the students like because you see it's a sub question 20 mark so you'll get this okay so you

428
00:52:51,660 --> 00:53:02,060
 don't it's my fault I shouldn't make this kind of typo typo errors here okay so this is the

429
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:11,540
 the at the first one so what you do here is just the thing about random variable in the same way as

430
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:20,580
 you are dealing with you know better at least in applying this formula here because a random

431
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:32,660
 variable you raise power 2 still random variable okay so I hope yeah so so this is in paper because

432
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:40,860
 my my mistake this should be the majority of student get this and we'll consider consider

433
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:51,020
 correct and even yeah so that's the first sub question so to hope the question the lesson to

434
00:53:51,020 --> 00:54:00,420
 learn here is how you know on my side will be more careful actually this is probably the first

435
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:11,260
 mistake type of error I even I did even for even for quiz paper like that so anyway that's

436
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:20,860
 should be settled but you are not penalized because it's my my mistake so this is first

437
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:33,620
 the second the sub question be which is supposed to be also very easy one because means I think most

438
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:42,500
 of the student can get the main correct but when it comes to variant I see many different answer

439
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:49,980
 because this is this one no mistake on my side so if you do not do not get right you will get

440
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:58,980
 some some of the top but even if you try to derive the barrier even down so long it over

441
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:09,540
 since you are doing something following the at least the evaluator barrier of of of each of them

442
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:21,779
 yeah then you will get some partial mark so so in in this case it one good lesson to learn is I

443
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:28,500
 already emphasized many times variant of a random variable unless they're not random variable a

444
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:36,540
 very random variable is always positive and cannot be zero so this is a very basic guideline so but

445
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:45,420
 I still see some students get the negative value or some say the variant of jet equal to equal to

446
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:55,060
 zero or negative so even if you do not get the correct correct answer you should check using the

447
00:55:55,060 --> 00:56:03,460
 very common sense and knowledge so I think the main is very easy because it will be it will be it

448
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:14,020
 will be linear so means of jet will be equal to means of 2x minor is it mean is a mean is a linear

449
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:24,980
 operation so you whatever you see negative you will also use this negative side here and then of

450
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:34,860
 course a mean is a linear then you can put it out to multiply by mean of x sub minor 3 you also

451
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:46,220
 take out then mean of y okay so this is zero mean like yeah zero then the results will be very easy

452
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:56,220
 you know the the mean of y got a tool so it will be minor 3 multiplied by 2 minus 6 so again most of

453
00:56:56,220 --> 00:57:03,580
 the student this is a easy one so okay but then in terms of the variance there are many different

454
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:11,939
 solutions I always see is very interesting there are different ways some Spain a quite long page

455
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:22,380
 you know the if you look at the the first question so by right I try to give those basic in question

456
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:29,780
 one but because the question subperson a and b are very easy so I thought I have a lot blank page

457
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:39,460
 no use where the other question you need space so I move this subperson C actually belong to chapter

458
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:51,220
 a tool but okay so therefore in terms of the very easy way to do here I think many students did

459
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:59,340
 that is because you'll think no of the independent if the tool random variable x and y are independent

460
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:05,980
 they're independent you don't need to worry about cross term I mean by definition very in is you

461
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:16,140
 need to raise a power of 2 and then evaluate by it E and your n double is a cross term but because

462
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:27,620
 because it is independent so the cost term in in that case and then one of the variable is zero

463
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:40,020
 mean so so therefore our variant here you will be equal to the variance of of of the first part

464
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:51,140
 which is 2x and then and don't forget when you talk about variant you will never keep the minus side

465
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:59,460
 what you you will do is you can because minus one you'll take the power to become one so you can either

466
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:12,220
 do it do it directly 3 y okay you can the easy way is you follow the the property and then also change

467
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:20,540
 the minus side because you can basically something like you are squaring this a minus b then the cost term

468
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:27,900
 could be at a negative side but but when you when you square the other one it will be positive so

469
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:35,740
 therefore variant is a second order operation so therefore if you take the constant you must raise

470
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:43,779
 a power of 2 so you need to raise power 2 then multiply by variant of x and then similarly 3 you

471
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:52,460
 can take out but take the power of 2 and then y so there will be a very easy very easy solution

472
00:59:52,460 --> 01:00:01,420
 you don't need to start from the definition and so on so value of x equal to what one so it's 4

473
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:10,420
 multiplied by 1 plus 9 and then variance of y we already know is equal to 3 so that's so

474
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:19,540
 long sir current sir is still 4 plus 24 so it must be positive and 31 you are never be

475
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:27,540
 negative and won't be other value and you don't need to go through the very long that

476
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:34,340
 you may have derivation and even some still don't even deep by integration and so on which is not

477
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:46,940
 okay there's a not not the correct way to do so that's the so these two very basic are is more

478
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:56,940
 testing about basic knowledge about ring them variable mean and mean and value and for the

479
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:11,980
 subsequent see which is we can refer to the lecture note and normally the post kind of

480
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:24,060
 descriptive question mostly I based on you know the lecture notes so you win a filter then of

481
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:35,860
 course you'll look at how we let's see where is paid in this one only ask to draw the product

482
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:42,900
 green of the winner filter so that's the take also give you the good picture about how you

483
01:01:43,500 --> 01:02:02,180
 know defy the winner filter and also make it differ from the from the linear prediction one so so

484
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:10,300
 see here the program it will be just the one here but you need to mark in decay you see it will be

485
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:19,180
 input this is a major data you you have a signal plus noise coming in and then you go through this is

486
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:24,940
 the optimal linear filter or the winner filter we are defy but the whole picture you need to

487
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:32,820
 indicate this is the desirable signal we are going to match it's not as we call the S but just quite

488
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:43,580
 deep and then you so that's the one here and then the main difference if you can read this page you

489
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:54,860
 will be also also describe here because it's it cover the three for winner filter is you know it can

490
01:02:54,860 --> 01:03:07,220
 do all the this three three you know three processing filtering signal prediction and also

491
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:20,300
 signal signal smoothing yeah so but actually this is also yeah only yeah only when we refer to to

492
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:30,760
 refer to as you see you can sometimes also not very common you may want to have the

493
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:39,340
 signal which can even be even be different from the from from the S so but anyway so the main

494
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:50,020
 advantage will be comparing this one compare with the one step linear prediction filter so if you

495
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:59,860
 think most of the students this write down something or not necessarily keep the question maybe just

496
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:10,940
 putting down the words so would be consider consider correct it will be it will be better even if

497
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:21,020
 for even for linear prediction you see here the winner filter to do linear prediction is cover the

498
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:28,260
 one step prediction is a special case it's not not just one step you can predict several steps where

499
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:36,380
 you know the linear prediction with one step you can only do one step next so so that's also

500
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:47,500
 one of the one of the difference at DBO answer that will be considered considered considered

501
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:58,340
 correct and also remember the block diagram okay so this is the sub question C and how about the

502
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:15,380
 other sub question 2 so if a question 2 I I scan some of the good students through soon here so

503
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:24,660
 I see here this is a yeah one of the very good good and clear answer so if you if you the

504
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:32,819
 those students who can do the question to the two sub question correct then usually they will do the

505
01:05:32,819 --> 01:05:43,660
 the question one also mostly correct so they are at least they will be in the grade of a a plus so

506
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:51,740
 more kind near near full mark so see here this is a of course this one you'll need to remember the

507
01:05:51,740 --> 01:06:01,299
 one formula which is given in the lecture note also you can see here this this so you'll see

508
01:06:01,299 --> 01:06:12,500
 here in the we talk about lattice filter then there's a there's a conversion you see from yeah if

509
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:23,380
 you see from KM to AL you have to do step by step depending on on the order so so the so the

510
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:31,460
 formula use I will be just this formula but if you cannot remember then you will be hard to guess

511
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:38,900
 so so what you do like you see this this is one KM to AL and then if you are given AL will be use

512
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:48,420
 another formula so then you can see here you see this is starting from a 0 may a 1 and then and

513
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:58,460
 then you know step by step you will finally get get this and also because the for this there you can

514
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:06,540
 handle actually in our lecture note here we only teach about FIR filter we are we are doing it for

515
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:13,980
 FIR filter so that's that's a one when you get a for there will be there will be correct quite some

516
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:20,940
 student get this correct but then say the filter is one over this edge of jet which is not there

517
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:32,460
 I already highlight the filter is FIR filter even in the very beginning I say the notation you know

518
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:43,100
 in the announcement FIR should know the meaning of FIR so that's the way that's this one example

519
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:50,540
 this is another student this one also very good you write this formula and then again you see

520
01:07:50,540 --> 01:08:01,020
 the very similar so so in the end you'll get this so not much difficulty is just you know the way

521
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:08,660
 and this student even better you write as a fractional number so just I keep it here is fine

522
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:21,340
 because you take the ratio you will be the same as what other and then this one is is correct but

523
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:29,300
 then spend so much time to try the all the different way but in the end get I get the same

524
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:36,899
 result but probably it's good to start from the principle and then yeah is it here in the end

525
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:46,059
 you also get the same but the text very long page so I select this I think the I think a detail

526
01:08:46,059 --> 01:08:52,299
 there's no trick you once you apply this formula I think everyone can everyone can do if you are

527
01:08:52,299 --> 01:09:02,059
 if you're careful enough either this way or you do it do it in doing this way okay so so I hope

528
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:09,940
 this is not the problem and then come to the final sub question B for question for question 2 you see

529
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:23,260
 here so so again this one I won't say is is a mistake but initially if I'm very strict you see I

530
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:34,940
 state clearly is your heroes the Euler Walker equation to solve so I expect you know like

531
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:46,600
 you come out with you know these four student they all apply this some using a 4x4 matrix some

532
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:53,120
 reduce to you know this because the other body equal to zero so you can delete those

533
01:09:53,120 --> 01:10:03,800
 corresponding to zero so entire ways 4x2 also also 5 good and then you see here this one is 4x4

534
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:15,520
 and then this one long one is yeah 2x2 so the ideal one is only need 2x2 equation you know this 2x2

535
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:23,560
 square matrix you solve these two to value because minus on the autocorrelation minus one equal to

536
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:32,040
 one so once you get it because the the ring them for j is a first order so and they update you just

537
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:38,400
 recursive you can get the next value and so on so once you get there you will get the next value

538
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:44,879
 and then from next value you'll get the other one you are you will be just reduced by by half but

539
01:10:44,879 --> 01:10:57,280
 then it turns out to be the easy way to do at least if for for many students they use this

540
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:06,240
 motto and then because that's a first order and then easy way based on this Fourier jet transform

541
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:15,280
 you'll get this and then just once you have this you can evaluate them equal to 0 because

542
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:20,760
 autocorrelation always symmetry then this minus one you just try to test whether you know this

543
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:29,920
 property or start from 0 1 2 and it's very easy every time you reduce by half but the but the first

544
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:39,280
 one is you have to yeah you have to get this right you see so this but so initially I thought if

545
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:47,120
 you do not use this because that's a requirement then I may deduct some mark or at least some small

546
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:54,120
 but in the anger so many student majority using this way so I decide okay as long as you'll get

547
01:11:54,120 --> 01:12:04,200
 the answer correct you you do not apply these you'll be okay so I consider all correct that's why

548
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:16,040
 I end up with so many a plus probably 16 student will get a plus or a at least a so many many

549
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:25,320
 of them okay so so so that's why why in this because I also did not initially I did not realize

550
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:33,680
 the very simple way because this is a simple first order and they can do it but just to be careful

551
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:40,519
 if you the relationship are more complicated you may not be able to use this way you may really

552
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:48,480
 need to solve this this equation if one or the higher or the or you are given the auto correlation

553
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:59,480
 and then try to get this you will need to really solve this matrix equation usually 2 by 2 or and most

554
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:06,160
 3 by 3 so you don't need to go by 4 by 4 they will be because indicate it happened to be two of them

555
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:14,000
 are 0 then you can solve easily but if they are not 0 then it's very complicated okay you make a

556
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:25,720
 use of the relationship is recursive so you can once you go up to that order then after that you can

557
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:41,080
 do it recursively so that's yeah okay so yeah that's that's about the quiz and the solution yeah so

558
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:53,320
 any any question anything you like to ask or you want to comment maybe to auto discuss for for this

559
01:13:53,920 --> 01:14:15,120
 before we yeah maybe the more important one is try to try to prepare for the safe final exam paper so

560
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:31,120
 okay so let's see what I'm putting here some of them I prepared before but because some of the basic

561
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:39,559
 concept and most of mostly I just based on my understanding and handwriting so I hope I

562
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:52,480
 scan it so let's see here for this course what usually you can also see from the quiz and the

563
01:14:52,480 --> 01:15:02,640
 past past year exam paper so normally will be important as not necessarily just like maybe

564
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:10,720
 all the quiz I can have a question totally on you know ranked available probability of math but in

565
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:20,880
 the final exam paper normally will be more related to the say the statistical signal processing linear

566
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:28,400
 prediction or spectrum estimation so most study should be like the chapter 2 and 3 but it may use

567
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:36,799
 some of the techniques in the early part like the math and it will be one is linear algebraic like

568
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:47,519
 the matrix solving equation and so and some derivation to like simplify the you know based on the

569
01:15:47,519 --> 01:15:57,200
 past solution if maybe complicated you can file way to simplify and try to find out the

570
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:06,160
 solutions or in magic form if possible so that's one concept is very important like what I say very

571
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:14,280
 basic concept like a mean variant you know those are fundamental you you won't tell other people

572
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:20,080
 say the very equal to negative you know so this is something totally wrong so things like that

573
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:29,240
 that was why I asked that question and hope you know like this maybe learning from this mistake

574
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:38,000
 you'll get you are not make the same mistake or similar mistake before some block diagram that's

575
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:47,960
 like this not not many but usually some sub sub question part and then some computation also not

576
01:16:48,560 --> 01:17:00,360
 everyone so basically it's all around that concepts and some formulas also need to remember

577
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:10,000
 and then this one is I did it before I think this is one of the confusion and the difficult part

578
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:22,360
 in in this you know random process and so on because quite often students ask why we have we

579
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:32,520
 have two noise here and and then how are they related for example if we look at the random

580
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,480
 process the simple one is a AR model and the first order the one you just did for the quiz so

581
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:49,639
 you see here as I see the the relationship of this essay is you know we are trying to generate

582
01:17:49,639 --> 01:17:58,360
 this random process from for example from this from from this white noise and and like you can

583
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:07,599
 also view from signal processing for the view of white noise goes through filter and then the

584
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:17,920
 output will no longer why it become a no white you know like color noise process that kind of thing

585
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:28,000
 and then I'll date the ones you generate is a random process you measure the data your data is

586
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:35,160
 this random signal in another noise so you cannot say I compile this this this two noise they are

587
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:42,280
 they are they're totally different you see so although it looks like you know you can if you

588
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:49,120
 move this one to the right hand side you will be beta as n minus plus this so you may think about

589
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:59,440
 why can I plus that we cannot because our exchange only depending on s n it is for it's not s n minus

590
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:08,120
 one okay so you can think about this noise is more like the internal noise related to this

591
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:16,400
 random process the this AR process generally from this from this white noise that's why we call

592
01:19:16,639 --> 01:19:26,320
 innovation representation process and then once you have this random process there you are you

593
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:32,960
 try to measure this then you'll have the measurement noise you see okay so it's a measurement I think

594
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:40,000
 those nowadays actually there are some students from cca but nowadays cca some students are not

595
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,759
 from the control background for those having control background because actually I did my

596
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:51,880
 undergraduate in the auto automation like like this very much related to cca so you you have the

597
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:57,280
 space space space space you have the system noise you know like internal noise and ever

598
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:03,080
 that you'll you'll have the measurement equation which is the measurement noise so you always get

599
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:09,600
 used to two noise they are they're different they are even quite often to make the calculation

600
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:17,160
 easier we say they are uncorrelated or independent because it's also true because it comes from

601
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:24,400
 different process one is like the internal you know your state space is more though the

602
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:33,440
 dynamic system like yeah I for the other cause I talk about common filter which is state space

603
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:38,799
 representation where this one is a measurement noise okay so this is something I believe is a

604
01:20:38,799 --> 01:20:46,639
 very basic one it's not necessarily I mean most of the time the passable may teach a little

605
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:53,480
 test a little bit there but at least conceptually these are the important one after learning this

606
01:20:53,480 --> 01:21:01,919
 part two of this course and then give some detailed steps simplify results so along your answer try

607
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:10,800
 to not just jump to the solution also in the exams I assume it's very hard to memorize from some

608
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:21,680
 you know yeah so you what you try to get for be should be your own work but try it always try to

609
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:30,560
 derive something along the way and then in the end simplify some of the results some of the notation

610
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:41,200
 which is do also need to need to take note about that sometimes we call it power spectral density

611
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:50,080
 or PSD sometimes we call it power density spectrum they are basically the same yeah yeah then it

612
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:57,360
 yeah it also depends on you see here we we're writing in the power spectrum in terms of frequency

613
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:09,519
 sometimes we also extend it into into the jet I think it's some of the example I will give later

614
01:22:09,519 --> 01:22:16,000
 also nowadays I incorporate some of these into example in collection so just need to

615
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:25,679
 sometimes we're writing this way to explicitly write along the unicycle to this sometimes just

616
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:32,240
 because this is anyway those are constants so what the true variable is f is a frequency here

617
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:41,200
 then similarly auto correlation sometimes it can be x and x then sometimes just because

618
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:50,160
 autocorrelation you are the same x so you can write in this way cross correlation if dx is the

619
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:59,680
 common one you have two but sometimes the major signal is x we just write as d and then this one I

620
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:07,360
 fear is useful actually this revision every year I because I have taught this course for several

621
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:18,240
 years so I fear these are fundamental whether it's for exams or not and and these are also useful if

622
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:28,160
 you are for prone the part one because it's related to linear system a via although here we

623
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:37,360
 unless the air process which you can consider as a filter but most of time we are focused more

624
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:46,559
 via filter for like part one so so these are the very much relationship input output relationship

625
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:55,840
 linear system here and then for deterministic you I guess you'll learn it better x and n

626
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:03,760
 take j transform your v capital x of j and then this so improbable relationship is related by the

627
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:11,440
 transfer function it's just all the one linear and then frequency response you'll evaluate j along

628
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:18,320
 the unicircle you'll get this but however for random signal sometimes it's called stochastic you see

629
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:30,480
 you will not directly apply the j transform of x instead of from input signal x of n you'll get

630
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:37,040
 the autocorrelation okay then after that you'll take the j transform so that's why you know the power

631
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:44,640
 spectrum density sometimes we say in jet that means it will be the j transform of this one only

632
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:53,280
 when you evaluate along the unicircle it will become the power density spectrum is along the

633
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:58,720
 frequency but otherwise it could be extended to the whole to the whole jet plane and similarly

634
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:06,560
 why you also have this relationship and then different from the deterministic signal where

635
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:16,640
 improbable relative just directly the transfer function is here you have the the spectrum in the

636
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:24,400
 power spectrum in jet is improbable relative to the h of j multiplied by h z to the power minus one

637
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:31,360
 so so that's the that's a that would be the difference between dealing with random signal and

638
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:37,599
 deterministic one and then furthermore you'll evaluate you see jet along the unicircle you'll

639
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:43,920
 get this power spectrum density vst and then similarly this one you'll evaluate so you see here

640
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:51,440
 one of things is the jet your jet is always represented by this and jet to the power minus one

641
01:25:51,519 --> 01:25:57,839
 you will take the minus side here okay then this this is the complex so these two

642
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:06,799
 they are assuming of course here dealing with the real coefficient then you can write combine this into

643
01:26:07,519 --> 01:26:14,160
 magnitude raise of power two and that's how sometimes we start from here you should be able to

644
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:22,559
 go back to the edge of jet as called the spectrum factorization so you need to be familiar with this

645
01:26:25,599 --> 01:26:36,720
 okay these are the little bit of autocorrelation and cost correlation so here autocorrelation it

646
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:45,200
 doesn't matter you can start with xn and then n minus n because it's symmetry so yeah so that's why

647
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:55,280
 it's equal to m equal to minus n well cross correlation then is the order will be will be

648
01:26:55,360 --> 01:27:01,200
 important like m mean the dx n mean this argument is

649
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:13,679
 this one plus m so you mean you you can consider is n subtract this n minus n you'll get n so

650
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:19,519
 it's not equal to this this one you'll n start with minus n but cost correlation you don't have this

651
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:28,000
 symmetry as m will not equal to minus m in general so I think some students raise this question about

652
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:36,400
 why is so so make sure this is zero mean why saying stays in the little indom process and then this is

653
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:44,400
 the autocorrelation and therefore the variant of this because it's a ring done why you know we

654
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:53,040
 consider that is insane like a noise so you can also get the variant is it just equal to either e

655
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:59,440
 of this yn power of 2 take the expectation you see so that's the definition of variant but

656
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:06,000
 make sure this is zero mean not zero mean you will it will be different and then you can evaluate

657
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:15,120
 also is the autocorrelation at m equal to zero then this is always for autocorrelation that give you

658
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:25,920
 the largest value at zero okay some useful there's some firm pair I think this one I already this year

659
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:35,200
 I put into the lecture note also so yeah so you can directly use that's why many students use this in

660
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:43,679
 the in the quiz but don't forget there is this this is not one because many some students

661
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:51,440
 make a mistake by replacing it one it's to be one minus a square where this one is a one one over

662
01:28:51,440 --> 01:29:00,960
 this if you're on one side so you see here this is this is a more corresponding to autocorrelation

663
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:07,440
 where this is a more like like a one side one side series it's not the this one is not the

664
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:17,440
 autocorrelation okay okay I think this one this one I know in this year's lecture note I

665
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:27,680
 is more on those the dead tip signal processing so that's one of them another one is somehow

666
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:38,560
 yeah very similar to but maybe some of them are similar so I just show it here is yeah probably

667
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:47,120
 on different years so I think this one not okay because part of it are useful because I again I

668
01:29:47,120 --> 01:30:00,640
 try to relate relate DSP and ADSP here also so yeah so this one you know abaya filter you are all very

669
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:08,559
 familiar abaya then our case here for ring them signal sometimes we we're dealing with you seek

670
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:18,240
 to deal with MA moving average ring them process which you will be quite similar to this abaya filter

671
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:27,200
 and then IR filter for filter you will have this and then you can see this is one over this and then

672
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:36,000
 is also in ring them process we call it as AR process but then even this case the if you try to

673
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:44,080
 evaluate the even impulse response which different from every filter you won't get a finite number you

674
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:51,360
 will get to edge infinity there will be infinity many of them and then again you have a filter you

675
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:59,120
 have both numerator denominator so in this case corresponding to the armor model which is here

676
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:09,680
 and concept of causal and stable also very important so it should be no DSP so so again this is

677
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:18,720
 similar to what I say early but I emphasize on deterministic signal and variable you know so

678
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:26,480
 so these are more in the frequency response where ADSP you were yeah similar to what

679
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:36,400
 yeah I say early for if the input is a wide noise then you can simplify into that in general if the

680
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:46,639
 input no wide noise you have to have this part here okay yeah this is yeah you can make it more

681
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:56,560
 granular or if you are evaluating along the unicycle you can use the eurofomula to change it to a

682
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:08,560
 function of cosine omica here and filter you have a simple first order filter you want to evaluate

683
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:17,520
 this is the same as your this is called edge jack you see although you have the available is a jack to

684
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:24,320
 the negative power you can so you remember this is our filter and this one when you change the jack

685
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:32,160
 to the power minus one you have to replace this into jack no jack to the power one which is one jack

686
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:43,280
 okay today for if you're still using this you can yeah you can gain your entire with simple

687
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:53,920
 one in cosine omica and then you can see one corresponding to this you know the linear system

688
01:32:53,920 --> 01:33:00,240
 in the filter give you here and the other is input if assume the input here is you know the

689
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:11,040
 AR model then these two end up with a very similar expression you see yeah yeah yeah they can

690
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:21,040
 you can sometimes you can simplify you know the results depending on that so that's about some

691
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:33,200
 a decent notes I can yeah share with you the other than the lecture notes so so finally I will

692
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:44,240
 go through this lecture note again I will not go to chapter one because that's as I say that's I mean

693
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:50,719
 some of the relationship here like how to define a m or d or and so because they won anyway in the

694
01:33:50,719 --> 01:34:01,679
 later part we also use it so so only yeah those are if you use you can refer back but let me probably

695
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,920
 uh

696
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:17,920
 run through this and I will narrow down some of the some of the scope for the finite gen paper

697
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:25,920
 so it's uh

698
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:37,200
 okay I think the forward linear prediction you know these are very fundamental so I think this

699
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:48,800
 should know how to yeah how to do it how to write the equations and the brog diagrams and yeah and

700
01:34:49,200 --> 01:35:02,080
 and also uh the difference between a prediction error filter and the linear prediction filter because

701
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:13,120
 yeah so this tool will have some relation but there are difference this is the definition of the

702
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:22,000
 mean square error if you are dealing with complexity or at least and then you lead to this we will

703
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:33,599
 yeah I show how to get the optimal solution by taking the derivation so but the derivation

704
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:45,840
 uh for this solution uh will not will not be required here for the final exams so

705
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:54,320
 and this uh F. I. R. for all zero is it so latest filter this is for the

706
01:35:54,639 --> 01:36:03,599
 uh F. I. R. filter we actually for latest filter we only discussed this F. I. R. so you should

707
01:36:04,559 --> 01:36:14,080
 know the there are all the recursive equations and the the one you just did for the quiz is the

708
01:36:14,799 --> 01:36:23,440
 relationship between the K. M. and A. L. the one way to the other also uh yeah so they are

709
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:30,480
 basically just two formulas one convert into another one yeah once you remember this

710
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:39,120
 then you can yeah do it follow the examples and follow the follow the you know the quiz

711
01:36:39,839 --> 01:36:50,879
 question uh so this part is still uh required to uh to know or to memorize the formula and

712
01:36:51,680 --> 01:37:00,560
 similarly back rule linear prediction how's the relationship with uh forward and backward so

713
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:11,920
 you can yeah yeah try to learn one and then just just compare the difference and then yeah so the

714
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:22,720
 relationship of the coefficient will be here uh and then again the mean mean square uh one

715
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:32,960
 it's actually the result is the same but you don't need to solve it to derive and this equation the one

716
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:42,640
 like what we say early for the quiz these are the uh very very basic because this one also

717
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:49,280
 related to the Euler-Walker equation so I think some students I think you can see those students

718
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:56,480
 did write down these and then actually you can you you don't need this part because you if you

719
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:03,839
 know this is symmetry for autocorrelation yeah then you already know this so the one here is

720
01:38:03,839 --> 01:38:13,280
 remember in angle zero you have this noise value other than that is a recursive for AR so here we

721
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:22,080
 only need to know the AR and then the Euler-Walker equation there could be the one including this

722
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:32,480
 noise and all you can simplify by not include that one in to the other equation so from basically

723
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:43,840
 you're from one you can derive the other two okay so that's the one here solution of that you

724
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,040
 yeah so

725
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:48,400
 uh

726
01:38:51,519 --> 01:39:00,960
 yeah these are the example so uh and these two computational equation iteration this one

727
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:09,120
 you can uh ignore like this for I will exclude this from from exam the levy's to being algorithm so

728
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:17,920
 so yeah so no need to you can skip this part uh wiener filter the basic one is for all this

729
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:31,840
 relationship and then the design of wiener filter is only the FIA filter part you will see how to

730
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:42,320
 uh solve this either in several equations or you can uh yeah write into the magic form

731
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:51,600
 and then you'll compute the inverse inverse matrix so that's that's the one uh linking the

732
01:39:52,560 --> 01:40:03,440
 wiener filter and then follow the example like usually we're dealing with uncorrelated

733
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:09,920
 ring them processes so it will be much easier you don't need to consider the cost here

734
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:18,160
 yeah then follow the simple example and you know this is what we already discussed uh early

735
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,639
 okay yeah so

736
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:33,120
 also continuity principle think this one you can you can skip this one here yeah and like this this

737
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:42,400
 I have your wiener filter you can you can skip so no no need this part yeah including the example

738
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:50,240
 this is a quite good example but very uh complicated you need to have a very good understanding okay

739
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:59,120
 power spectrum uh basic concept about you know signal in noise uh whether early part or the later

740
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:06,639
 on these are the motivation of course you don't need to remember these uh figure these are from the

741
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:17,600
 many approach and so so yeah and uh no parametric method uh usually I will skip this whole

742
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:28,400
 no parametric section so you don't you can yeah you can if you don't have time you can skip this

743
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:41,120
 whole one parametric method we uh try to relate this into the uh the AR models and yeah so some

744
01:41:41,759 --> 01:41:52,160
 yeah basic definition for AR model you or yeah get the relationship and

745
01:41:52,960 --> 01:42:06,800
 and that's the rock diagram to try to yeah issue system-based PSPSE that's the basic step I think the

746
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:19,200
 maybe go to know this and then the algorithm for AR parameter estimation so should know

747
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:29,840
 how to convert from say one AR model and then from here to evaluate the power spectrum to do the

748
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:39,120
 power spec PSD power spectrum density so just so again this is we already learned in the early part

749
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:47,360
 so it's the same here just apply this so we will yeah this is also similar to the latest

750
01:42:47,599 --> 01:42:55,040
 uh filter it's the same relationship but uh we all yeah yeah I think this

751
01:42:56,240 --> 01:43:06,160
 optimal coefficient this is too formula or I will skip because too many formulas so you don't need to

752
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:13,920
 memorize these two we're not we're not test these two uh this page okay yeah and

753
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:26,480
 yeah these are the other quantities uh this one also can you can skip unconstrained least square

754
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:36,160
 measure yeah but then how to evaluate the one uh this is very much uh similar to the later part

755
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:42,160
 the icon measure you evaluate you'll get the power spectrum you will see the peak

756
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:53,200
 frequency uh very close to this one to the peak this one selection of AR model order can skip

757
01:43:53,200 --> 01:44:02,800
 this formula yeah no need yeah these two yeah okay uh how spectrum yeah these are the basic

758
01:44:03,519 --> 01:44:11,760
 MA is quite easy because you can you don't need really to solve your once you know the MA model

759
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:18,400
 you can directly use so this is the one uh related to the auto correlation

760
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,599
 uh AR

761
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:36,719
 AR model you know the expression of AR AR model and and then how to yeah so this one should be also

762
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:51,200
 good to uh yeah at least know the relationship from AR model to AR model and the MA MA model

763
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:57,200
 at least the expression simulation result because you don't need to you can skip all these

764
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:07,679
 uh speech application you're not yeah here no need this part this one so the this year the

765
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:16,160
 icon and energy method is you should know at least the some of the MA background and uh

766
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:26,480
 uh how to solve icon value icon vector orthogonal uh some very basic definition

767
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:36,559
 positive definite uh matrix and singular values here is for no square one is yeah the signal

768
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:44,559
 how to uh start from the yeah we always follow this signal in noise which is a random uh

769
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:57,360
 sequence and then the how to decompose into uh subspace and the singular value uh icon value

770
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:06,880
 also uh signal and noise subspace I explained earlier the orthogonalities and uh how it

771
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:17,360
 corresponding to the actual signal and noise so basic representation some property

772
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:29,200
 yeah okay so these are more profitable so this year I I will skip the from this page on

773
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:35,920
 PhD and music the actual computation because in the past two years you will see

774
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:45,440
 one one sub question related to either music or PhD so it turns out to be not so easy so this year

775
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:53,280
 it is already making a little bit easier so but then the early part the subspace one maybe

776
01:46:53,280 --> 01:47:04,639
 good to know the at least the meanings of of it and then the actual PhD and the music and all the other

777
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:14,559
 you know the yeah all these icon vector methods so on yeah you can you can skip from this

778
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:21,760
 PhD section on work so it's more like the understanding some of the

779
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:31,120
 concepts and at least the why we can use this uh icon uh decomposition

780
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:40,640
 analysis uh method uh up to yeah this okay I think uh I hope this help you to narrow down the

781
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:52,240
 some of the some of the topic so probably uh maybe at least uh near half or at least one third it's not

782
01:47:54,160 --> 01:48:03,280
 no include into the final exam yeah of course the exam paper you my power set two questions

783
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:10,240
 problem also two questions then we may have usually one two to three sub question so it

784
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:18,639
 cover some of these the one I say it will be possible to be exam but not of course not all the content

785
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:30,559
 so so you can try your best to yeah to to do the revision uh waiting the next two weeks about

786
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:41,120
 two weeks time okay yeah so uh yeah I will stop here and then since we still have time I did not

787
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:49,680
 take the break you know today so you can stay back if you have questions or if you have

788
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:56,720
 questions to discuss with other students you can also raise your hands and to see

789
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:08,080
 uh or your fear a little bit uh uh you prefer to later to discuss with me then it's also fine

790
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:16,480
 and of course always you're welcome you can email me so yeah I actually quite a some student

791
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:26,879
 already did that I uh I will yeah try my best uh yeah to see how I can help and a few students who

792
01:49:26,879 --> 01:49:35,519
 did not do well for the quiz because uh for this call only teeth half so it's uh I only do one quiz

793
01:49:35,519 --> 01:49:44,799
 as I can't help the those weaker students more for the other calls I 7402 uh actually I can

794
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:53,440
 share you a little bit is uh I did one assignment and one quiz because all by me so a few students

795
01:49:53,440 --> 01:50:00,240
 who did not do well in the assignment I personally at least I emailed them and then they did better in

796
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:09,120
 the in the quiz so I I compared but on nothing a few students I think probably they maybe did not

797
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:14,320
 do all the same by themselves they look quite okay all right I didn't know that's why I told them

798
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:21,040
 you're in assignment try not to try to do by yourself if you did not do well you'll get some

799
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:29,599
 warning then you you prepare better increase and the final exam so usually it works better

800
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:35,200
 because for the whole course but then this course unfortunately I only teeth half so I I can't I don't

801
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:43,679
 have time to yeah so but anyway I still alert a few students really need help maybe they

802
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:50,240
 came from different background like computers or not learning the related course

803
01:50:51,679 --> 01:51:00,639
 before so it's a big difficult to catch up but anyway as I say I already cut down some contents

804
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:13,680
 and then I also prepare some related material in DSP filter spectrum and all those should be useful

805
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:22,960
 and then causal filter stable filter which we also need here the concept okay so I think that's

806
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:33,760
 overall I hope you yeah at least you'll learn something useful here and I hope that maybe useful

807
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:43,920
 in your future study or or future project or some of you did you know PhD or going to do

808
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:54,160
 PhD or you are currently doing your dissertation project and so on so yeah so anyway yeah it's

809
01:51:54,160 --> 01:52:04,400
 a good to to see you here staying to the last lecture of this semester I may see some of you

810
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:13,200
 next semester if you are mostly or you're a new student you still need to take course away

811
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:26,320
 we're offering a new course next semester I'm teaching even yeah a few weeks there so so perhaps

812
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:32,320
 because next semester there will be this course will repeat but of course you'll I hope I don't

813
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:38,560
 see you here again because unless one very few of you fair then you may repeat but

814
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:46,400
 fortunately not so but then 7402 there's a not offering semester two because some of you

815
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:55,760
 sticking the one but the only one one once per year but the next next next semester and teaching

816
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:59,760
 another course more related to machine learning yeah there are also some

817
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:09,840
 mass related equation and so on so anyway I hope maybe see you again by at least building the

818
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:17,520
 exam because I'm the examiner invigilator so if not seeing you if you don't have a question

819
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:26,960
 then I will see you at least in the exam hall so yeah anyway for SPM or ML student because

820
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:36,720
 I think I still quite often in touch with you so I hope yeah okay all the best and good luck to all

821
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:49,680
 of you and yeah so see you see you again yeah thanks for coming and for attending this course

822
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:54,400
 so I very much appreciate okay good see you

823
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:20,400

824
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:50,400
