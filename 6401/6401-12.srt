1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So it's good to have proper lectures for the first hour and then we will do the quiz

2
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,720
 after the break.

3
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:55,920
 So everyone come back by 7.50 and for those who are not here, anyway, they will not be

4
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:04,720
 able to get my message until after the quiz is over because it's a video recording, not

5
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,039
 the online lecture.

6
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:22,360
 So anyway, I can assure you the quiz question will not be too difficult, probably compatible

7
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:32,280
 with previous years and there are also probably one or two so-called Song Feng tea.

8
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:41,000
 So I will see if the students make mistake on that very simple one then I think probably

9
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:52,720
 it will be, I will see actually we are fighting out students who did not do well if the students

10
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,640
 like those under AW from certain university then we will consider raising path.

11
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:08,720
 So I hope everyone, I mean not only for yourself but for your previous university because it

12
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,520
 may affect the so-called names.

13
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:24,840
 So this is some side story because I'm your provident, I'm one of the program directors

14
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:35,520
 so we are looking into this particularly since August this year we have many more students

15
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:44,360
 so I think this semester will be a so-called benchmark because we have more students then

16
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,840
 I hope the performance will not drop that significantly.

17
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
 Okay.

18
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:03,200
 Yeah, actually we will do some groupings later but I think some of you took my course in

19
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:14,680
 the next door, LT19 last week so today I will show you I will do a better job to see you

20
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
 properly.

21
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:28,640
 So we are going to that later on as I say we still have some lecture not finished yet

22
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:39,920
 chapter 3 and I'm not rushing to do all the remaining part because we only have about

23
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,720
 one hour.

24
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:53,280
 Anyway, next week we will still, you see have time to finish the, just leave a little bit

25
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:03,200
 of chapter 3 more of the application or some methods.

26
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:13,880
 So I think this is week 12 and no choice I have to finish grading your marking your

27
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:23,680
 quiz within one week so hopefully next week I come back the final lectures I can also

28
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
 discuss briefly.

29
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:35,359
 Particularly the so-called Song Feng Ti Wui, any student cannot do or make a serious mistake

30
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,760
 or not.

31
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:48,560
 So anyway let's see later for the 7402 they are in general okay but they are, I can say

32
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:59,160
 for quiz there are at least two or three student fairs, I mean below 40 marks out of 100 so

33
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,760
 so I hope you can do a better job here okay.

34
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:15,880
 So let's, so last week we start from the power spectrum estimation.

35
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,800
 So this course if you look at the lecture note it's not that many pages but the contents

36
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:34,840
 quite things and also requires not just math, statistics also signal processing like DSP

37
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:44,680
 and so on and yeah but as I say for quiz and final exams will exclude certain difficult

38
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:54,280
 parts such as IRR, Wiener filter which is most difficult one.

39
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:05,080
 So let's have a very quick review I won't go into detail but I would like to perhaps

40
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,760
 give more overall pictures here.

41
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:20,360
 So let's see, power spectrum estimation is just like you see if you are learning DSP

42
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:28,280
 you have the frequency response you see and you have time domain given some time domain

43
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:36,800
 signal speech or deal because here our course is not like image where most students still

44
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:49,560
 based on like 1D signals which is the basic and the starting points and then we, let's

45
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:58,320
 see here given the signal in time domain actually I hope that your level MSE or yeah some PSD

46
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:08,200
 or so you should have much better understanding why do we want to go to frequency domain because

47
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:16,120
 in time domain sometimes you know if you have two signal which is very, looks very similar

48
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:25,240
 in the waveform and noise sometimes very heavy then very hard to look from time domain to

49
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,440
 separate the signal.

50
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:34,919
 So frequency domain is at least in some sense you see if you have signal with periodic signal

51
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:41,520
 from different frequency then we go to the frequency domain you can look at the different

52
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,280
 frequency component can even tell which one is the stronger signal and so on.

53
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:59,959
 So this is one very basic of the motivation and DSP is mostly for deterministic and for

54
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:09,839
 so called maybe signal in noise but not really looking at the signal itself range but in

55
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:19,600
 the advanced level like this course in the 7402 we are also looking at even useful signal

56
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:27,520
 but they are ranked them in some sense such as here we have so called sideways but it's

57
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:36,320
 not totally deterministic in part of the primary typically like the phase it could be ranked

58
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:46,560
 them and in such a case how are we going to handle to detect this kind of harmonic or

59
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:57,240
 sideways or you know and that's also similarly we have the frequency domain approach by taking

60
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:05,880
 say Fourier transform but here since we involve random signal so we cannot just simply like

61
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,400
 in the time domain we directly take the Fourier transform and look at the spectrum.

62
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:22,000
 So here we are looking into higher level like the second order statistic which involves

63
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:32,360
 starting with autocorrelation as you do autocorrelation cross correlation and there are that why because

64
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,360
 children may ask why do we go through that? Actually we are looking more carefully doing

65
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:45,920
 autocorrelation it's reduced or at least it gets some more deterministic features from

66
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:57,880
 the random signals. It's kind of taking the average in some sense so after that we can

67
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:06,360
 take the Fourier transform and we get the spectrum information and it's more reliable.

68
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:20,080
 So that's the similarity and difference taking this advanced DSP assuming probably this most

69
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:31,280
 of you you took the DSP. So and then we start from the motivation you see because finite

70
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:38,840
 duration and noise so there was one of some of the main reason we're looking at that and then

71
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:49,520
 there you can see these three measures they are closely related but in a different way.

72
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:59,240
 No parametric it's just a directory work on the given signal to extract the spectrum

73
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:11,680
 information from there. So this is more classical and easy to apply but the result for unless

74
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:22,240
 for very simple and clear signal otherwise it's not I would say very classical. It's also the

75
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:33,800
 earlier and the other day we moved to parametric. In fact it's to somewhat closely related. We

76
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:45,880
 should say we start with a more traditional parametric which is like AR model. We look at

77
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:55,560
 rational spectrum starting from rational function and then estimate those coefficient. So and

78
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:03,280
 they are moving on this is eigen and energy is considered relatively modern although it also

79
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:18,839
 has been several decades at one time is a very popular research topic in the early years for

80
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:28,480
 those before I told this course for me for five or six years but before that this was not in part

81
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:41,320
 of the curriculum so I think eigen energies is quite useful because you can apply to some of the

82
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:53,920
 even more recent research direction such as at one time quite popular like the compressed

83
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:04,800
 same things and actually even nowadays subspace analysis even in image analysis you see are

84
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:14,680
 doing clustering this subspace concept is very very useful. So I will say this is part of the

85
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:25,880
 parametric but it's a more elegant approach and then it has a wider application but given this

86
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:34,439
 limited hours or weeks and then including we are doing the quiz in part of the course here. So the

87
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:46,400
 introduction would be rather brief so but the the the maths there also a little bit complicated

88
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:58,080
 because in both you know magic theories and also we include like complex complex variable

89
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,880
 in into into discussion because in some of the methods once you involve Fourier transform as

90
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,400
 you all know you are going to the frequency domain which you involve complex number so you can

91
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:24,920
 really avoid that. So I hope you maybe also learn you know how to handle complex number and so

92
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:33,560
 on. Okay so yeah so very quickly you go through some of the maths background which I already did

93
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:43,239
 last week but I will highlight the more important or more difficult one I think square matrix which

94
00:15:43,239 --> 00:16:00,439
 you can get the eigenvalue eigen vector I think this one should be very very basic requirement and

95
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:09,080
 then in particular if for low dimension low mean two or maximum three I think three by three

96
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:19,320
 matrix as you can see some of the past year papers not every year but it does appeal so you

97
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:33,240
 need to know how to be able to get the determinant you see here you Kramer Kramer Lu is you see you

98
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:40,920
 want to get this determine you take any one row one column okay say one row then first element

99
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,800
 then cross out then look at this determinant two by two then two by two matrix everyone know how to

100
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:55,880
 get the get a determinant cross multiply subtract cross and then multiply and then the next one which

101
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:04,079
 you change the minus sign and then also do the same cross out this then you will get the determinant

102
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:12,599
 and the better and this one usually you'll choose one has at least probably one zero like this at the

103
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:19,079
 first one they don't need to you don't need to calculate this on your g low multiply anything

104
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:29,320
 become g low so you only have two okay in this case you can also do some simplification first yeah

105
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:36,600
 yeah that's how I even get get the stats so it's on plus this one you have the star with a minor one

106
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,399
 and no include this one this minor one except it's already there so you need to add another

107
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:51,240
 multivibrant minor one expand and then it become a third order polynomial then make it equal to zero

108
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:58,520
 or do the factorization and so on and then once you'll get the eigenvalue you can start to get the

109
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:06,680
 eigenvector so this is a little bit more difficult because you will need to be familiar with solving

110
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:17,160
 system of equation because one of these become zero three that also tells you the very concept about

111
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:26,040
 the ring of matrix eigen for eigenvalue once you're putting the end them in this

112
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:33,639
 matrix it reduces the ring by at least one so typically reduce one become two so two ring

113
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:44,520
 matrix among the three rows two and most two of them are linearly independent so you can

114
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:52,680
 just take any two and then you see you have you have two equations three variable so one of them is

115
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:04,680
 redundant so you use that as you know it's a free parameter and you can solve so this you know some

116
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:11,880
 students find it difficult to solve but try try your best to yeah review so once you solve then

117
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,440
 there you see this is a so-called free parameter then there are many many choice you can scale this

118
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,840
 vector as long as no zero but they have to too many how are we going to choose

119
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,840
 normalization that's right this is also you know some of the some of the steps you use are very

120
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:41,480
 common across different subjects different areas such as in you are doing machine learning your

121
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,440
 wrong neural network normally you cannot just get any data then putting you have to do some

122
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:54,120
 pre-processing and normalization is a typically one requirement normalization means you see here the

123
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:07,320
 norms will be normalizing to one so remember we're dealing with probably a complex value also so you

124
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:16,280
 you need either take absolute value or you need to multiply a complex number with the complex conjugate

125
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:27,720
 in order to make it into into the so-called positive positive value okay so I will go into that later

126
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:39,879
 in some of the examples yeah so I think these are very clearly stay here and then unitary

127
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:50,680
 metrics also very important because that involved also go now you see if you have two two two vector

128
00:20:50,680 --> 00:21:00,760
 they are also go now so yeah then if all the either all the column or all the rows they form an

129
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:10,600
 orthonormal set then you will have this nice property because you know no singular

130
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,600
 metrics you can you always have inverse of course assuming here we are dealing with square

131
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:25,960
 metric one matrix multiplied by its inverse become i but taking the inverse big very very

132
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:35,080
 troublesome particularly for big metric so so this a matrix you take the Hermitson Hermitson

133
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,440
 means you because here remember we are dealing with complex number so you'll take the complex

134
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,440
 conjugate conjugate is you'll keep the real part unchanged then the imaginary part you'll change

135
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:53,480
 the side maybe yeah and then after that for matrix you also need to do the transfer

136
00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:04,280
 so these two operations combined together with Hermitson yeah let's see where this

137
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:10,120
 is

138
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,560
 definition

139
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:21,879
 okay yeah basically you yeah you will be taking the

140
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:31,399
 transfer and at the same time take the complex conjugate so this one is illustrating

141
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:41,880
 about if you have the some useful properties so for example if you are having a Hermitson

142
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:50,440
 matrix where here we are talking about eigen eigen value eigen analysis so must be a square

143
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:59,480
 matrix if you are doing singular decomposition you'll allow a no no square metric so so this

144
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:09,720
 property let's see we start with this and then we have eigen vector which is normalized UK and this is

145
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,640
 eigen value we already know you can always find the one but then for Hermitson

146
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:28,040
 matrix that means satisfy this they have some very useful property so maybe one of them is

147
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:35,080
 you'll see the all the eigen value they will be rare as if for

148
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:44,360
 a channel in channel you you may have some complex eigen value let's see with this one

149
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,360
 okay

150
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,159
 okay so let's maybe maybe quick

151
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:27,560
 derivation and explanation about how you handle like complex or what's mean by complex conjugate okay so

152
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,040
 uh

153
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:44,679
 to to start with if you all look at just a very simple say say two by two if I have one plus two

154
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,680
 uh

155
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,320
 j for example

156
00:24:52,120 --> 00:25:07,400
 then you also maybe for the diagonal element I make it clear and then you will have one

157
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,120
 uh

158
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:16,520
 minus j one plus j so so let's look at this

159
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,760
 this matrix versus complex so if you all if you all just do a simple

160
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,320
 uh

161
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:35,720
 transfer as if so there will transfer of course you all know diagonal element you'll you'll keep the same

162
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:44,360
 but the off diagonal in this case two by two then you'll just uh change uh exchange this at this position

163
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:55,400
 okay so after transfer these two are not the same okay however the Hermitson you see if I

164
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:05,880
 now if I start with the same the same matrix one minus j one plus j and then three if I take this

165
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:16,520
 Hermitson operation uh it going to mean you're you're doing the two operations at one after

166
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,840
 you can do transfer first okay uh okay and then uh after that you'll do the complex

167
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,680
 conjugation uh you these two operations you can do complex conjugate first and then do the transfer

168
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:39,320
 is the same you can uh exchange so we already done this you'll transfer you'll get this uh and then

169
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:47,960
 after that you'll do you'll do one more step by the by the conjugate you see then after taking the

170
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:57,000
 conjugate you you'll uh become you see the conjugate is the real part is the same as one but the

171
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,679
 imaginary part you'll change the side and similarly similarly this one

172
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:15,480
 okay so so in this case you can see uh this given given matrix here if you take transfer

173
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:23,800
 only it will not be equal to itself but if you take transfer and then follow by the uh conjugate

174
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:31,080
 that's we call the Hermitson Hermitson operation then it become become itself

175
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:41,000
 okay beautiful complex and and that's a very very important property to hang those

176
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:53,240
 complex number complex matrix okay so this is uh at first thing you should be familiar

177
00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:00,200
 with this because we talked about a lot the Hermitson operation here and the I think the

178
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:09,080
 lecture note here is not not very clear about uh is it given this one we can let multiplying this

179
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:16,840
 from both sides uh and then uh here I want to explain the meaning of this you see this if I have uh

180
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:30,679
 you okay and then remember for uh a vector a low vector when you take the Hermitson operation it will

181
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:41,720
 become a low vector and at the same time you also need to do the conjugate operation so for example

182
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:55,240
 if uh if this is uk here okay then you you uh our uk uh h you will become uh first you'll

183
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:04,360
 you'll uh do the transfer so uh column become a low and now with that this is the first operation

184
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:11,879
 is very easy things look column and row is just simply uh you know graphically you can see and

185
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:18,600
 now there you'll you'll take another complex conjugate if if there are complex elements

186
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:25,080
 so one question is if all the elements are real of course the real you're equal to itself you see

187
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:32,760
 because uh if you don't have the imaginary part you don't need to change the sign I mean it's zero

188
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:40,040
 so that's how this is done here so uh and then uh follow this uh the uh ebio

189
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:50,840
 to this operation uh vector column vector uh multiply from the left hand side by this uh

190
00:29:51,560 --> 00:30:03,720
 uh Hermitson Hermitson operation then you uh in this course I since I only teach half so I did not

191
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:13,480
 spend too much time talk about this uh block block box box method I think uh I mean uh just very briefly

192
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,919
 it's it's quite useful very often you're if you're dealing with a matrix you don't need to

193
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,760
 most of time you don't need to write down the actual element you know very often you'll you'll just

194
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:33,640
 give the size give the block uh like how many num rows how many columns in in this way then it's

195
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:41,640
 very clear you can you can see in this case it will become a scalar you see this is uh you know

196
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:49,720
 row vector followed by a column vector it will become a scalar uh okay and on that thing if you're

197
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:59,160
 doing uh other way around uh actually not here but just a side side product if you do to this way

198
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:06,520
 you'll just start with a column followed by row then the matrix will be will be totally different

199
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:17,800
 you see you'll end up with a very big square matrix in in such a case okay so this is the two different

200
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:26,600
 operation and anyway this this is very often we're also writing in writing this form is

201
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:36,919
 is uh uh early on we talk about the the l2 norm uh and then the for if you uh take the

202
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:45,480
 l2 norm you will need to take take the square root because this is a one by one a scalar a positive

203
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:54,199
 value uh but then uh quite often we taking square root is a very inconvenient so we square it uh

204
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,720
 then there will be the operation sometimes we're calling it as a inner product because

205
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:10,440
 you're multiplying the vector and the her mission transform itself you will be able to so the meaning

206
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:21,960
 of uk you know this double vertical bar and num2 we're taking the l2 norm or it's related to the

207
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:32,280
 distance if you are looking into the 2d space or in the nd nd space okay so uh

208
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:40,760
 so therefore this this part is very clear if you multiply this one uh there of course the

209
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,840
 matrix you cannot take out but you'll make reviews of this property okay you're doing there and then

210
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,760
 a scalar you can take out so therefore your nwc this part is not

211
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:01,240
 not very clear we want to we want to derive and make good good use of this property from here

212
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:11,159
 and then to see uh you see somehow we are taking the conjugate of this of this icon

213
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:20,440
 icon value uh because we uh we don't know in general the icon value may be complex so how to

214
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:33,560
 how to uh how to verify that there are there are several ways to do the the easiest way to use is

215
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:43,960
 uh you see here uh since we want to look at the so-called conjugate you see conjugate and then

216
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:53,720
 also nwc we multiply with the same norm uh we we want to derive this uh from here

217
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:03,160
 uh into this so so to do that the one way to do as I say here there are several ways by the way

218
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:12,040
 we look at uh one of them this is the given one you see the lambda k uk this is by definition if I

219
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:21,080
 take the take the Hermitian of of both uh when you are dealing with equation you see you do one

220
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,799
 operation on the left hand side make sure you do the same on the right hand side so that they were

221
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:34,120
 they will still be equal okay and then let's look at the look at the left hand side uh your nwc

222
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:46,679
 uk uh Hermitian any operation if you apply to a product of two metrics uh always make sure

223
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:55,239
 you break down uh you will uh uh if you have two the the the right hand side one you have to

224
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:02,919
 bring it bring forward uh then it applies to you're taking the transport taking the inverse and so on

225
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:11,000
 so same with this Hermitian you see your uk Hermitian first then followed by the m also

226
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:18,680
 also Hermitian you see so this is from the left hand side that there's no problem because this is

227
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:27,800
 where uh doing the using the basic rule it works for any vector metrics and so on and how about the

228
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:35,960
 right hand side uh because the right hand side one of them is a scalar once you have a scalar

229
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:44,920
 multiplied by a vector or by a matrix you uh you don't need to change the change the order because

230
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,040
 a scalar multiplied with a matrix or a vector you can always put your left or right you see

231
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,920
 there but as long as you're a vector or magic you cannot okay so let's look at this uh if it will be

232
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:05,400
 namda k hermitian and then also i have the i have the uk transpose here okay

233
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:17,960
 then uh what next we want to uh we want to create something relative to relative

234
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:29,000
 create this okay then naturally you'll be you'll be thinking uh for this one is uk transpose m and

235
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:37,560
 then this this uk so this one will be modeled by left left hand from this side then why don't i do the

236
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,759
 one from the right okay so i i multiply uh

237
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:59,640
 uk uh from uh a vector from the right hand side then your n-tab with uh this uk h uk right correct

238
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:08,920
 okay so this one is what we are calling is the norm as we already defined

239
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:19,799
 defined early so now we uh in this way the right hand side we we create this one all right okay then

240
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:29,400
 early on we already derived here equal to equal to this so the only difference is the middle of

241
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:41,560
 m h here where this is m but we already know m equal to m h so so therefore this is equal to uk h uh m

242
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:55,000
 uk and this one uh also where we didn't know is equal to lambda k uh without h uh uk h uk okay

243
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:03,400
 so this one is the same uh therefore uh if uh a scalar

244
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:14,440
 multiplied by this no zero no zero positive value and if this scalar take the scalar you'll take the

245
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,920
 Hermitian it's just simply just do the complex conjugate you see uh then they are they are equal

246
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,920
 so this uh lambda k must be real so you can i think this is uh uh probably

247
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:39,080
 so if i ask you to verify in the final step i think you should have everyone can do that yeah

248
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:47,240
 right if not then you'll start with the definition of the complex conjugate number okay so from here

249
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:56,040
 you can you can conclude this lambda k must be real because our lambda k is just any eigen

250
00:38:56,759 --> 00:39:05,720
 eigenvalue okay so this is the one you can you can you you can be right by doing this kind of

251
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:15,560
 simple property and operation similarly this uh if the two eigenvalues are not the same then

252
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:28,040
 you can you can be sure this the corresponding eigenvector they are uh they are also going to

253
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:35,240
 uh each other so that means this uh in the in your product of the two different vectors

254
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:44,120
 it will be equal to zero so again you you follow a similar argument uh starting from the definition

255
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:53,640
 of eigenvalue eigenvector uh then you can operate and you will surely get get a conclusion this one

256
00:39:53,640 --> 00:40:01,720
 must be equal to uh equal to zero so this is a very important uh in in both concepts if we

257
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:11,799
 denote this in in matrix uh now assume uh all the eigenvalue they are real because we're property

258
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,880
 one for Hermitian matrix they must all be real and then if they are all different so they will be

259
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:25,080
 very good you put all these eigen eigenvector one by one to form a square matrix and these are the

260
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:36,440
 corresponding diagonal diagonal uh matrix then you can verify this and can be decomposed in such a way

261
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:48,840
 you and then this diagonal and this is you of you of edge so this is uh a very very convenient way

262
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:57,800
 okay and that's uh a very useful property is positive definite

263
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:07,320
 definite matrix and uh i think most of you should be familiar with a real if the matrix is a real

264
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:18,760
 then you can uh you can just take uh no zero no zero vector a real and then multiplied by its

265
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:29,640
 transfer you see but the same property you can extend into complex complex complex matrix but

266
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:38,600
 but make sure these low matrix you have to do the conjugate so that uh in the end this becomes a

267
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:47,960
 scalar you see if you if you are not sure why the vector matrix you multiply become a scalar as you

268
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:56,680
 again if you use this simple box box measure you you just write down the the dimension as you hear

269
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:05,240
 to be compatible this one must be uh you see the number of column must be the same as the number

270
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:13,560
 of row here then in the end this product it will be it will become a one by one matrix which is of

271
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:22,840
 course a scalar so being a scalar uh in general if you're doing uh habitually choose some vector and

272
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,640
 matrix complex then you may end up with a complex number or you end up with a negative value or

273
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:38,040
 may end up with a zero value but if you have this spatial matrix for whatever is it so this v is not

274
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:45,400
 just if you verify just with one is not enough you'll have to exhaust you know search of course

275
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:51,480
 theoretically you can it will be very difficult you cannot do even now they very powerful computer

276
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,640
 no one is going to do that because this this kind of no zero vector is infinitely many so there are

277
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:07,080
 ways to test but i won't go into detail here but yeah just the definition is yeah you can yeah if you

278
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:16,279
 satisfy that then there will be a positive definite matrix and because of this property any

279
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:25,319
 assume this one is it doesn't satisfy the commission you can do some operation to make it

280
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:33,640
 commission so i think we will not do go through this kind of kind of step actually is easier we

281
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:43,400
 assume any positive definite matrix you just assume will be a commission already satisfied the

282
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:52,759
 commission commission matrix so these are the ways to so-called convert we will not go into that

283
00:43:52,759 --> 00:44:00,279
 okay so these are the very useful and then now you can explain this eigenvalue decomposition into

284
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,480
 singular value decomposition actually singular value decomposition is equally powerful or in

285
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,760
 something even more powerful because it works for no square no no square matrix of course

286
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,920
 singular value decomposition based on eigen eigenvalue decomposition you'll need to learn

287
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,640
 eigenvalue decomposition you need to have eigenvalue decomposition in order to apply to

288
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:32,040
 singular value decomposition so so so the way to do is for any no square matrix you can

289
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:40,600
 also do the decomposition but only difference here the diagonal element is the same you know it

290
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:49,240
 looks like they are all positive but all depending on the ring if the matrix of ring

291
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:56,600
 are then you have out of them not equal to zero they are actually positive but the

292
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:04,680
 left matrix and right right matrix here there are both unitary unitary matrix mean all the columns

293
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:13,560
 of rows they are they are orthogonal and but they are they are in general different different in

294
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:23,880
 both in size and also they are not having the same element not the same matrix in eigenvalue

295
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:30,840
 decomposition you have the same matrix just take the commission but here they are different okay

296
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:45,320
 then you can yeah you can also for for special square matrix which is of ring r in this case

297
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:51,880
 semi positive definite being you don't need to be greater than zero it can be greater or equal to zero

298
00:45:52,760 --> 00:46:01,480
 and not necessarily full ring also it can be smaller ring compared to this then this way the

299
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:09,080
 corresponding singular value decomposition see here it becomes like the very similar to our

300
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:18,680
 eigen decomposition except here the diagonal element is always you you you are square you see

301
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:27,399
 you are always once you're square will be always always positive but then it allows to have some

302
00:46:27,399 --> 00:46:36,600
 zero singular value because the ring is only r so so it's and typically we all the the largest one

303
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:45,720
 first and then sequentially going down okay and then the ring to equal to r so you will stop at this

304
00:46:46,279 --> 00:46:54,919
 after they become come zero that's right semi definite now we want to relate it to our what we

305
00:46:54,919 --> 00:47:05,080
 learned about you see the auto correlation matrix which is very useful in signal processing in the

306
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:14,600
 random signal or statistical signal processing so so again here we are in general dealing with

307
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:25,560
 this positive possibly complex value so remember what I say here this is column vector first

308
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:34,440
 followed by a row vector so it's an outer product it will be become square matrix you see

309
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,839
 other way around it will be in the product and then because they are random you see so we

310
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:49,400
 take the expectation and and so you see here auto correlation is somehow you're

311
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:56,440
 you're take using expectation to reduce the randomness and become a

312
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:07,880
 metric here which is in Hermitian it could be positive semi definite semi positive definite

313
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:14,920
 sometimes it's a positive definite sometimes it could be just semi positive definite it's not

314
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:22,600
 not free okay then you'll pay some the definition and this expectation as you hear the

315
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:30,440
 outer product you become matrix but to take expectation you need to know the

316
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:40,280
 PDF for building the function of this of this data then multiply and then do the integration

317
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:49,720
 usually this become a bit complicated and based on this property we know this metric is

318
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:57,480
 Hermitian because you can take the operation of the Hermitian operation on this so

319
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:08,200
 satisfy this furthermore if you now we have this matrix so our definition want to see whether

320
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:17,400
 is semi positive definite you need to multiply need no zero vector which is not random you see so this

321
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:24,840
 x of n is random this w is not random you see so one from the right then there is it could be

322
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:33,080
 complex from the left then you're parking and do a little big simplification n dot with this is again

323
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:40,120
 positive value is a norm 2 you see greater or equal to zero then this kind of integration

324
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:45,800
 you will always n dot with greater or equal to zero because of this property

325
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:57,960
 okay now we move one step further to a more practical setting and we did that for many times

326
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:06,760
 in the chapter 2 and for those taking 7402 this is also a very basic assumption signal or

327
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:15,880
 in noise okay and yeah and this is and here noise we just assume is like white noise of

328
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:27,080
 of variant go to sigma w power 2 then both are statistically independent so this is very important

329
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:32,680
 let me you don't have the you you are not give give a constant because when you

330
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:48,839
 multiply you see plus you make it multiply from as a even outer product is similar to the

331
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:56,759
 to the square square link operation so from two term your n dot n dot is four terms so

332
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:02,440
 that means you have a two cross term here but because of this statistically independent

333
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:13,960
 it will the cross term will become become zero so you only have the signal the so-called

334
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:21,720
 or auto correlation of the signal auto correlation of the noise to accept and and this one because

335
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:31,640
 white noise and then you n dot with this very special noise covariant matrix and this is in

336
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:40,279
 general for the signal we can't say much okay and because it's permission and semi positive

337
00:51:40,279 --> 00:51:48,439
 definitely in general then based on what we learned can decompose into this sbd in this way and

338
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:56,920
 it has this eigenvalue up to here then this np is the ruin of the is okay and then

339
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:05,000
 because the noise covariant matrix at this very space very special structure so

340
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:13,720
 you can verify very easily once you do the singularity commotion for the is by adding this one

341
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:27,640
 you you will still n dot with the eigen eigenvector of this ix and the is x and is at the same

342
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:33,399
 but the eigenvalue will be different or the singular value because here this is the singular

343
00:52:33,399 --> 00:52:39,720
 very difficult you are basically just adding up the noise and the noise is white so it's cross

344
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:48,600
 all over the place or all the you see so every diagonal you just add this and so that's easy to

345
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:56,680
 verify and then you can see some property also here this r of x this is dealing with the signal

346
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:05,240
 noise no singular if we have noise so so that's why in some applications adding noise is useful

347
00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:14,600
 because noise helps you to make the matrix from the from a singular to become become like a full

348
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:24,839
 ring in in this case and then the is is different eigenvalue but the same eigenvector as this is

349
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:31,240
 because of course we assume the noise is white so here this property otherwise if it's not white

350
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:37,160
 then you cannot have this and for the more if we assume we have the

351
00:53:39,479 --> 00:53:49,399
 you know lambda of k is the case eigenvalue then those are beyond this np plus one and so on they

352
00:53:49,399 --> 00:53:59,080
 are all equal to the noise the eigen the value of the noise and that's equal to the to the minimum

353
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:07,960
 singular value of this rx because remember we all the the value from largest all the way to

354
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:17,799
 the smallest one so therefore this is one way if you all you don't know this noise

355
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:29,720
 value but you are able to get this rx then you can do a singular value decomposition and then

356
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:38,280
 from the smallest eigenvalue of this rx you can you can file assuming of course the the n the number

357
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:45,960
 of sample you use to measure is greater than the ring uh than the yeah than the than the range of this

358
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:54,200
 this is the the signal n typically this refer corresponding to the independent

359
00:54:55,160 --> 00:55:02,760
 source signals we are assuming like for example sideways which is what we are we are discussing

360
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:09,720
 so this is a very important concept signal and noise subspace this is what i told you earlier is

361
00:55:10,359 --> 00:55:14,359
 subspace and it's very important so how are we going to

362
00:55:16,759 --> 00:55:24,520
 to look into this okay remember we already know we can do the singular value decomposition of this

363
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:35,160
 ix and then you're based on the singular value you see we we start from the larger one

364
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:44,759
 uh number one is the largest all the way up to np and so this this is the first term

365
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:50,680
 now that there will be the k from np plus one all the way up to n is another one

366
00:55:52,600 --> 00:56:00,920
 so therefore this uk here is the case of the column vector of this also normal for complex

367
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:05,320
 we call it also normal real is also gonna also normal

368
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:18,040
 matrix of this u then it satisfy this you know also normal is if l and m are not the same then

369
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:23,480
 it will become zero this is delta function m you got the l of course you got the one so you'll have

370
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:33,560
 this property and therefore uh this is very useful the two subspace they are mutually orthogonal

371
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:42,040
 you see so that means if this this one from one all the way up to np this is what do i call

372
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:50,520
 signal subspace you have a vector and if you have one vector you'll explain one vector like most

373
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:56,440
 of you are still explaining the one dimension that you can multiply for any no zero value

374
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:02,360
 making infinitely long but a long one vector if you have two you know two vectors as long as they are

375
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:09,800
 also they are even they are assume orthogonal then you'll explain into two d space where it is

376
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:18,760
 playing if you have three three d space and so on so I mean spain mean you'll you'll you'll make the

377
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:25,480
 make the space bigger and bigger and the dimension will be equal to np so this is for the signal

378
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:37,560
 then for noise you use those those uh column vector starting from np plus one as in those

379
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:46,680
 corresponding to this smaller uh single value they'll expand and these two subspace they are also

380
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:58,680
 mutually orthogonal to to each other so this is very important okay and uh let's look at the signal

381
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:06,919
 model so they at least you're linking to our application here assume we are dealing with

382
00:58:06,919 --> 00:58:14,680
 sideways but this is not just deterministic sideways because typically we we can assume

383
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:24,120
 and in some application it does the the phase here they are they're random but uniformly

384
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:31,880
 distribute because phase is two pi t or other so over this minus pi to pi uniformly this

385
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:39,720
 distributed but other parameter aka and the frequency they are they are not random they are

386
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:49,640
 deterministic okay then this these are two ways to write typically we know the in real life our

387
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:57,960
 signal is the real in sign cosine but in the analysis just like you are doing Fourier transform is

388
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:07,560
 easier to introduce uh complex sideways or we call it complex exponential exponential signal

389
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:15,480
 and using error formula you can uh any real sine or cosine real signal you can always like

390
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:26,440
 as a sum of two uh you know complex exponential in conjugate okay so so that's why this is up to

391
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:36,440
 if you're p the np will be twice two p if you're yeah big and and also the relationship this uh

392
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:45,160
 amplitude here is a half uh and the amplitude here is uh is an even function so they are all equal

393
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:52,759
 phase is and it's an all function so you'll change side and so on and uh frequency of course we're

394
00:59:52,759 --> 01:00:01,000
 assuming but looking to negative frequency so you have this uh okay so that means effectively only

395
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:11,319
 the positive one are useful but you can expand into this and then uh this is a typical uh like

396
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:23,960
 simple case and this uh is if you have a sum of two uh side uh complex exponential signal okay

397
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:31,960
 then if the signal is say delayed by one sample delayed by two sample you can uh you see this is

398
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:37,720
 useful property in the time domain you'll delay in your n-dark ways in the frequency domain you'll

399
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:47,640
 you'll become some phase chip and that's precisely here because uh you can see uh all of these two

400
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:56,040
 are related to this s-n s-n is this so we only need to write down this uh basic uh you know the

401
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:04,600
 the signal without without delay and the other you will be uh this one one of course is

402
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,480
 you will be accept then the other one you're every time you have the

403
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:15,319
 shift delay by one you'll get some phase delay delay by two your n-dark ways another one

404
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:22,920
 so this is the one here and then in general from this example you can uh extend it to the general

405
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:30,759
 expression s-n you're you're doing this way this is uh uh you're in total how many you see n-p

406
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:39,800
 uh exponential complex exponential signal here with different frequency and this Q here is the

407
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:48,680
 one you're considering those delay time so now if you want to take the you see we are still looking

408
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:54,040
 at the signal we don't consider noise here i-s equal to this uh uh you take expectation

409
01:01:54,759 --> 01:02:00,600
 uh since this is not random you see it doesn't involve time it doesn't involve the phase you see

410
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:10,759
 so uh so uh this Q you can pull it out and only this part can become like random you have to

411
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,240
 still keep the x-fone name uh expectation here

412
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:23,400
 and then uh i think i finished this part then i take a break uh we can denote this you see again

413
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:32,600
 this is and then the n-case element of this matrix uh you can work out the it will be a product of

414
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:39,240
 this and remember it could be complex then we need to take conjugate and then you'll put the

415
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:47,960
 n-p-dew out first then these are the uh so-called phase term you'll multiply and this is involving

416
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:57,080
 n is the signal itself n is like the timing deck and then if n-eco to k you'll be looking at the

417
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:06,360
 diagonal element then uh of course uh e of this you are just taking the taking this part then

418
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:12,040
 then of course because the other one become become zero uh then you are taking the absolute value

419
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:22,120
 raise the power of two of them uh now for n-eco to k you can taking expectation and then uh you will see

420
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:29,880
 you see those not random you take out those random ones you keep it here okay and

421
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:41,240
 and then according to our formula and also again now if you're depends on whether n equal to k or

422
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:54,919
 not uh you or c here e of this uh it will be uh k equal to k minus uh m equal to p you see it could be

423
01:03:58,279 --> 01:04:05,799
 could be uh equal here we are talking about remember when we explain we will be cross over to the other

424
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:15,160
 half so so therefore this will be equal twice and this is different and not n k minus uh

425
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:22,760
 n not equal to p then they will be independent and either way you can see when you take expectation

426
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:31,000
 uh you you uh it will become zero you can refer back to our early exercises for that so in the end

427
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:39,720
 therefore our is magic will be equal to q then this is a very special diagonal diagonal matrix

428
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:46,360
 and multiply that is and in this way because this is diagonal you can explain into this way so and this

429
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:55,480
 q m uh here is the k column vector of the q you'll divide you'll divide early and then this q

430
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:05,320
 metric is a random matrix and has a ring of minimum and n or np normally we assume n is greater than

431
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:15,720
 np so therefore this is this is matrix is always always singular so yeah therefore you can reduce

432
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:23,400
 this into uh if you add noise this will be the noise and again here this very important important

433
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:33,320
 result this uh the uh signal subspace and the noise there will be there will be orthogonal to uh

434
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:43,080
 also normal to each other if you're dealing with complex and uh yeah so this uh also uh yeah you can

435
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:50,280
 see it derived from this property so it's uh it's the right time to take a break here we have uh several

436
01:05:50,760 --> 01:06:00,120
 uh like uh icon decomposition measure applying to uh spectrum uh power spectrum estimation

437
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:10,120
 we will leave this into next week with uh we will go through that and now is 7 36 uh usually

438
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:20,920
 it's the right time we take a break about just uh 14 10 to 14 minutes so everyone come back to

439
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:30,359
 here uh come back to here before uh 7 4 50 you need to take a break I also want to do

440
01:06:30,359 --> 01:06:37,319
 show you the how we do the do the grouping uh because this time I like all the name here

441
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:46,600
 hope this is clear because uh last time some student uh anyway we are not very clear later you can

442
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:56,440
 you can come up to have to see uh so basically we do the grouping according to your surname

443
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:05,080
 alphabetical order and uh last week for the other call there are many students a bit confused

444
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:12,120
 they have the same surname li and they don't know whether they belong to group one or two so so now

445
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:20,440
 very clear and then there are many one as you also uh you know this time all the one are here

446
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:28,360
 all the lead they're only this lead lead zongda will be the second group and how uh I designate the

447
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:39,160
 the area uh later let me show you here uh typically group one three okay so you look at that group two is

448
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:49,080
 let me see all now the all the chair cutler uh okay uh xin zhang here there's my this this

449
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:56,120
 is an student so you so you see here don't yeah then the I think group one uh group two is a little

450
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:04,680
 bit larger so um maybe I want more role so so make sure yeah so group three will be this uh

451
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:16,680
 lady student from here or after xin zhang even know her uh all the this area will be group two

452
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:23,320
 okay so you take a rest then you take a look at the name yeah I think the name probably not

453
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:31,480
 large enough to see I am a emphasize uh in large the first each group the first name and the same

454
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:41,000
 so so remember here yeah so group one here group three here according to the name basically

455
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:47,399
 your surname is a small letter group one like Chao Chao xin zhang and those are zhang or whatever

456
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:56,520
 will be group three those are in the middle like uh uh Liu Wang will be group uh group two okay

457
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:03,560
 because easier for us to check and to and to collect the uh the paper

458
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,120
 so

459
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:15,000
 I can come to take a look at your young supi I think near the yeah a group three is here yes

460
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:25,800
 oh yeah okay very very good yeah so uh you are very good one and let me see I

461
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:37,880
 I locate each of you you can I think the the other group that uh if she can other than I think

462
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:49,000
 there at the Ha Ha Ha Ha you'll be group one in charge of this uh you'll be in charge of uh

463
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:49,800
 three

464
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,000
 three

465
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:51,479
 shang

466
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,040
 three shang

467
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:09,720
 and you come the other two and you uh let's let's see the other uh okay so maybe I can yeah I can

468
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:17,400
 write down here to make it uh very large so that the other side uh group one uh

469
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:25,320
 group one is from uh I just write down the surname I think it's uh

470
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:39,880
 bang bang all the way until uh most of the li okay li li zhi li then the only

471
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:47,880
 the only li starting with uh li zhong uh

472
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:54,360
 ta you will be group two leading group two after that all the if you're last name is uh

473
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:06,120
 you'll see li plus something or li li and so on uh all the way up to the last one will be one

474
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:16,200
 all the one if you are surname the first letter is smaller than WNG uh like t or whatever it will

475
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:26,519
 be group two then last group three is starting from we surname is wei okay then uh greater than

476
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:35,720
 that one because it will be wu or whatever x xiong yang or all the zheng uh chu whatever

477
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:44,680
 there will be all the way until until the last okay so that one I hope it should be it should be

478
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:53,480
 clear uh to you yeah which one is group one is here group three is out the the other one and group

479
01:11:53,480 --> 01:12:03,959
 two is uh in the middle uh the just now yeah the the the lady standing there is towards n the last

480
01:12:03,959 --> 01:12:10,919
 several row because it's it will be both sides group two is a larger one so it could be uh the

481
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:21,320
 last one so so make sure the ways are the two to student uh uh let me call I have their their phone

482
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:31,400
 uh they are yeah you for them they they gave me the uh let me call them first

483
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:48,680
 you can help to check uh yeah make sure student group eight will be will be sitting this

484
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,520
 group two is at the back the the last

485
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,360
 are you doing are you doing

486
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:32,280
 so today I make you in charge of the group then you will be somehow the last several

487
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:39,080
 from both sides you are you are you are you are you are okay very good in charge of group

488
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:45,719
 three later I gave you a picture just follow me I bring up all the net and then also show the

489
01:13:48,519 --> 01:13:57,480
 so uh again you can yeah contact the paper yeah just make sure they see in the in in right place

490
01:13:57,559 --> 01:14:02,839
 Hannah you're a good one so uh so again here

491
01:14:06,519 --> 01:14:13,959
 okay uh so it should be very clear because we want to make it easier to later to check the

492
01:14:13,959 --> 01:14:22,599
 your uh maturation card and also collect the the paper group one is those surnames are starting

493
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:28,520
 you know alphabetical order with a small one your first letter bang you know the small is one then

494
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:38,040
 all the way up to uh most of the Li Li Ziyi will be group group one is a region one here group three

495
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:47,880
 is here both are later you know Zhang or whatever Yang will be always here so where is the the division

496
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:59,720
 I think yeah it can be can be here okay so so group one is all the way up to here group three is

497
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:09,480
 this side up to here and group two is whatever in the last several rows here can be can be both side

498
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:17,640
 okay you either follow the larger one but not detail all the small one you go you go there to

499
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:25,640
 at the double check okay so I want to make sure everyone follow because easier to easier to check

500
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:32,360
 and easier to collect the paper then I do the yeah I do the marking and then you also sit one next

501
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:39,960
 to the other with a empty seat in the you know between you not to sit next to each other at least

502
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:46,920
 one yeah I think you already know yeah like the the current practice so so make sure because later

503
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:52,200
 if you don't follow later when we check you will be asked to move then it calls you some

504
01:15:53,080 --> 01:16:01,240
 inconvenient uh also yeah okay so Liu is here whether Liu should be the we have the

505
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:12,920
 many students call either Li or Liu or Wang Wang also in group two okay so the this several surnames

506
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:23,560
 many students here I I think here okay so anyone stand up clear if you're not clear you ask

507
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:32,600
 you ask now we still have a few minutes before we start to distribute the paper make sure you'll

508
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:41,240
 follow if you don't are not sure you can tell me your your surname just just name because mostly

509
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:44,440
 we base we based on surname okay

510
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:58,519
 good one here so good one is on my side right hand side up to here yes yes although yeah

511
01:16:58,519 --> 01:17:05,000
 uh not particularly yeah yeah no no no nobody gives you very hard to follow see you you're going

512
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:11,480
 front there are several empty seats yeah normally our class size is nice it's where

513
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:20,520
 where enough every student you'll leave a empty seat yeah yeah typically group two they think double is

514
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:27,160
 some students sitting here only but they should be either going to group one or group three because

515
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:34,200
 group three there's very many empty seats so but the size about the same group two a little bit more

516
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:41,880
 students so okay so should be clear I think Yang is a group three yes yeah so

517
01:17:44,599 --> 01:17:52,200
 any any student not very sure Zhang you're also group three because yeah Zhang is a regular those are there

518
01:17:53,160 --> 01:18:05,080
 uh from we own what w e i and then all the all the way to the end and yeah so so however this is

519
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,400
 very clear okay

520
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:14,200
 all uh more problem

521
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:26,200
 any

522
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:36,200
 more

523
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:56,200
 If any student is wrongly, you are asked to move to the right.

524
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:12,200
 You are also late in your lecture paper.

525
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:40,200
 You are also late in your lecture paper.

526
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:50,200
 You can also go to take a look to see whether they sit properly.

527
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:56,200
 There are still quite many MDCs here.

528
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:04,200
 Also later when we distribute the paper, you can count the number of each row,

529
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:10,200
 then give the correct number, ask them from past from one end to the other.

530
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:14,200
 If they are young, you are more experienced.

531
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,200
 You are taking care of the last two.

532
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:20,200
 Then you can look at the left and right and do one.

533
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,200
 They will be faster.

534
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,200
 The left is fine.

535
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,200
 The right is fine.

536
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,200
 Then you give five papers.

537
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:32,200
 Then you go to the next row.

538
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:36,200
 Let me double check.

539
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,200
 Are you all in correct order?

540
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:48,200
 As I said, if you sit like last week wrongly, then I will ask you to move to the right group, right region.

541
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:52,200
 Where do I sit last time?

542
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:56,200
 Are you in group 2 or 3?

543
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,200
 Group 3.

544
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,200
 Group 2.

545
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,200
 Group 2.

546
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,200
 Yes.

547
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,200
 So very clear.

548
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:10,200
 De Yang, can you come here to help?

549
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,200
 You can just stay here.

550
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:20,200
 So make sure any student beyond this point will be group 2.

551
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,200
 Group 2 is your surname.

552
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,200
 Start from Li Zhong Da.

553
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,200
 That's only Li in group 2.

554
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,200
 All the other Li will be group 1 here.

555
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:32,200
 And all the way up to all the Wang.

556
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,200
 I divide into this way.

557
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:38,200
 So that's why a little bit more student for Wang.

558
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,200
 All the Wang up to group 2.

559
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:44,200
 Then beyond that, WTI will be group 3.

560
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,200
 Sorry, group 2.

561
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,200
 Sorry, group 3 is here.

562
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,200
 Group 2 is here.

563
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,200
 They confuse.

564
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,200
 Group 3 is here.

565
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,200
 Group 3.

566
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,200
 Group 2 in the middle is here.

567
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,200
 It's on both sides.

568
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,200
 Okay?

569
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,200
 So clear.

570
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:08,200
 I think we can start to distribute the paper.

571
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:14,200
 Also, another important rule is very similar to the final exam paper.

572
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:20,200
 You all know, I think for new students, you also is a practice.

573
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:24,200
 In the final exam paper, the last 15 minutes, you cannot leave the hall.

574
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,200
 You cannot submit paper.

575
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:32,200
 So you either submit 15 minutes before the ending time for the exam.

576
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:36,200
 But for this one, since we only one hour, I give you 10 minutes.

577
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:42,200
 So that means if you finish early, probably not many students can do it within 15 minutes.

578
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,200
 There are quite a few sub questions.

579
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:48,200
 So probably majority will take the full Wang out.

580
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:56,200
 But once you're beyond 8.50, you cannot say, I want to submit in the middle.

581
01:22:56,200 --> 01:23:01,200
 You either submit early before 8.50, then you can leave early.

582
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,200
 You want to take the pass or you can leave early.

583
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:11,200
 But once you're after 8.50, the color of your, you have to stay until we collect all the paper.

584
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,200
 Okay? Fair.

585
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:17,200
 So I make this announcement.

586
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:22,200
 And then each student will have a double side quiz paper.

587
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,200
 Let me see with this.

588
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,200
 Okay, so...

589
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,200
 This one.

590
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:44,200
 Okay. I think it's fine.

591
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:51,200
 We already announced that then later, I will try to see whether I can find a similar...

592
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:55,200
 Okay, I think we start to distribute the paper.

593
01:23:55,200 --> 01:24:00,200
 I give you a few more extra minutes.

594
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:11,200
 So next week, in case not enough paper, because I do not have some spare one here.

595
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:18,200
 So you're for...

596
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:23,200
 Group one, you keep this.

597
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:26,200
 Then later, you check you give the paper first.

598
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,200
 And later, yeah.

599
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,200
 So as I say, you give count number.

600
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:33,200
 Okay, then you will be...

601
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:37,200
 The young, you can group two.

602
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:43,200
 So you ask the student or you already know who's there.

603
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:49,200
 It's the same thing you can do later than right after group two.

604
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:53,200
 Then, you'll be the last one.

605
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:58,200
 This way is on the right side here.

606
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:02,200
 This one is later to check their magic.

607
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,200
 But it will be easier.

608
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,200
 No, no, no.

609
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,200
 Six thousand meters.

610
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,200
 They are free seating as long as we do the reason.

611
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,200
 Because it cannot...

612
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,200
 They have to follow.

613
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,200
 As long as they are in the same reason, it's fine.

614
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,200
 So you'll count the row how many.

615
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,200
 Then you'll give the first one.

616
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,200
 Ask them to pass.

617
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,200
 Starting...

618
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,200
 For example, here you have four.

619
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:33,200
 You'll give four paper to the student to pass.

620
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,200
 Then I'll check your name.

621
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

622
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

623
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,200
 Yeah, help them.

624
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,200
 And then the second one, five.

625
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:47,200
 So one student take one paper in case you miss out

626
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,200
 or you have more, you'll give back to me.

627
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,200
 If you don't have, you'll let me know.

628
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,200
 You'll follow the correct...

629
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,200
 What's your name?

630
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,200
 Li.

631
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

632
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,200
 There should be no group one is here.

633
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,200
 Yes, right.

634
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,200
 Anyone who is not clear, let me know.

635
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:19,200
 Those lay comeers, I asked you to come before 7.50.

636
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,200
 But there are always some students coming late.

637
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:25,200
 Lay comeers, you'll let me know.

638
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,200
 Raise your hand.

639
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,200
 Don't sit at the wrong place.

640
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,200
 Then, yeah.

641
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,200
 Okay, okay.

642
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,200
 Are you okay with those?

643
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,200
 Yeah, get the paper.

644
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,200
 You can take a look and write your name.

645
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,200
 Make sure it's clear.

646
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:44,200
 Write the name clearly, because we have some students.

647
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,200
 Not the same name but very close.

648
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,200
 So, yeah.

649
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,200
 Write the name clearly.

650
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,200
 And...

651
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,200
 So...

652
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,200
 You should get enough space.

653
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:05,200
 You answer at the brain page below.

654
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:08,200
 Try to write clearly.

655
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:11,200
 Also, in case you...

656
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:17,200
 make mistake, you can close up or use

657
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,200
 another extra brain paper.

658
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,200
 I bring some brain paper for you.

659
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:26,200
 But most of the students can finish.

660
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,200
 Can do it.

661
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:31,200
 Some questions are very easy, but write carefully.

662
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,200
 Make the...

663
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,200
 Okay, I think you can...

664
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:39,200
 If all done, any...

665
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,200
 You're enough paper to distribute?

666
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,200
 Yeah.

667
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,200
 You also?

668
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,200
 Okay, very good.

669
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,200
 Yeah, extra, okay, very good.

670
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,200
 Keep...

671
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,200
 Bring enough.

672
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,200
 Okay.

673
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,200
 Okay, very good.

674
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,200
 So, you can...

675
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:04,200
 Almost you can start to...

676
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,200
 In case...

677
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,200
 You're not gonna...

678
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,200
 You're not gonna...

679
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,200
 Okay.

680
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:36,200
 Please, take another question on the reverse side.

681
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,200
 It's a double side.

682
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:41,200
 Question one has three sub-questions.

683
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,200
 Each are quite simple.

684
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,200
 Question two, two sub-questions,

685
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,200
 a little bit of calculation.

686
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:51,200
 Let's ask you to bring the calculators.

687
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:03,200
 The pre-season can be...

688
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,200
 Let me see.

689
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,200
 Three digits after the decimal point.

690
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,200
 Yeah.

691
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,200
 Okay.

692
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:16,200
 One of the questions is some numerical calculation.

693
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,200
 Okay.

694
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,200
 Is it one student can relate?

695
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,200
 Or no?

696
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,200
 Okay.

697
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,200
 It's a close book, so...

698
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:44,200
 Okay, nothing I forgot to remind is...

699
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:48,200
 Turn off your mobile phone or at least make it silent.

700
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,200
 Please do so.

701
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:56,200
 If not, then the ring suddenly on.

702
01:29:56,200 --> 01:30:00,200
 It will be some penalty to impose

703
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:04,200
 because it causes trouble to other students.

704
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,200
 Okay.

705
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:10,200
 So, you're all listening to me clearly now.

706
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:14,200
 Turn off your mobile phone or at least make it silent.

707
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,200
 If you are not done so.

708
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,200
 Okay.

709
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,200
 Okay.

710
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,200
 Okay.

711
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,200
 Okay.

733
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,200
 Where we take the—

734
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:42,599
 Okay, now it's 8.30, you still have half an hour to go.

735
01:59:42,599 --> 01:59:47,920
 But if you want to submit and leave, you do it in 20 minutes.

736
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:51,880
 8.50, you can submit one student just submit.

737
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:55,400
 Otherwise, you will remain here.

738
01:59:55,400 --> 02:00:04,679
 You will not leave the LT between 8.50 until your paper is collected by the student assistant.

739
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:08,320
 Okay, in front of you.

740
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:13,040

 Half an hour to go.

743
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:27,320

744
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:31,600
 If you're using two rubble, no need to submit, it's fine.

745
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:32,800
 You will not be marked.

746
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:39,640
 Also for students who are not very sure about the answer, you try to write something.

747
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:45,080
 I will give partial math what you write makes sense.

748
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:51,080
 Okay, the only totally blank will be zero mark for that sub question.

 That's the policy of the exam in general.

751
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:49,880
 If you want to submit and leave early, make sure you pass the paper to one of the student assistants here.

752
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:53,080
 Otherwise, you'll remain seated.
