1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 .

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,280
 .

3
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,860
 We all have higher

4
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,039
 standards for campus persistent

5
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,660
 learning during socially

6
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,620
 law and pardon I did

7
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,660
 the test.

8
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,740
 Normally, machine learning activities include three parts.

9
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,899
 The first part, actually, is data, right?

10
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:38,539
 The data collection.

11
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:42,380
 And the second part is the abstraction.

12
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,900
 So the objective of abstraction is to build a model

13
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,820
 from the given data.

14
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,460
 And then the last component, the component,

15
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,660
 is the generalization.

16
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,539
 Generalization is just to apply, actually, the model length

17
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,820
 in the abstraction step and to the future data.

18
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,740
 So application of the learning algorithm,

19
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,420
 application of the model, which is also

20
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,180
 considered as a part of the machine learning.

21
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,020
 So today, I'll look at the data preparation

22
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,340
 for machine learning.

23
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,740
 Actually, data is very important.

24
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,900
 Actually, in machine learning, there is one thing that

25
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,540
 is garbage in, garbage out.

26
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,900
 So the data is garbage, the rubbish, very bad data, right?

27
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,260
 Why not the data?

28
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,820
 And then the model obtained or learned from this data

29
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,340
 could be very bad.

30
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,620
 Of course, actually, the prediction

31
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,780
 based on the learned model could be bad.

32
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,739
 Bad means the performance is bad, right?

33
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,780
 Then there is low accuracy.

34
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,500
 So this is actually seeing to express

35
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,860
 the importance of data and data quality in machine learning.

36
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:06,180
 So we'll first look at the machine learning activities,

37
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,680
 right?

38
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,180
 OK.

39
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,740
 Actually, I just mentioned machine learning actually

40
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,060
 starts from data collection, right?

41
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,780
 Because this is the first component in the three

42
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,020
 components of the machine learning system.

43
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,660
 So machine learning actually actively starts from data.

44
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,300
 And actually, in the last week, actually, when we taught

45
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,660
 about learning and also, we see there are three basic types

46
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,580
 of learning.

47
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,020
 The first type is called super high-level learning.

48
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,820
 So in super high-level learning, when we collect the data,

49
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,140
 then we also need to label the data.

50
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,860
 So labeling on the data, of course,

51
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,380
 depends on the problem, right?

52
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,380
 So for example, we want to recognize the objects

53
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,700
 in this classroom.

54
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,940
 And then, of course, we can take pictures of all objects

55
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,140
 in this classroom.

56
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,940
 And then we give a name to each picture, give a tag.

57
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,500
 This tag is also called class label.

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,980
 You take a picture of this screen,

59
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,860
 and then you just know, oh, this is a screen.

60
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,860
 You take a picture of this computer,

61
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,300
 then you give a tag or label of a computer.

62
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,220
 So this is called labeling.

63
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,300
 So in super high-level learning, we

64
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,820
 should provide the label training data.

65
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,180
 And another type of learning is called unsupervised learning.

66
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,620
 So if unsupervised learning, we just collect the data,

67
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,340
 and we don't label the data.

68
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,780
 So the data in unsupervised learning is unlabeled.

69
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,740
 And then what the objective of unsupervised learning?

70
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,660
 Actually, we want to discover the patterns

71
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,420
 underlying the data.

72
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,940
 Actually, one important learning task in unsupervised learning

73
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,020
 is the grouping of the data called classroom.

74
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:00,620
 We try to put samples with a great similarity into one group,

75
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,540
 and samples with different similarities

76
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,300
 in another group.

77
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,740
 So this is a classroom or patent discovery.

78
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,660
 Of course, we know that there is a top

79
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,900
 of learning that is a reinforcement learning,

80
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,020
 but that is not covered in this course.

81
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,620
 So this course, we only cover the super high-level learning

82
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,940
 and unsupervised learning.

83
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,340
 For super high-level learning, we collect the data,

84
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,580
 and also we label the data.

85
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,700
 And in unsupervised learning, we just collect the data,

86
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,820
 because there is no need to do the labeling of the data.

87
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,180
 So after we have collected data and also label the data

88
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,780
 for super high-level learning, and then actually,

89
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,740
 we should perform the following activities.

90
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,860
 The first, we to understand the top of the data

91
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,940
 in a given input data set.

92
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,740
 Later, we will see, actually, the data

93
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,580
 can be categorized into different types.

94
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,500
 Some data, like a categorical word,

95
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,580
 where data, like gender.

96
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,660
 So every student in the classroom

97
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,980
 can have a value of male or female.

98
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:18,460
 So for this gender, only two values, two portable values.

99
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,740
 So this kind of variable is called categorical variables.

100
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,580
 And for some variables, these variable

101
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,060
 could be continuous, this feature.

102
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,740
 Attribute could be continuous.

103
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,140
 For example, and your height.

104
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:41,420
 And you could be 1.175 cm, 162 cm.

105
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,060
 So this number can be any number in a certain range.

106
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,780
 So this kind of feature is called a continuous feature.

107
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,140
 So we are looking at this type of feature later.

108
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,020
 And actually, the data type directly

109
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,100
 determines what model or what learning argument we

110
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,660
 should actually adopt.

111
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,500
 So at the beginning, we should actually

112
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,300
 look at the nature of the data, look at the time of the data.

113
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,580
 OK.

114
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,740
 And then we need to explore the quality and some nature

115
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,500
 and also some quality of the data.

116
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,620
 I just mentioned, right, in machine learning,

117
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,580
 and there is a saying, Gaby in, Gaby out.

118
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,660
 So these are data quality, certainly, is very important.

119
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,980
 And if the data is noisy, and then we should take measures

120
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,140
 to address these issues.

121
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,500
 Later, we will see some quality issues include

122
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,659
 like auto liars and some values are extremely high

123
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,140
 or extremely low.

124
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,340
 These probably are noise.

125
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,940
 And some data have missing values, even.

126
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,860
 We don't have a value.

127
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,820
 So this kind of data, these are issues in the data.

128
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,460
 We should now take some measures to address these issues.

129
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,940
 Before, we can use the data or can input the data

130
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,900
 to a machine learning algorithm and to obtain or to learn a model.

131
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,380
 So these are also the activities.

132
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,180
 And also, to the explore relationship

133
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,380
 among the data elements.

134
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,740
 So these data elements normally means actually the attributes.

135
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,300
 So later, we will look at these issue attributes

136
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,620
 or features or variables.

137
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,220
 And actually, when you collect the data,

138
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,380
 you probably not very sure which data or which attribute,

139
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,940
 which variable is important.

140
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,940
 For example, we want to predict a person's salary, right?

141
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,340
 Person's salary after your first job salary, right?

142
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,780
 After the graduation of your MSE.

143
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,780
 So of course, at the beginning, we have no idea

144
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,700
 what are related to the salary.

145
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,700
 Maybe we will actually collect a lot of data, right?

146
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,460
 Your height, your gender, your weight, your GPA,

147
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:11,260
 and your undergraduate GPA or postgraduate GPA.

148
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,580
 You collect a lot of data, right?

149
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,100
 But actually, some of the data may be irrelevant, right?

150
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,300
 So your height, your body weight, your gender,

151
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,940
 is not relevant to your salary.

152
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,740
 But actually, your CGP may be relevant.

153
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,780
 So during this data collection stage,

154
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,580
 we have no idea about this.

155
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,820
 So we can look at the relationship

156
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,540
 between the class label and also each of the attributes

157
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,300
 you have collected.

158
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,140
 If some of them are irrelevant, that

159
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,580
 means that the correlation between the class label

160
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,980
 and, for example, the body weight, your height,

161
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,460
 actually, correlation is very low, right?

162
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,860
 Close to zero.

163
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,340
 This means that this feature is irrelevant.

164
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,660
 And then we should remove this.

165
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:06,860
 And sometimes, the data you collected are quite correlated.

166
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,500
 In other words, when you collect one feature,

167
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,340
 and then another feature will provide very little

168
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,820
 extra information.

169
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,340
 So this kind of feature is redundant.

170
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,900
 So we should also try our best to remove

171
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,540
 the redundancy underlying the data.

172
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,060
 And also, we should remove the significant features

173
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,500
 from the data.

174
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,099
 So these are the, through the exploration

175
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,339
 of the data relationship.

176
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:36,939
 So later, we will see what actually, in techniques,

177
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:40,860
 we can use to explore the relationship between variables.

178
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,819
 Then, actually, now we can try our best to eliminate

179
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:48,339
 these variables.

180
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:52,860
 And so we actually find the potential issues in the data.

181
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,700
 I actually already just mentioned the issue.

182
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,980
 This is a relative quality.

183
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,740
 Some data could have missing values.

184
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,900
 The missing value, that means that this data,

185
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,660
 and for a specific feature or attribute,

186
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,460
 there is no value.

187
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,660
 It's a missing value.

188
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,940
 And some actually could be outliers.

189
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,660
 Maybe during the recording of this data,

190
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,660
 and there are some errors.

191
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,740
 You record down the data wrongly.

192
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,540
 As a person, you use a cm of 175 cm.

193
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,180
 But then later, you write down wrongly,

194
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,939
 like a 75.5.

195
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:36,939
 So this could be an error.

196
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:43,500
 So we could also try our best to actually address this issue.

197
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,780
 And before, we can input the data to the learning algorithm.

198
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,860
 And then, of course, after we have identified the issues,

199
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,060
 the noise, the noise in the data, the correlations,

200
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,500
 and also actually the redundancies,

201
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,060
 and also the insignificant features, for example.

202
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,540
 And then we can actually take some merit to address these issues.

203
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,740
 And then after that, we will perform an preprocessing

204
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,780
 So this preprocessing means actually the scaling.

205
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,300
 So later, we will see this.

206
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,300
 We could perform normalization or standardization of the data,

207
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,660
 and so that the data could be in the same range.

208
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,820
 So here, for example, you record your GPA of 4.4.

209
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,580
 NTU, actually, the system is 5.

210
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,900
 5 is the most, actually, not 4.

211
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,820
 So your GPA is 4.5.

212
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,060
 Then you record down your height.

213
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,500
 It's 170 something, right?

214
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,500
 Your body weight is 60 something, 70 something, KG.

215
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,100
 Actually, the data is in very different range, right?

216
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,420
 So actually, we could have some issues.

217
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,860
 Actually, we have data in very different range.

218
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,300
 So we should perform some preprocessing.

219
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,300
 So later, we will talk about this again, looking into the details.

220
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,020
 Now, how to actually perform this scaling?

221
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,819
 How to perform this scaling so that the features could

222
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:14,300
 be in a similar range.

223
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,180
 And then after the data is obtained,

224
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,260
 then we can start the learning, right?

225
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,819
 So actually, the learning normally, you know the data.

226
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,460
 If you have data, you collect the data, right?

227
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,220
 And you also perform labeling of the data.

228
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,780
 And actually, normally, this data will be divided into two main parts.

229
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,980
 One part is used as a training data.

230
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,939
 Another part is used as testing data.

231
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:42,780
 So in the last week, we have already

232
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,100
 talked about this concept, training data, testing data.

233
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:53,060
 The training data is used to estimate the values

234
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,660
 or the parameter values in the model.

235
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,300
 Normally, in a model, we could have many parameters,

236
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,780
 in particular in deep neural networks.

237
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,140
 We should have a large number of parameters.

238
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,020
 In some large models, the parameters

239
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,939
 could be 100 billion, so big models.

240
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,939
 So we should actually to estimate the parameters.

241
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:22,620
 But actually, normally, the data should be divided

242
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,780
 into two parts, training and testing.

243
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:31,740
 And testing is just actually used to evaluate the quality

244
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,740
 of the model length.

245
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,500
 So these are two parts.

246
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,860
 Quite often, we have one extra part,

247
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,740
 which is called validation data.

248
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,180
 And the validation data normally is

249
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,140
 used to determine the hyperparameters.

250
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,660
 Normally, the hyperparameters actually

251
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,660
 is not length-directed from the data.

252
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,860
 And so we have some parameters that we need to determine.

253
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,460
 So these are the validation data will

254
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,620
 be used to determine the hyperparameters.

255
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,340
 So in such a scenario, the data will

256
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,260
 be divided into three parts, training data,

257
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,860
 and the validation data, and the testing data.

258
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,700
 And normally, 70% of the data will

259
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,780
 be used as a training data.

260
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:25,940
 15% for validation, then the remaining 15% of the data

261
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,820
 will be used for testing.

262
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,380
 Or sometimes, 60% for training, 20% for validation,

263
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,700
 and then the remaining 20% for testing.

264
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,860
 So this is the, of course, actually,

265
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,620
 this is for super part learning.

266
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,980
 For hyperparameters, actually, we don't have label, right?

267
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,220
 And also, we don't divide them into two parts.

268
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,260
 And then we should consider different models

269
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,700
 or learning algorithms for selection.

270
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,020
 And so for each learning task, either super part

271
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,900
 learning or unsupertional, there are many methods.

272
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,140
 There are many methods.

273
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:13,140
 And so actually, in organization,

274
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,700
 there is one theorem, which is called no free lunch theorem.

275
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,980
 No free lunch.

276
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,380
 So what does it mean?

277
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,780
 It means that there are no single algorithm

278
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,020
 that perform the best for all scenarios.

279
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,660
 So these are actually a theorem, actually, of my position.

280
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,860
 I would call it, we know machine learning also

281
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,660
 is a kind of a my position problem.

282
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,420
 So this no free lunch theorem also applicable

283
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,420
 and to machine learning problem.

284
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,460
 In other words, there are no single algorithm.

285
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,020
 There are no single model that perform the best

286
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,380
 for all applications.

287
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,620
 So in your application, we always

288
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,860
 need to try different learning algorithms

289
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,180
 and then look to find the best performing one.

290
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,780
 Of course, when you do the selection,

291
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,540
 and we need to have a good understanding about the data,

292
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,060
 the type of the data.

293
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,620
 And normally, the data you mix contains continuous features

294
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,380
 and then the categorical features or discrete features.

295
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,260
 So we need to think about, in this learning algorithm,

296
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,860
 so in this model, what are the assumptions?

297
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,980
 Whether the data set is set by this assumption.

298
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,220
 If the assumption are not certified in the data set,

299
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,380
 then, of course, actually, probably this model

300
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,500
 or this learning algorithm could produce a performance.

301
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,100
 Sometimes the performance is good,

302
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,180
 but it could not be the optimal results.

303
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,340
 And then that means that we should understand,

304
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,220
 the nature of the data.

305
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,939
 We should also understand the details of the learning

306
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,939
 algorithm and understand the assumptions

307
00:17:57,939 --> 00:18:01,939
 that we have made when we develop this model or this learning

308
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:03,699
 algorithm.

309
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:09,139
 So that is a need to consider different learning

310
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:10,300
 algorithm or models.

311
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,020
 And finally, after we have learned the model,

312
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,340
 and we show that we evaluate the performance,

313
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,660
 this is just like you learn this code.

314
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,220
 Finally, you will actually sit for the exam.

315
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,139
 You will sit the exam in the Latin.

316
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:33,879
 So this is actually the exam where

317
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,379
 tests your learning outcome.

318
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:38,980
 So this is the evaluation.

319
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,340
 And actually, in this course, of course,

320
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,180
 we will cover different learning evaluation procedures.

321
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,020
 And also, we will introduce actually different metrics

322
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,580
 for the performance evaluation.

323
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,780
 So this is a diagram just to summarize the process.

324
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,900
 So we have the input data.

325
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:10,500
 Then in step one, actually, the preparation work

326
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,100
 for the modeling.

327
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,780
 So this is just today's focus, preparation for the data.

328
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,580
 And then after that, actually, we will perform learning.

329
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,580
 The objective of learning is to find the metamethyl model

330
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,180
 and to find the model.

331
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,500
 And then we can apply the model to the testing data

332
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,580
 and to evaluate the performance of this model.

333
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,380
 And sometimes, actually, the performance is not satisfactory.

334
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,540
 For example, in applications, actually,

335
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,900
 we hope the accuracy should be greater than 99%.

336
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,460
 Of course, this is a very ideal scenario.

337
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,460
 Indeed, in some applications, actually,

338
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,940
 this accuracy should be very high.

339
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,660
 For example, you use your fingerprint,

340
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,500
 you use the iris, you use the tree, many biometrics

341
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
 as a password.

342
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,020
 For example, to your bank account.

343
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,180
 So this accuracy must be very high.

344
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,380
 So by some application, actually, maybe the accuracy is low.

345
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,260
 So the model produced, actually,

346
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,740
 anti-satisfactory performance.

347
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,820
 Then we need to think about, OK.

348
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,140
 So maybe the issues could arise from the data

349
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,860
 and could also arise from the model.

350
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,460
 If it's from the data, and then, certainly, actually,

351
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,020
 we should actually take some measures to address these issues.

352
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,140
 For example, there are outliers.

353
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,980
 So outliers, that means some of the data

354
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,460
 has extreme high values or low values.

355
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,660
 So how we should handle this?

356
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,260
 And then we should actually take some measures

357
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,220
 to address all these issues.

358
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:57,100
 And then to get the so-called data,

359
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,020
 then use the refined data to learn another model

360
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,620
 with improved performance.

361
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,620
 And really, linear is not actually just

362
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,940
 actually this is a four-step.

363
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:12,740
 Normally, these four steps are going to be nutritious.

364
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,580
 We need to go through a few rounds

365
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,140
 to produce a model, a good model.

366
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,500
 And sometimes, you probably think,

367
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,100
 we know it just introduced in the last week.

368
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,900
 And there are some platforms, like the company language,

369
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,740
 Python, MacLab, R, or even other company languages,

370
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,860
 or platforms.

371
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,860
 And when the machine learning algorithms actually

372
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:37,939
 are built in the platform, we can

373
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:40,459
 simply call the function and then learn.

374
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:42,899
 Some know, maybe have already had some experience

375
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:44,060
 on machine learning, right?

376
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,659
 You get the data, put the data, call the function,

377
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:48,340
 and then get a result.

378
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,419
 Your learning task is complete in one second.

379
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:52,219
 So fast.

380
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:54,340
 Actually, machine learning is not so simple.

381
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,179
 A project could last one year, right?

382
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:58,260
 Could last one year.

383
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,379
 Actually, one day, one week, one month, even a few months time.

384
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:05,699
 I think you have so many long time, actually,

385
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,820
 to produce a good model.

386
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,060
 OK, so you know the task of just actually

387
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,660
 put the data in the function, then get a model.

388
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,380
 Not so simple, right?

389
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,220
 You need to actually explore the data.

390
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,340
 And you need to explore different learning algorithms.

391
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,820
 And finally, actually, you will find that you want to actually

392
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,180
 shoot your application the most.

393
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,820
 If all the users in machine learning algorithms

394
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,100
 do not shoot your application very well,

395
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,340
 then you should actually develop your own learning

396
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,540
 algorithm or learn your own model.

397
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,980
 And you ought to produce the best performance or optimal

398
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,580
 performance for these specific applications.

399
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,459
 So these are three steps that normally

400
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:51,300
 could go through a few rounds.

401
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,179
 You ought to produce actually an audio performance

402
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:55,620
 for a specific given task.

403
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,860
 So let's look at the basic types of data in machine

404
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,740
 learning.

405
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:13,419
 So a data set is a collection of related information

406
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:14,699
 or records.

407
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:16,459
 So this is a data set.

408
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:21,540
 And the information may be on some entity or some subject.

409
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,899
 So here, maybe we look at one example.

410
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:28,060
 So this is a student data set.

411
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,379
 So it's a collection of records.

412
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:33,500
 So a data set is a collection of records

413
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,460
 which contain related or relevant information.

414
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,860
 So these are student data sets.

415
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,380
 So these data sets records actually

416
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,660
 on the information of many students

417
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,460
 on different entity or subject.

418
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,540
 So we call the rule number, matriculation number,

419
00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:01,260
 and the name, and the agenda, and also to the age.

420
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,540
 So we call all these information.

421
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,740
 This is a student data set.

422
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,540
 So a data set is a collection, not just one sample.

423
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,980
 Not just one.

424
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,340
 We have a lot of records.

425
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,420
 So this is a data set.

426
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,580
 And this is another data set, the student performance data set.

427
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,980
 So we have the rule number, the matriculation number,

428
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,780
 and then the result, the score for math, the score for science,

429
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,980
 and the percentage.

430
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,340
 So this is another data set.

431
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,060
 And in this table, we have a lot of rules.

432
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:54,540
 Normally, the rule normally is that each rule is one sample.

433
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:00,100
 So each rule of a data set is called a sample.

434
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,460
 A sample.

435
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,540
 So a sample.

436
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,540
 So actually, the rule one, actually, the matriculation

437
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,820
 number, and also the math, the science result,

438
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,020
 and also the percentage.

439
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,980
 One rule corresponds to one sample.

440
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,620
 So that means a data set normally

441
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:20,820
 contains a large number of samples, not just one sample.

442
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,780
 One sample, not called a data set.

443
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,180
 It's a collection.

444
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:29,420
 So we must have multiple samples.

445
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:35,980
 And also each data actually has multiple attributes.

446
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,980
 So in this data set, so the rule number,

447
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,100
 so each attribute corresponds to one column in the table.

448
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,900
 In this data set.

449
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,620
 So we have the record number, rule number, and we have the math.

450
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,100
 And we have the science.

451
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,380
 And we have the percentage.

452
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,580
 So these are the four attributes.

453
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,180
 So each rule is one sample.

454
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,340
 And each column is one attribute.

455
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,340
 And this attribute is also called feature or variables.

456
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,260
 I often in statistics, model fitting,

457
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,700
 normally they call variables.

458
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,460
 In machine learning, these are quite often called

459
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,780
 attributes or features.

460
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,140
 So in this example, we have four features,

461
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:37,340
 rule number, the science result, the math result,

462
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,380
 and also the percentage.

463
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,380
 There are four features.

464
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,700
 So how many features in a data set?

465
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,860
 This depends on application.

466
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:58,459
 So in the past, I used to handle some like a Gmkary data.

467
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:03,060
 I read that the minority could be 40,000.

468
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,340
 But the sample could be just a few, like a few hundred.

469
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,860
 But the columns could be 40,000.

470
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,340
 So this is really a dependent application.

471
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,179
 How many features?

472
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:19,620
 And to use, in particular, at the beginning, initially

473
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:25,580
 and how many features you use in the data collection stage.

474
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,500
 So these are not the sample and attribute or features.

475
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,860
 So these are about the data.

476
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,179
 And let's look at the data type.

477
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:40,179
 So data can be broadly divided into two types.

478
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:43,260
 One is the qualitative data.

479
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,699
 Qualitative data.

480
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:47,340
 Another is the quantitative data.

481
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:50,300
 So what is the qualitative data?

482
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,899
 It's about quality.

483
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:57,459
 Qualitative data is about the information of quality.

484
00:27:57,459 --> 00:28:02,260
 And so these quality normally cannot be measured.

485
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,820
 Cannot be measured.

486
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,300
 So these are qualitative data.

487
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,899
 And here, I give some examples.

488
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,340
 For example, about the performance.

489
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:20,260
 And we can use a tree like a good average or per.

490
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,060
 Or very good.

491
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,659
 Excellent.

492
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,260
 All these trees can be used.

493
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,379
 So normally, a tree with a qualitative data, the values

494
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:27,980
 are named values.

495
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,139
 Named values.

496
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:30,740
 Not the numerical value, right?

497
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,820
 Not a number.

498
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,459
 But given, actually, this is called named value.

499
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:37,220
 Named value.

500
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,820
 So good, very good.

501
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,820
 About gender, right?

502
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,379
 Male or female.

503
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:43,580
 So these are named value.

504
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,379
 And talk about the university, right?

505
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:53,620
 So NTU, NUS, or SMU, SUTD in Singapore.

506
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,020
 So these are named values.

507
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,100
 So these named values are qualitative.

508
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,980
 So qualitative data is also called categorical.

509
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,420
 And actually, even a qualitative data, just now

510
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,260
 I mentioned, actually, we give some example.

511
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,460
 Actually, it can be further divided into two types.

512
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,460
 One type is called nominal data.

513
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,540
 Another type is called ordinal.

514
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,100
 There are some differences between the two.

515
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,380
 So what is nominal data?

516
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,820
 So nominal data is one which has no numerical value,

517
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,020
 but named value.

518
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,580
 Just now, very good or good.

519
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,179
 These are all named values, right?

520
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:50,860
 Certainly, these are named values.

521
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,860
 This is one.

522
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,740
 Named value.

523
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:59,740
 So for example, for black group, A group, no, black type,

524
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,220
 black type A, type B, type O, type AB, right?

525
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,740
 So these are named value, nominal.

526
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,060
 And also, call it nationality.

527
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:12,940
 Chinese, Singaporeans, Indian, American.

528
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,940
 So all these are named values.

529
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,419
 So these are nominal data.

530
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:21,300
 And another example, yeah, these are gender, right?

531
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,940
 Male or female.

532
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,379
 So these are important characteristics

533
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:26,980
 for the nominal data.

534
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,540
 So nominal data, for nominal data,

535
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,980
 we cannot perform these mathematical operations

536
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,379
 like addition, subtraction, multiplication.

537
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,020
 And of course, actually, then we cannot have the mean value.

538
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,500
 For example, in this class, actually, many students

539
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,980
 have no black type of A. Some have black type of B.

540
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,740
 Some have type of C. Oh, no, C, sorry.

541
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,940
 Oh, sometimes I have AB, right?

542
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,420
 Then we talk about, is that a value?

543
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,220
 What is the average black type of this classroom?

544
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,980
 What is the standard classroom?

545
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,220
 We don't have these, right?

546
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,180
 We don't have an average black type.

547
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,620
 So this is because, actually, we cannot perform the submissions,

548
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,620
 actually, the addition.

549
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,620
 OK.

550
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,100
 So then we cannot have the mean value.

551
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,500
 Of course, we cannot have the standard of the agents.

552
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
 We cannot have the average.

553
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
 OK.

554
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,500
 So these are characteristics of, actually, the nominal data.

555
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,660
 We cannot perform these kind of operations,

556
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,660
 or environmental operations.

557
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,260
 So the nationality, some Chinese, some American,

558
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:37,340
 some Chinese, some Indians in this classroom, some Singaporeans.

559
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,660
 So what is the average nationality?

560
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,780
 There is no such thing, right?

561
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,300
 No nationality.

562
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,180
 You can see that the average result, right?

563
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,460
 Nearly GPA.

564
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,100
 But we don't have average nationality.

565
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,260
 We don't have this number.

566
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,940
 But we can use others.

567
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,100
 Data will see that we can use the so-called mode, actually,

568
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,500
 for this kind of data.

569
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,659
 But we cannot have the average.

570
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,980
 We cannot have the mean, right?

571
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,580
 OK.

572
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,580
 So these are the nominal data.

573
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:11,899
 OK.

574
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:13,939
 See the nominal data.

575
00:32:13,939 --> 00:32:16,540
 Then another type is called ordinal.

576
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,100
 Ordinal.

577
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:23,899
 And ordinal is also kind of similar to the nominal data.

578
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:26,699
 But actually, the data can be ordered.

579
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:28,540
 The data can be ordered.

580
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,700
 So ordinal data actually also assign name the value

581
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,899
 to attribute, name the value.

582
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:37,300
 But actually, this name the value

583
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,540
 can be actually arranged in a sequence.

584
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,899
 Are they ascending order or descending order?

585
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:47,899
 Increasing or decreasing?

586
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:48,500
 OK.

587
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,220
 So we can also see one value is greater or better

588
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,980
 than another value.

589
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,620
 So this kind of data, actually, they are called

590
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,100
 ordinal.

591
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,979
 OK.

592
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:03,060
 So here are some examples.

593
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,860
 And we talk about the result.

594
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,979
 Happy, unhappy, or very happy, happy, very happy, happy,

595
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:11,500
 unhappy.

596
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:18,219
 Or when we talk about the grid, we talk about get A, you get a B,

597
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:19,379
 or get a C, right?

598
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:21,780
 And we know A is better than B, that's C.

599
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,020
 But B is better than C.

600
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,500
 But there is a sequence.

601
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,139
 Although they are named the value,

602
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,940
 but there could be a sequence.

603
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,180
 One value could be better or greater than another value.

604
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,580
 So this is called ordinal.

605
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,540
 And actually, this is probably similar to numerical values

606
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,820
 to the actual quantitative data.

607
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,420
 And that could be an order.

608
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,420
 OK.

609
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,300
 We have known the height of a person, right?

610
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:52,540
 So later we will see 175, 160, 60.

611
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,420
 And we can have an actually, you know,

612
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,780
 actually arrange this in a sequence of increasing

613
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,420
 or decreasing order.

614
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,379
 So this is actually quantitative data.

615
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:04,340
 A quantitative data.

616
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,379
 So this ordinal, in this aspect, is very similar

617
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,380
 to the quantitative data.

618
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,340
 So hardness of metal, very hard, soft.

619
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,659
 So we can put them into a sequence.

620
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:28,179
 And for this ordinal data, we cannot find the mean.

621
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,100
 But we can find the median.

622
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,699
 Because we can put them into a sequence, right?

623
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,060
 Into a sequence.

624
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,179
 And then actually, we can put the median.

625
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,060
 We can get a median value.

626
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,460
 So what is the value in the middle?

627
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,179
 OK.

628
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,139
 So these are ordinal.

629
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:46,139
 So you can look at these properties, right?

630
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,139
 So these probably are the, you have

631
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,139
 seen these kind of variables.

632
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:52,219
 But probably have never thought about whether we

633
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:56,139
 can perform operations, mathematical operations on them.

634
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:58,859
 So this also, this probably determines

635
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:03,339
 the learning algorithm or the model we should use.

636
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:07,500
 In some models, normally we assume that data are continuous.

637
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,540
 And the quantitative data.

638
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,339
 And then we assume the following normal distribution,

639
00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:15,020
 for example.

640
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,860
 And so if a data is mixed, can't do something like this,

641
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,500
 then we should not actually assume the following normal

642
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,580
 distribution.

643
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,740
 And also we cannot use actually the distance calculations.

644
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,540
 So this is the ordinal.

645
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,740
 And then this is the first time, qualitative data.

646
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,620
 Then that's why it's quantitative data.

647
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:46,460
 Quantitative data actually knows the information

648
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,140
 about quantity.

649
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,700
 And it can be measured.

650
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,500
 It can be measured.

651
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,380
 And quantitative data is also termed a numerical data.

652
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:02,220
 So categorical, not a numerical.

653
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,100
 Categorical, that means actually the data values

654
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,859
 are the categories.

655
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:07,420
 Good, very good.

656
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,940
 As you know, average, right?

657
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,819
 Or per.

658
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,620
 So these are category.

659
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,740
 And the black type, right?

660
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,740
 Category A, category B, category O, category AB.

661
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,100
 So these are categorical.

662
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,020
 And then for the quantitative data,

663
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,100
 they are also called the numerical.

664
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,780
 Numerical, they're called numbers.

665
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,780
 Numbers.

666
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,660
 OK.

667
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,380
 OK, so for these quantitative data,

668
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,980
 and we can further divide them into two types.

669
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,220
 One type is called interval data.

670
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,540
 Another type is called ratio data.

671
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,540
 Interval.

672
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,040
 OK.

673
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,580
 I would actually, of course, data actually, a numerical data.

674
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,660
 An interval data, numerical data, not only the order is known,

675
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,180
 but there is a difference between them.

676
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,700
 It's also known, the difference.

677
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,900
 For example, when we talk about the temperature, right?

678
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,980
 Now it's 25 degrees.

679
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,140
 And then if there is a 10 degree,

680
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,620
 another difference of 15 degrees, right?

681
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,020
 So this 15 degree, you can understand

682
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:23,300
 that this is exactly the meaning of this 15 degrees difference.

683
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,900
 OK.

684
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,380
 So this is an interval data.

685
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,700
 So for interval data, I did not quantitative data.

686
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:38,500
 Normally, this operation, like addition, subtraction,

687
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,580
 are possible, could be conducted or performed.

688
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,020
 And also, actually, the central tendency, the mean.

689
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,299
 Later, we will look at this further.

690
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,500
 Central tendency, or the mean of the data,

691
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,700
 could be calculated.

692
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,140
 Because we can use the summation.

693
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,460
 These are numerical data, actually.

694
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,740
 We can look at the mean, which is the central tendency.

695
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,220
 And also, actually, we can look at the standard divisions,

696
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,859
 the variance.

697
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,419
 So this is actually the interval data, racial data.

698
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:19,459
 Racial data actually represents a numerical data for which

699
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:21,020
 exact value can be measured.

700
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,500
 So they're similar to the interval data.

701
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,779
 And actually, in the interval data, no absolute zero.

702
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,900
 But in the racial data, there is absolute zero.

703
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,660
 So this is the definition of the racial data.

704
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,020
 And also, the data, you can perform addition, subtraction,

705
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,380
 no multiplication or position.

706
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,900
 So central tendency can be calculated.

707
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,620
 And as a tree, in practice, a tree, although no, this data

708
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,500
 can be put into different categories.

709
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,180
 So quite often, we don't try to differentiate

710
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:05,460
 the two types of quantitative data, the numerical data.

711
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,899
 There's a big difference between the two.

712
00:39:07,899 --> 00:39:09,339
 But actually, not much.

713
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:15,859
 So in practice, we normally don't try to differentiate

714
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:18,460
 whether this data is an interval data,

715
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,819
 or whether this data is a racial data.

716
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:23,460
 We just consider them numerical data.

717
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:28,420
 But for the two categorical types of data,

718
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,740
 nominal and ordinal, actually, sometimes

719
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,140
 need to be differentiated.

720
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:42,300
 And for example, actually, in some way,

721
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,700
 we all study a decision tree.

722
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,660
 Sometimes, actually, when the data decision tree is a tree

723
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,300
 structure and a classifier, in one node,

724
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,220
 we need to put the data into two categories,

725
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,380
 into two parts normally, based on a certain rule.

726
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,700
 And if the data is an ordinal, then we

727
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,860
 can use something like, if this feature is greater than some

728
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,340
 value, if the result is greater than good,

729
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,740
 that means even very good, then we can divide them.

730
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:17,020
 Because the ordinal, we can see which value is bigger than

731
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,940
 or greater than some other value.

732
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,100
 If this is nominal, we cannot see using a greater than

733
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,020
 something or less than something.

734
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,580
 But we can use a tree if a value equals something,

735
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,660
 and then we divide them in, then equal, and non-equal,

736
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,260
 divide the data into two sets.

737
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,580
 So we should differentiate the nominal and the ordinal.

738
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,020
 In some classifiers, we should differentiate the two data.

739
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:46,540
 But for the numerical data, whether the quality

740
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,020
 is an interval or a ratio, normally we

741
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,340
 don't try to differentiate the two types of data.

742
00:40:55,779 --> 00:41:00,340
 So this diagram shows, just shows the categorization

743
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,300
 of the data.

744
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,340
 So attributes, then we have a qualitative data,

745
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,540
 or categorical data, then we have a quantitative data,

746
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,140
 or numerical data.

747
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,820
 So for each of them, we can divide them

748
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,020
 into two types, nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio.

749
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,740
 So we need to understand the nature of the data,

750
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,220
 the type of the data.

751
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,780
 And this actually, I just mentioned,

752
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,020
 if you know the type, whether it's ordinal,

753
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,300
 and then if ordinal, we can use a greater than something,

754
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,060
 it's a value.

755
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,740
 And what is greater?

756
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,780
 Actually, in the computer, part of it,

757
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,620
 this is actually very good or bad.

758
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,980
 Part of it is denoted by numerical value.

759
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:50,180
 For example, good, good, now we start from the bad,

760
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:54,420
 very good, for example, is a four.

761
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,299
 And then good is a three.

762
00:41:56,299 --> 00:42:00,460
 And then actually, the average is two.

763
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,700
 And then per is one.

764
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,460
 So sometimes we can use a greater than something, right?

765
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,900
 If this actually, like a performance,

766
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,299
 is greater than two.

767
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,620
 Because this is an ordinal, we can use this.

768
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,100
 So if this is nominal, then we can only

769
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,580
 use whether this value is equal to this.

770
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,020
 Blood type, we cannot see that our blood type is greater

771
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,900
 than something.

772
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,300
 We cannot see that.

773
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:23,800
 OK.

774
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:36,100
 And so this is another kind of categorization for the data.

775
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,800
 So in this data, they simply consider

776
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,520
 discrete or continuous.

777
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,360
 The data, whether this data, this feature or this data

778
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,000
 is discrete or this data is continuous.

779
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,280
 So we use this actually.

780
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,880
 The data is simply put in these two groups, two categories.

781
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,800
 For the discrete, discrete, that

782
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,360
 means actually that this feature or this attribute,

783
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,400
 we have limited possible values.

784
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,200
 Just now we use the gender, right?

785
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,400
 The gender.

786
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,920
 Male, female, just two possible values, right?

787
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,680
 The blood types, AB, ABO.

788
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,400
 Only four types.

789
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,120
 So these possible values are very limited.

790
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,240
 Two and four, right?

791
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:31,160
 Just now in the result, good average per three categories,

792
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,080
 three possible results.

793
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,200
 So this kind of data actually is discrete.

794
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,640
 So we have finite.

795
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:47,640
 So actually, countably infinite.

796
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,120
 They mean this number could be very large, huge.

797
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,279
 But there is a correspondence with a natural number.

798
00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:55,720
 Although this number is big, right?

799
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,720
 Then this one, actually this number could correspond to a one.

800
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,080
 This number could correspond to one billion.

801
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,720
 Actually, that is a one to one correspondence

802
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
 with a natural number.

803
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,160
 Although this number is huge, so it is still considered

804
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,400
 as a discrete.

805
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
 So quite often we think about the discrete.

806
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,799
 We think about the unlimited value, right?

807
00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:19,279
 Limited.

808
00:44:19,279 --> 00:44:21,799
 But this value could be huge.

809
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:24,400
 Countable infinite.

810
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,240
 So that means actually, as long as there

811
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,480
 is a one to one correspondence with a natural number,

812
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,560
 a natural number could be a very big number, right?

813
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,560
 So as long as there is such a correspondence,

814
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:43,320
 then actually it will be considered as a discrete data.

815
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,400
 And so nominal data, certainly, nominal, right?

816
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,600
 Nominal, all actually, the, you know, it's a, OK.

817
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,880
 If this is actually discrete, actually, only two values

818
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,320
 are male or female, right?

819
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,320
 So or fail or pass.

820
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,760
 So this kind of value, they call binary attributes.

821
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,480
 So these are special kind of discrete attributes,

822
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,600
 only two possible values.

823
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,640
 OK, so the next actually is a continuous.

824
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,360
 Continuous attributes can take many values, right?

825
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,840
 Can take actually any possible values in a range.

826
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,280
 And actually, so just actually your body weight, right?

827
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,400
 This is all temperature of the room.

828
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,640
 You can measure the temperature, right?

829
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:42,320
 And 25 or 0.5, maybe at the beginning, later change to 26.5.

830
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,360
 And later change to 26.3.

831
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,400
 So any possible values.

832
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,560
 OK, yeah, set a range, right?

833
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,320
 So this is continuous.

834
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,680
 Continuous.

835
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,520
 OK, so sometimes actually you differentiate, actually,

836
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,920
 you know, nominal, internal or racial.

837
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,200
 But sometimes you simply put this into two categories.

838
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,160
 A discrete and continuous.

839
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,660
 OK.

840
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,160
 So in general, nominal and the ordinal attributes

841
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,200
 are discrete, right?

842
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,160
 Because they just have a limiting value.

843
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,080
 They are categorical, right?

844
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,800
 Categorical.

845
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,300
 OK.

846
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:32,440
 And it will reach out to the quantum data.

847
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,080
 So they are continuous.

848
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,160
 Or they are also numerical data.

849
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,240
 So these are just the data types, right?

850
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,400
 The data types.

851
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,640
 And so next actually we look at the exploration

852
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,920
 of the structure of the data.

853
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,720
 OK.

854
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,760
 So when you give a data, right, when I give a data,

855
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,520
 so when you collect the data, actually, quite often,

856
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,320
 actually, you may get the data, for example,

857
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,880
 from the website, right?

858
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,320
 And actually, quite often, actually, the data

859
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,040
 is also attached with the so-called data dictionary.

860
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,120
 Dictionary.

861
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,800
 OK.

862
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,040
 And actually, this data dictionary, actually,

863
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,320
 just then, actually, presents the information

864
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,280
 of this data set, the information.

865
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,000
 In particular, the information about the features,

866
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,880
 the attributes, the types of attributes.

867
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,800
 OK.

868
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,040
 So these are the data dictionary.

869
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,560
 But if you collect data, right?

870
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,800
 You collect data.

871
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,040
 And then you also want to keep the data for others

872
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,320
 to use in the future.

873
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,800
 So probably you also need to actually now

874
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,320
 make such a data dictionary, actually,

875
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,720
 to a certain data set.

876
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,000
 So data dictionary actually introduce or express

877
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,560
 the information about the data set,

878
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:05,640
 in particular, about the property or nature of the features,

879
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,600
 including the name of the feature, the type of the feature.

880
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,580
 OK.

881
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,040
 The detailed information of each of the attributes.

882
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,540
 OK.

883
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:20,080
 So these are data dictionary and the data type.

884
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,520
 Some relevant details.

885
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,560
 Actually, sometimes you just give a feature, right?

886
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,839
 You must give the data.

887
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:26,680
 Sometimes, actually, you introduce

888
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,200
 how this feature is obtained.

889
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,920
 And remember, there is some data set.

890
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,440
 OK.

891
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,120
 So the data set, actually, it is not very raw data.

892
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,000
 This data actually derived from the image.

893
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,560
 OK.

894
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:46,440
 So this feature is the top out of which property

895
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,160
 is extracted from the image feature.

896
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,080
 A image.

897
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,720
 OK.

898
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,880
 And this feature, second feature,

899
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,400
 is what feature, which property of the image.

900
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,720
 They introduce this.

901
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,440
 Also give the name.

902
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,839
 This feature is about the blood pressure of the patient.

903
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,000
 And this is no feature.

904
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,440
 It's about the temperature, body temperature of this patient.

905
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,440
 OK.

906
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,920
 They not only just give the value, right?

907
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,480
 In this dictionary, they also talk about,

908
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,360
 oh, this feature is the name of the feature.

909
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,120
 How this feature actually obtained.

910
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,620
 OK.

911
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,600
 Extra information about the feature.

912
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,200
 OK.

913
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,320
 So of course, actually, sometimes maybe, actually,

914
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,600
 the data dictionary is not actually available.

915
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:37,040
 And then we should use some functions in the toolbox

916
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,480
 to discover the top of the features, the nature of the features.

917
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,160
 OK.

918
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,839
 So these are the dictionaries.

919
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,200
 So here, actually, I just show one data dictionary.

920
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,080
 Actually, if you study machine learning,

921
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,880
 I think best actually, we should know machine learning

922
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,920
 data repository.

923
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,200
 This is UCI, University of California, at Avering.

924
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,640
 So UCI, machine learning data repository.

925
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,560
 So this is a repository.

926
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,040
 And there are a lot of data set.

927
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,720
 For each data set, for example, for the auto and the car,

928
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,520
 auto, the MPG data set.

929
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,800
 And they give this information, right?

930
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,440
 The number of samples, the feature types, right?

931
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,480
 And whether there are missing values.

932
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,360
 So here, then, for the variables,

933
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,280
 as we talked about, the variable name, like a displacement.

934
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,520
 And then, so the type of the data are continuous.

935
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:44,760
 And the cylinder and the integer types,

936
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,560
 whether there are missing values or not,

937
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,320
 they all give this kind of information.

938
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,560
 So this is a data dictionary.

939
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,920
 And it's very useful for us to understand

940
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,080
 the nature of the data, the data types.

941
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,040
 At the beginning, I see the data type is important.

942
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:04,880
 And when we actually look for or select or choose suitable,

943
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,040
 learning or learning or suitable models,

944
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,600
 actually, we need to have a good answer about the data type

945
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,000
 and also have a good answer about the model.

946
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,280
 So this model, whether it can be applied to nominal data

947
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,320
 or ordinal data.

948
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,440
 So we should have this understanding.

949
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,920
 So we have to get the information

950
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,640
 about the type of the feature.

951
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:32,840
 Actually, we can get it from the data dictionary.

952
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,640
 I just mentioned, if not available,

953
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,120
 then we maybe need to use some software to discover.

954
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:44,280
 Actually, then we can even plot the data

955
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,840
 to decide whether this data is continuous or discrete.

956
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:55,400
 If we know the nature, this should perform very good.

957
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,080
 And then, all we know, this is ordinal.

958
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:04,680
 So through this exploration, we can understand the data.

959
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:10,720
 So now, actually, we have a 10-inch brick.

960
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,240
 After brick, then we will look further

961
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,200
 into the exploration of the data structure.

962
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

963
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

964
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

965
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

966
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

967
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

968
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

969
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

970
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

971
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

972
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

973
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

974
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

975
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

976
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

977
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

978
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

979
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

980
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

981
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

982
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

983
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

984
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

985
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,840
 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

986
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,840

 So we can see that we have a lot of data.

1242
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,840
 So here I copy part of the

1243
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,840
 part of the

1244
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,840
 part of the MPG data set

1245
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,840
 to show this.

1246
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,840
 And this data set has a few features.

1247
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,840
 And the MPG

1248
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,840
 cylinder

1249
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,840
 displacement, horsepower, weight.

1250
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,840
 And all the

1251
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,840
 acceleration, model year

1252
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,840
 origin.

1253
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,840
 So this is actually

1254
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,840
 all actually

1255
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,840
 features.

1256
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,840
 This is a feature.

1257
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,840
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1258
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,840
 And then the last one

1259
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,840
 is the car name.

1260
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,840
 And actually here

1261
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,840
 actually some of the variables

1262
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,840
 are already given all the numerical, right?

1263
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,840
 Origin.

1264
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,840
 And actually this origin is normally

1265
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,840
 this actually like categorical variables.

1266
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,840
 Although they are numerical

1267
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,840
 here they are not named value, right?

1268
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,840
 But they are categorical.

1269
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,840
 So because for the

1270
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,840
 origin, origin

1271
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,840
 which is the origin of the car.

1272
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,840
 One is USA,

1273
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,840
 two is Japan

1274
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,840
 and then number three maybe

1275
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,840
 Germany.

1276
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,840
 So this is the origin of the cars.

1277
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,840
 So just a limited value, right?

1278
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,840
 And also the car name

1279
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,840
 also limited.

1280
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,840
 These are the nominal values, right?

1281
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,840
 Nominal. You cannot see

1282
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,840
 one country is bigger than another, right?

1283
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,840
 Now the value is bigger than another one, right?

1284
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,840
 So like origin

1285
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,840
 and also the car name.

1286
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,840
 So these are the

1287
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,840
 nominal data, right?

1288
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,840
 So categorical.

1289
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,840
 Nominal.

1290
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,840
 But for some of the variables

1291
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,840
 actually you can see

1292
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,840
 like

1293
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,840
 cylinder, right?

1294
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,840
 Cylinder actually is

1295
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,840
 here they just show like

1296
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,840
 four, six, eight.

1297
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,840
 And actually this shows one is bigger

1298
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,840
 cylinder actually is categorical

1299
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,840
 but it is ordinal.

1300
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,840
 Okay. It's ordinal.

1301
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,840
 Okay.

1302
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,840
 And then we have some other like

1303
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,840
 horsepower and also the displacement.

1304
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,840
 So these are the continuous.

1305
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,840
 These are the

1306
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,840
 quantitative data

1307
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,840
 or numerical data.

1308
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,840
 Okay. Or continuous.

1309
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,840
 So some of them are discrete.

1310
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,840
 Some of them actually

1311
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,840
 are continuous, right?

1312
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,840
 So for the discrete

1313
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,840
 some of them actually are

1314
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,840
 nominal and some of them

1315
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,840
 are ordinal.

1316
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,840
 Okay. I just said you already analyzed, right?

1317
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,840
 Origin means the country.

1318
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,840
 So although each country here

1319
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,840
 denoted by one numerical value

1320
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,840
 but it is still numerical.

1321
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,840
 So this is categorical.

1322
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,840
 Actually this actually is

1323
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,840
 nominal. The car name here

1324
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,840
 they are given the name, the name of the value, right?

1325
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,840
 But actually

1326
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,840
 this is a nominal.

1327
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,840
 We cannot see

1328
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,840
 one name is bigger than another name.

1329
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,840
 Normally we don't see this.

1330
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,840
 So this is a nominal.

1331
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,840
 Okay. So this data

1332
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,840
 normally is called mixed.

1333
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,840
 Mixed. Okay.

1334
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,840
 If a data set contains actually

1335
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,840
 more than one type of data

1336
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,840
 then this data is set

1337
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,840
 is called mixed data.

1338
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,840
 And quite often we know

1339
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,840
 the data is mixed.

1340
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,840
 Okay. We have different types

1341
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,840
 of data.

1342
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,840
 And for the

1343
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,840
 nominal data actually

1344
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,840
 although it is denoted

1345
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,840
 by the number here, right?

1346
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,840
 And actually

1347
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,840
 I think this point, I think I want to emphasize

1348
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,840
 I talked about this a few times actually

1349
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,840
 I want to emphasize this.

1350
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,840
 Although here they are given numerical values

1351
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,840
 but normally we cannot see one value

1352
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,840
 greater than another value.

1353
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,840
 We cannot see that.

1354
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,840
 They are denoted by different numbers.

1355
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,840
 These different numbers

1356
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,840
 only show they are different.

1357
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,840
 This country, two,

1358
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,840
 is different from another country, one.

1359
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,840
 Different from country three.

1360
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,840
 So this value only shows the difference.

1361
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,840
 We don't have a sense

1362
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,840
 that one value is greater than another value.

1363
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,840
 Okay. So I think

1364
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,840
 these are very important property.

1365
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,840
 And actually so

1366
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,840
 we have a model. Sometimes

1367
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,840
 we need to analyze this nature

1368
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,840
 and then we decide actually

1369
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,840
 what kind of model we should use

1370
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,840
 actually

1371
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,840
 in the learning.

1372
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,840
 Okay.

1373
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,840
 So these are some analysis, right?

1374
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,840
 Okay. Real numbers.

1375
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,840
 Okay.

1376
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,840
 And actually the cylinder here

1377
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,840
 and the origin has

1378
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,840
 numerical values actually.

1379
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,840
 Although they are numerical,

1380
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,840
 they are denoted by numerical value.

1381
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,840
 But actually in practice

1382
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,840
 we should consider them actually

1383
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,840
 as categorical.

1384
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,840
 Okay.

1385
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,840
 Okay.

1386
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,840
 So that's actually we explore the numerical data.

1387
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,840
 Now we know that data can be

1388
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,840
 categorical

1389
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,840
 or numerical, right?

1390
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,840
 So that's actually you first look

1391
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,840
 at all the numerical data.

1392
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,840
 And the first

1393
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,840
 exploration is to understand

1394
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,840
 the central tendency.

1395
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,840
 The central tendency.

1396
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,840
 Okay.

1397
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,840
 I think the central tendency,

1398
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,840
 how to measure this central tendency.

1399
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,840
 I think the most commonly used

1400
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,840
 measure is just the mean.

1401
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,840
 Okay. Mean actually the most

1402
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,840
 frequently used metric

1403
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,840
 and for the

1404
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,840
 central tendency.

1405
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,840
 Okay.

1406
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,840
 So the mean value, the mean.

1407
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,840
 What is the mean? Mean is just the average, right?

1408
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,840
 In statistics, so this is called

1409
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,840
 expectation.

1410
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,840
 Okay.

1411
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,840
 So what is expectation?

1412
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,840
 Okay.

1413
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,840
 So it depends how to calculate expectation, right?

1414
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,840
 And we have formula to calculate.

1415
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,840
 But actually, you know, this is actually

1416
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,840
 I think the mean

1417
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,840
 expectation

1418
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,840
 of the mean is just the average.

1419
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,840
 Right?

1420
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,840
 So here we can put the summation first

1421
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,840
 and then divide it by the number,

1422
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,840
 number of numbers.

1423
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,840
 Then actually just get the average.

1424
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,840
 So from here, you know, for the mean,

1425
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,840
 we first get the summation addition, right?

1426
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,840
 So addition.

1427
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,840
 So certainly, you know, this addition

1428
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,840
 should not be performed actually

1429
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,840
 on the

1430
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,840
 categorical data, right?

1431
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,840
 We cannot actually get the average.

1432
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,840
 Because we cannot get the summation, right?

1433
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,840
 So we don't have the mean

1434
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,840
 for categorical variables.

1435
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,840
 Okay.

1436
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,840
 So this is for continuous, right?

1437
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,840
 For numerical values, number four continuous.

1438
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,840
 For quantitative data.

1439
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,840
 Quantitative, the continuous

1440
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,840
 is the numerical, right?

1441
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,840
 So for numerical data,

1442
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,840
 we can calculate the mean.

1443
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,840
 So mean is the most frequently used

1444
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,840
 measure for the

1445
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,840
 central tendency of the data.

1446
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,840
 Okay.

1447
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,840
 Then another measure is called median.

1448
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,840
 Median value, right?

1449
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,840
 So normally, I render data

1450
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,840
 in a sequence.

1451
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,840
 Increasing order or decreasing order.

1452
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,840
 Then the median

1453
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,840
 is just the value

1454
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,840
 in the middle, right?

1455
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,840
 So here we have five numbers.

1456
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,840
 And we render data

1457
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,840
 in increasing order.

1458
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,840
 Then the 67,

1459
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,840
 actually it's in the middle number, right?

1460
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,840
 So the 67 is just the median.

1461
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,840
 Okay.

1462
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,840
 So these are the

1463
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,840
 median.

1464
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,840
 And so mean is

1465
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,840
 impacted

1466
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,840
 if too many data elements

1467
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,840
 having values

1468
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,840
 close to the far end of the range.

1469
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,840
 In other words, actually even in a data set,

1470
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,840
 there are many extreme

1471
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,840
 values.

1472
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,840
 Many extreme values.

1473
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,840
 Okay.

1474
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,840
 So there are a few extreme values.

1475
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,840
 Extreme high values

1476
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,840
 or extreme low values.

1477
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,840
 So these extreme low or extreme high values

1478
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,840
 could be caused by

1479
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,840
 error.

1480
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,840
 So you will use

1481
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,840
 limited

1482
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,840
 average to find the mean, right?

1483
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,840
 So certainly, these are not small

1484
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,840
 numbers. Not many number of big

1485
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,840
 values, small values.

1486
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,840
 Certainly we will have a big impact

1487
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,840
 on this mean value, right?

1488
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,840
 So mean value is

1489
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,840
 easier to be affected

1490
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,840
 by noisy data.

1491
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,840
 The mean value.

1492
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,840
 Okay.

1493
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,840
 In particular, if the data has some outliers,

1494
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,840
 right?

1495
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,840
 We want to cover the average

1496
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,840
 wealth

1497
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,840
 of the people in this classroom

1498
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,840
 together with Ma Yun

1499
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,840
 and Bill Gates, right?

1500
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,840
 So they are increased.

1501
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,840
 Actually, certainly this is not

1502
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,840
 a good measure for the central tendency

1503
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,840
 of the wealth of the people

1504
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,840
 in this classroom, right?

1505
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,840
 Because they are outliers.

1506
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,840
 Okay.

1507
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,840
 So in such a scenario,

1508
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,840
 we should use actually

1509
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,840
 the median value, right?

1510
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,840
 You arrange them, right?

1511
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,840
 Arrange all the wealth

1512
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,840
 of every people in this classroom

1513
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,840
 together with Ma Yun

1514
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,840
 and Bill Gates. You still find that

1515
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,840
 actually this median value

1516
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,840
 is less affected

1517
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,840
 by those extreme values

1518
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,840
 outliers.

1519
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,840
 Okay. So this is actually

1520
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,840
 the median, right?

1521
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,840
 And actually in practice,

1522
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,840
 actually, across all the actually

1523
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,840
 we compare

1524
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,840
 the difference between the median value

1525
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,840
 and the mean values.

1526
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,840
 So normally, the median values

1527
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,840
 and the mean values should be close to each other.

1528
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,840
 Although they are not the same value, right?

1529
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,840
 Actually, but normally

1530
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,840
 there is not a big difference between the two.

1531
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,840
 Okay.

1532
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,840
 So we should use plot of the deviation between the two.

1533
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,840
 If the deviation between the two,

1534
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,840
 the difference between the two is big.

1535
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,840
 And then actually we can

1536
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,840
 look further into the data.

1537
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,840
 Okay. For example, right?

1538
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,840
 And if there is

1539
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,840
 a big difference between the mean

1540
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,840
 and the median.

1541
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,840
 So most likely, there are some outliers

1542
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,840
 in the data.

1543
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,840
 There are some extreme high values

1544
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,840
 so both type of values, right?

1545
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,840
 Will affect the mean value.

1546
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,840
 Okay.

1547
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,840
 So you can observe the difference between

1548
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,840
 the median and the mean, right?

1549
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,840
 From here, we can actually, you know,

1550
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,840
 deduce probably

1551
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,840
 the data contains some outliers.

1552
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,840
 Okay.

1553
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,840
 Then we should try to find

1554
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,840
 these outliers and then take some measures

1555
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,840
 actually to impute these outliers.

1556
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,840
 Okay.

1557
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,840
 So this is the

1558
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,840
 exploration, right?

1559
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,840
 Look at the tendency,

1560
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,840
 look at the mean, look at that.

1561
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,840
 Then we can look at the median.

1562
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,840
 Then we can some, can discover

1563
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,840
 some potential issues underlying the data.

1564
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,840
 Okay.

1565
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,840
 Another

1566
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,840
 commonly used tree, Merian,

1567
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,840
 is called Mood.

1568
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,840
 Mood is

1569
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,840
 more frequently used tree, you know,

1570
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,840
 for others, right?

1571
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,840
 For the nominal

1572
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,840
 or for the

1573
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,840
 ordinal.

1574
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,840
 So

1575
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,840
 we cannot get the summation, right?

1576
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,840
 We cannot get the summation.

1577
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,840
 We cannot get the average.

1578
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,840
 Certainly we cannot take the mean, right?

1579
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,840
 We cannot take the mean.

1580
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,840
 But actually we can take the median.

1581
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,840
 And also a tree, we can take the so-called

1582
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,840
 Mood.

1583
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,840
 Mood actually is the most frequent

1584
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,840
 value

1585
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,840
 of the tree.

1586
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,840
 For example, in the class, right?

1587
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,840
 Actually we can test

1588
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,840
 the blood type of each student.

1589
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,840
 Okay.

1590
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,840
 And we have blood type A,

1591
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,840
 we have blood type B, AB, and O, right?

1592
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,840
 Actually, of course, we know

1593
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,840
 probably, and the result is that

1594
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,840
 actually we cannot take the average.

1595
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,840
 We see every blood type

1596
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,840
 of the students' classroom.

1597
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,840
 We cannot have these values.

1598
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,840
 But we can see the most frequent, right?

1599
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,840
 Actually the blood B

1600
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,840
 has the largest number,

1601
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,840
 largest proportion. Okay.

1602
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,840
 So the Mood.

1603
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,840
 The Mood, right?

1604
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,840
 Actually it is the most frequent number.

1605
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,840
 Most frequent number here.

1606
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,840
 We can take this as

1607
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,840
 a central tendency

1608
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,840
 for actually

1609
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,840
 for the categorical values.

1610
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,840
 Of course, for continuity

1611
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,840
 we can still look at that, right?

1612
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,840
 But for continuous, and probably

1613
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,840
 mean, and the median actually are better

1614
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,840
 measures for the central tendencies.

1615
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,840
 Okay.

1616
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,840
 So this is the three measures,

1617
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,840
 mean, media, mean,

1618
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,840
 and the mood for the central tendency.

1619
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,840
 Okay.

1620
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,840
 And this diagram shows us

1621
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,840
 the mean

1622
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,840
 value and also the median

1623
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,840
 value for all the features,

1624
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,840
 right?

1625
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,840
 And as you can see, also

1626
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,840
 we can find the deviation,

1627
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,840
 the difference.

1628
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,840
 And for the MPG,

1629
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,840
 the difference is only 2.17%.

1630
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,840
 So this is

1631
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,840
 a low number, right?

1632
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,840
 This is actually a difference in low.

1633
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,840
 But for some values, right?

1634
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,840
 For some features

1635
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,840
 or attributes, like displacement,

1636
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,840
 the

1637
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,840
 median is 148.5

1638
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,840
 and the mean value

1639
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,840
 is now 9.4.

1640
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,840
 So there is a very big difference.

1641
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,840
 Actually the difference is 23.22%.

1642
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,840
 So this is very high.

1643
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,840
 Okay.

1644
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,840
 So by looking at this summary

1645
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,840
 of the

1646
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,840
 mean and the media, then we check the difference.

1647
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,840
 And then we can

1648
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,840
 know actually which feature

1649
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,840
 has a high

1650
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,840
 difference between the mean

1651
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,840
 and the media, right? Then we can

1652
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,840
 look further into the data

1653
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,840
 and see whether there are some issues

1654
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,840
 in the data

1655
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,840
 for that particular attributes.

1656
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,840
 And also in this table

1657
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,840
 we show the horsepower.

1658
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,840
 There is no value for the

1659
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,840
 median. There is no value for the mean.

1660
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,840
 Okay.

1661
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,840
 Certainly actually,

1662
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,840
 we have a run program,

1663
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,840
 the other program cannot calculate,

1664
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,840
 is able to calculate the mean

1665
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,840
 value and the median value.

1666
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,840
 Okay. Then we should look further, right?

1667
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,840
 Look into the data

1668
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,840
 to check. So what are the issues?

1669
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,840
 And then we should try our best

1670
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,840
 to address these issues.

1671
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,840
 Okay.

1672
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,840
 So for this entry, we can note a tree

1673
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,840
 like

1674
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,840
 why we have this entry, no question mark

1675
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,840
 there, right? So this is because

1676
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,840
 we look further into the data

1677
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,840
 and we find a tree

1678
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,840
 for the horsepower.

1679
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,840
 There are six

1680
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,840
 samples.

1681
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,840
 Horse power

1682
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,840
 have no values.

1683
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,840
 So six samples

1684
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,840
 have no value for the horsepower

1685
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,840
 for this attribute.

1686
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,840
 So if no value

1687
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,840
 actually this is the so-called

1688
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,840
 mission value problem.

1689
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,840
 Mission value. So later we will

1690
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,840
 actually talk about this further.

1691
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,840
 So if there are mission values

1692
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,840
 in the future, so

1693
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,840
 how we should address this

1694
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,840
 issue?

1695
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,840
 Mission values, right?

1696
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,840
 If there are mission values, normally

1697
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,840
 no question mark, right?

1698
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,840
 Or just empty, right?

1699
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,840
 For that element,

1700
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,840
 in a matrix, right?

1701
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,840
 Then actually

1702
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,840
 the program has no problem

1703
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,840
 to calculate the mean.

1704
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,840
 That's the reason why we see the question mark there.

1705
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,840
 Okay.

1706
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,840
 So, but just now do a bit of exploration, right?

1707
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,840
 Actually we have

1708
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,840
 a lot of data understanding

1709
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,840
 about the data, right?

1710
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,840
 Look at the data dictionary

1711
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,840
 and then we can understand the data types, right?

1712
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,840
 Nominal, ordinal

1713
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,840
 all actually we see the numerical, right?

1714
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,840
 Or we see the continuous.

1715
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,840
 We can look at this, right?

1716
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,840
 And by looking at the mean, the central tendency

1717
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,840
 look at the difference

1718
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,840
 between the mean and the median, right?

1719
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,840
 And we can have further understanding

1720
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,840
 about the data.

1721
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,840
 So potentially

1722
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,840
 one potential issue, right?

1723
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,840
 Like, you know, all the layers

1724
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,840
 in the data.

1725
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,840
 And also in this example

1726
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,840
 show that we probably

1727
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,840
 the data could have the mission value problem.

1728
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,840
 Then for some features

1729
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,840
 we don't have actually the mean.

1730
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,840
 We don't have the median, right?

1731
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,840
 This is because actually the program

1732
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,840
 that could cannot actually calculate this value

1733
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,840
 because of the mission values

1734
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,840
 in this feature.

1735
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,840
 Okay?

1736
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,840
 So this is a solution, right?

1737
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,840
 Just give a data set

1738
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,840
 just at the beginning or just give this, right?

1739
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,840
 Give it to you.

1740
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,840
 Give it to you, right?

1741
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,840
 I think this is it, right?

1742
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,840
 We just know the value there, right?

1743
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,840
 But after, you know,

1744
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,840
 through many steps, right?

1745
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,840
 Look at the features, the natures

1746
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,840
 and then by looking at the median

1747
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,840
 and mean values.

1748
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,840
 Certainly now we have better understanding

1749
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,840
 of the data set, right?

1750
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,840
 Better understanding.

1751
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,840
 Okay.

1752
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,840
 So that's actually,

1753
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,840
 before, certainly we should

1754
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,840
 understand our data, right?

1755
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,840
 We cannot just call a function

1756
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,840
 and then put the data in

1757
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,840
 and then get a model

1758
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,840
 based on the model to make a prediction.

1759
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,840
 Our task is to get a good model

1760
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,840
 to make accurate prediction.

1761
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,840
 It not just a get a model

1762
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,840
 get a prediction.

1763
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,840
 Your work, your job here

1764
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,840
 is not just to lend this code.

1765
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,840
 Your job is to get a good result

1766
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,840
 to graduate with a high GPA, right?

1767
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,840
 So that's the same thing, right?

1768
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,840
 So we show that you

1769
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,840
 you understand the data

1770
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,840
 in order to actually produce the best model

1771
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,840
 and the best prediction

1772
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,840
 from the model.

1773
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,840
 Okay.

1774
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,840
 So through, actually until now,

1775
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,840
 we have looked into the

1776
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,840
 central tendency,

1777
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,840
 and checked that it's different between

1778
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,840
 mean and the median value,

1779
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,840
 and we have better understanding, right?

1780
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,840
 And also we have discovered

1781
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,840
 one issue in the data,

1782
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,840
 so the mission values.

1783
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,840
 Potential issue, otolias.

1784
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,840
 Okay.

1785
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,840
 So that's actually we understand

1786
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,840
 the data spread.

1787
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,840
 The dispersion or

1788
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,840
 actually we, yeah, okay,

1789
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,840
 the dispersion of the data.

1790
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,840
 Okay. The range of the data.

1791
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,840
 Okay. So that is

1792
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,840
 the data spread.

1793
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,840
 So, beside the central tendency,

1794
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,840
 we also need to look at the

1795
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,840
 actually the range of the data, right?

1796
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,840
 Look at the dispersion of the data.

1797
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,840
 And also position

1798
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,840
 of the different data values.

1799
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,840
 So these are the

1800
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,840
 actually another aspect,

1801
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,840
 another characteristic

1802
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,840
 of the data, the spread.

1803
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,840
 Okay.

1804
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,840
 So for the dispersion,

1805
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,840
 actually, mirror,

1806
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,840
 so normally, you know,

1807
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,840
 we use the standard vision.

1808
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,840
 So here, actually, we can see

1809
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,840
 why we need to have this

1810
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,840
 mirror,

1811
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,840
 or have this understanding of the data

1812
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,840
 spread.

1813
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,840
 So here we have given

1814
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,840
 six values, five values,

1815
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,840
 right, five values,

1816
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,840
 and for

1817
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,840
 each one, attribute one

1818
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,840
 attribute two,

1819
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,840
 and actually both values,

1820
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,840
 both attributes

1821
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,840
 actually have a

1822
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,840
 mean value

1823
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,840
 of 46.

1824
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,840
 Actually, the two have the same mean value.

1825
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,840
 But if we look at the attribute one,

1826
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,840
 the value is 44,

1827
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,840
 46, 48, 45, 47,

1828
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,840
 the mean is 46.

1829
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,840
 That means all the values

1830
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,840
 are around the mean value, right?

1831
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,840
 So the spread is small.

1832
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,840
 Okay.

1833
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,840
 Actually, the range of the data is close

1834
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,840
 to actually the mean value.

1835
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,840
 But if we look at the

1836
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,840
 second attribute, right,

1837
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,840
 so 34,

1838
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,840
 now it's very far from the mean value

1839
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,840
 46, right, and also the

1840
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,840
 52, or 59,

1841
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,840
 very far away from 66.

1842
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,840
 That means the spread,

1843
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,840
 dispersion is very high.

1844
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,840
 The variation of the data

1845
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,840
 is very high.

1846
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,840
 And for this attribute,

1847
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,840
 actually number two.

1848
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,840
 And so actually,

1849
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,840
 to measure this

1850
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,840
 spread,

1851
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,840
 and quite often, we use the so-called

1852
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,840
 the variance.

1853
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,840
 So we practice how to

1854
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,840
 calculate the variance.

1855
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,840
 So, as you might see,

1856
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,840
 for the variable X, or feature X,

1857
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,840
 and so we have

1858
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,840
 n values.

1859
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,840
 So this is the average of

1860
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,840
 X squared.

1861
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,840
 For every

1862
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,840
 value for this feature,

1863
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,840
 right, so we take the

1864
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,840
 squared, get the summation, then get the average.

1865
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,840
 So this is the mean of X squared.

1866
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,840
 And then the second

1867
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,840
 part actually, so you look at the tree,

1868
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,840
 the one in the bracket, right inside the bracket,

1869
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,840
 so this is simply the mean of Xk,

1870
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,840
 the mean of X.

1871
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,840
 So this is the part actually,

1872
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,840
 the square of the mean, right?

1873
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,840
 So these are two, the variance

1874
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,840
 that equals

1875
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,840
 actually the mean of X squared,

1876
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,840
 right?

1877
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,840
 Minus the square of the mean of X.

1878
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,840
 Okay, so this is the

1879
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,840
 variance.

1880
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,840
 And actually,

1881
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,840
 certainly, actually,

1882
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,840
 we can have actually almost

1883
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,840
 an equivalent, right,

1884
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,840
 measure,

1885
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,840
 which is just the square root of the variance.

1886
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,840
 So this actually defined as

1887
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,840
 the standard deviation.

1888
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,840
 Standard deviation of sigma

1889
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,840
 actually equals the square root

1890
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,840
 of the variance of X.

1891
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,840
 Okay, so for

1892
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,840
 spread,

1893
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,840
 for data dispersion,

1894
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,840
 we use these two measures.

1895
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,840
 Okay, these two are actually identical, right?

1896
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,840
 So one is the standard deviation,

1897
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,840
 another is the variance.

1898
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,840
 So one of these is very

1899
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,840
 important, one of these measures, right?

1900
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,840
 So the general tendency,

1901
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,840
 and also to spread the variance

1902
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,840
 or the standard deviation measures

1903
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,840
 are important.

1904
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,840
 Actually, so later,

1905
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,840
 today, actually,

1906
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,840
 this week,

1907
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,840
 we'll see, week seven probably,

1908
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,840
 then we will study actually

1909
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,840
 one type of a Pennet classification,

1910
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,840
 actually, which is called actually

1911
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,840
 the linear,

1912
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,840
 just mean analysis.

1913
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,840
 And actually, we use standard

1914
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,840
 in the Pennet classification,

1915
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,840
 so what features normally we prefer?

1916
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,840
 So normally, we hope

1917
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,840
 the data in classification,

1918
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,840
 so what could be considered

1919
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,840
 as an easy task?

1920
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,840
 If, okay, the two classes

1921
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,840
 are very different,

1922
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,840
 and for all the samples

1923
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,840
 within the same class, they are similar,

1924
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,840
 then it is easy to differentiate,

1925
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,840
 easy to differentiate, okay?

1926
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,840
 So within class,

1927
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,840
 within class difference

1928
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,840
 is small.

1929
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,840
 Within the same class,

1930
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,840
 the samples should be very similar.

1931
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,840
 Between class,

1932
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,840
 the samples could be

1933
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,840
 very different.

1934
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,840
 Okay, so how to measure

1935
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,840
 actually

1936
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,840
 within class similarity?

1937
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,840
 How to measure this?

1938
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,840
 Within class, all the samples are similar.

1939
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,840
 Actually, this is

1940
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,840
 the spread of the data around the mean vector.

1941
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,840
 Normally, it's not just

1942
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,840
 the mean value, right?

1943
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,840
 So normally, we use multiple features,

1944
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,840
 so it's the mean vector.

1945
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,840
 So around the mean vector,

1946
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,840
 the spread is small.

1947
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,840
 Then, that means

1948
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,840
 within class,

1949
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,840
 similarity is high,

1950
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,840
 or the difference is small,

1951
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,840
 then to classify,

1952
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,840
 the classification task is easier.

1953
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,840
 Then, even between class,

1954
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,840
 the difference is big.

1955
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,840
 That means it is easy to differentiate

1956
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,840
 because the difference is big.

1957
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,840
 But how to measure the difference

1958
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,840
 between the two?

1959
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,840
 Actually, we use the distance

1960
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,840
 between the two mean vectors

1961
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,840
 of the sample in the two classes.

1962
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,840
 Okay, so from here, you can see

1963
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,840
 the importance of

1964
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,840
 the mean of sampling

1965
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,840
 within the same class,

1966
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,840
 and the spread of the sample

1967
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,840
 within the same class.

1968
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,840
 Actually, we try to find

1969
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,840
 even the features

1970
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,840
 and show that sample within the same class

1971
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,840
 could have a

1972
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,840
 small spread.

1973
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,840
 Okay, between class,

1974
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,840
 we could have a very big difference.

1975
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,840
 Okay, so that is the reason

1976
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,840
 why we need to look at

1977
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,840
 the central tendency, the mean

1978
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,840
 vectors, and also the variance.

1979
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,840
 Okay, and

1980
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,840
 all know,

1981
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,840
 correct metrics, even

1982
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,840
 high terminal space.

1983
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,840
 Okay, so these are

1984
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,840
 the two measures.

1985
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,840
 Through this data,

1986
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,840
 we can understand that

1987
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,840
 this problem is probably an easy task.

1988
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,840
 This problem could be

1989
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,840
 very challenging.

1990
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,840
 Even in a feature,

1991
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,840
 all the data are mixed.

1992
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,840
 If we are using the CGPA

1993
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,840
 to differentiate male and female students,

1994
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,840
 are you able to do that?

1995
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,840
 All the CGPA or male

1996
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,840
 or female students are overlapped.

1997
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,840
 You cannot differentiate.

1998
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,840
 Right?

1999
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,840
 So that is the reason why

2000
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,840
 we don't see

2001
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,840
 because of the

2002
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,840
 mean of the two,

2003
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,840
 the difference

2004
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,840
 between the classes

2005
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,840
 are small, right?

2006
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,840
 The difference is small.

2007
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,840
 So it's very hard.

2008
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,840
 It's a very hard task.

2009
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,840
 So through exploration

2010
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,840
 of the spread

2011
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,840
 and also the central tendency of the data,

2012
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,840
 certainly we can understand

2013
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,840
 whether this is an easy task

2014
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,840
 or this is a very challenging task.

2015
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,840
 Okay.

2016
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,840
 So you can also see

2017
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,840
 the reason why we need

2018
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,840
 to do this exploration, right?

2019
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,840
 Even before we perform millennium,

2020
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,840
 we need to perform such exploration

2021
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,840
 of the data

2022
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,840
 to understand the challenges

2023
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,840
 of the given task.

2024
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,840
 Okay.

2025
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,840
 Okay.

2026
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,840
 So next actually is a column

2027
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,840
 data value position.

2028
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,840
 Just now we see for the

2029
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,840
 spread of the data, look at the dispersion,

2030
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,840
 look at the various,

2031
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,840
 all standard divisions, right?

2032
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,840
 Here we also look at the actually

2033
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,840
 and the position of the data.

2034
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,840
 So the position of some values.

2035
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,840
 So here the mean of five values,

2036
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,840
 the position of five values.

2037
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,840
 Okay. So this position of five values

2038
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,840
 also to describe

2039
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,840
 the characteristics of the data.

2040
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,840
 By analyzing these five values,

2041
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,840
 we can also actually

2042
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,840
 have a better understanding

2043
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,840
 about the data distribution.

2044
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,840
 Okay.

2045
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,840
 So which hold the five value, right?

2046
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,840
 Actually,

2047
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,840
 just now we talk about the media, right?

2048
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,840
 If we put the data in a sequence,

2049
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,840
 sending all the, or descending all the,

2050
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,840
 we can find the middle, right?

2051
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,840
 A middle point. So the middle value is just the media.

2052
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,840
 Okay.

2053
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,840
 So the middle value divide the whole data

2054
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,840
 in the data sequence

2055
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,840
 actually into two half, right?

2056
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,840
 The first half, the second half.

2057
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,840
 Okay. For the first half,

2058
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,840
 we can also find the middle value, right?

2059
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,840
 The middle value, the median value.

2060
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,840
 Okay. And actually the first half,

2061
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,840
 the median value of the first half of the data

2062
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,840
 is called quanta,

2063
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,840
 the first quanta or q1.

2064
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,840
 So we define this value, right?

2065
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,840
 This is actually the first quanta,

2066
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,840
 this is 25%.

2067
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,840
 You rank the data, right?

2068
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,840
 So this is 25%.

2069
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,840
 What is this mean?

2070
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,840
 This is q1, the first quanta.

2071
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,840
 Okay.

2072
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,840
 And then for the second half,

2073
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,840
 certainly you can find,

2074
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,840
 you know, the middle value, right?

2075
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,840
 So this middle value actually is 75%.

2076
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,840
 So this is called

2077
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,840
 that quanta.

2078
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,840
 Q3.

2079
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,840
 Actually, Q2 is just the median,

2080
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,840
 the overall median of the data.

2081
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,840
 So the 50%.

2082
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,840
 So q1 is 25%, right?

2083
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,840
 Q2 is 50%, the one in the middle, right?

2084
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,840
 Q3 is actually 75%,

2085
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,840
 actually, percent.

2086
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,840
 Okay.

2087
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,840
 So normally this is called percent tau, right?

2088
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,840
 25% tau,

2089
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,840
 actually, you know, 50%

2090
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,840
 percent tau

2091
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,840
 and 75%

2092
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,840
 percent tau.

2093
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,840
 Okay. So these are q1, q2, q3.

2094
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,840
 Okay.

2095
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,840
 And besides these,

2096
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,840
 the three values,

2097
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,840
 and we also have another two values.

2098
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,840
 That is called

2099
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,840
 minimum value and the maximum value.

2100
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,840
 So remember, this is the minimum value

2101
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,840
 and not the minimum smallest value

2102
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,840
 in the sequence.

2103
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,840
 And not the maximum value in the sequence.

2104
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,840
 So later we will see

2105
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,840
 how to find this, actually,

2106
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,840
 minimum value and maximum value.

2107
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,840
 Okay. So these are the five values.

2108
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,840
 Five values.

2109
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,840
 Okay.

2110
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,840
 So for example,

2111
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,840
 actually,

2112
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,840
 the auto-MPG dataset, right?

2113
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,840
 And we have, actually,

2114
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,840
 this data.

2115
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,840
 And also we have found,

2116
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,840
 actually, the q1,

2117
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,840
 q2.

2118
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,840
 Q2 is just the media, overall media,

2119
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,840
 just q2 and q3.

2120
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,840
 And also the minimum

2121
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,840
 and the maximum.

2122
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,840
 And actually, for

2123
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,840
 displacement,

2124
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,840
 we can also find the value.

2125
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,840
 For origin, we can also find the values.

2126
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,840
 Okay.

2127
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,840
 So these are the,

2128
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,840
 yeah.

2129
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,840
 So this table, you know,

2130
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,840
 just to summarize, actually,

2131
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,840
 these five values.

2132
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,840
 Q1, q2, q3,

2133
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,840
 25% howl,

2134
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,840
 50% howl,

2135
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,840
 75% howl.

2136
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,840
 Minimum maximum.

2137
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,840
 And actually, through,

2138
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,840
 actually, and like this,

2139
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,840
 q1, q2, q3,

2140
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,840
 and we can also

2141
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,840
 discover some issues of the data.

2142
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,840
 Okay.

2143
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,840
 And for example,

2144
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,840
 actually,

2145
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,840
 we look at the difference

2146
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,840
 between q1

2147
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,840
 for the displacement,

2148
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,840
 right, the displacement, which continues.

2149
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,840
 And actually,

2150
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,840
 the q1,

2151
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,840
 so here, actually,

2152
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,840
 the calculator, actually, the q1,

2153
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,840
 38.

2154
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,840
 Right?

2155
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,840
 I don't know, right, right?

2156
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,840
 68.

2157
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,840
 Sorry.

2158
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,840
 68, right?

2159
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,840
 And then, actually, the,

2160
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,840
 sorry, the,

2161
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,840
 104, 104,

2162
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,840
 the q1, right?

2163
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,840
 And then, actually,

2164
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,840
 we see the minimum distance between the minimum

2165
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,840
 and the q1 is 36.2, right?

2166
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,840
 And the difference

2167
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,840
 between q1 and the median

2168
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,840
 is 44.3, okay?

2169
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,840
 And, okay,

2170
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,840
 but actually, this is for the,

2171
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,840
 for the first half, right?

2172
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,840
 Then we look at the second half,

2173
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,840
 and the q3 is 11.5,

2174
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,840
 and,

2175
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,840
 okay, so I think q3

2176
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,840
 is

2177
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,840
 262, right?

2178
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,840
 262, and the difference

2179
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,840
 between, actually, the median

2180
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,840
 and the, this is q3

2181
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,840
 is 113.5,

2182
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,840
 and q3, the maximum value

2183
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,840
 difference is 103, okay?

2184
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,840
 You can see, actually, in the first half,

2185
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,840
 actually, the difference between the minimum

2186
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,840
 and the q1, the difference between q1

2187
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,840
 and q2, this value is small, right?

2188
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,840
 But actually, for the

2189
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,840
 second half of data, that means, actually,

2190
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,840
 from q2, q3, and the maximum, right?

2191
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,840
 Then the difference is 100

2192
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,840
 something, much bigger than the

2193
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,840
 previous part, right?

2194
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,840
 So, actually, from this difference,

2195
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,840
 actually, we can see some problems,

2196
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,840
 okay? So, that means that the data,

2197
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,840
 the larger values are more

2198
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,840
 spread, spread out in the,

2199
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,840
 okay, in the,

2200
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,840
 the larger values spread out,

2201
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,840
 okay?

2202
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,840
 Then, actually, the small values, okay?

2203
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,840
 So, actually, through data, you can also imagine

2204
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,840
 the data, right? If you previously

2205
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,840
 had experience of handling data, right?

2206
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,840
 So, you can imagine, oh, in the low data,

2207
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,840
 in low part, they are

2208
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,840
 concentrating in that part, but for the

2209
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,840
 high values, they spread out.

2210
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,840
 So, you can have some imagination, right?

2211
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,840
 You can imagine the data distribution.

2212
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,840
 This kind of data normally is called skewed.

2213
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,840
 Skewed, okay?

2214
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,840
 The skewness of the data also

2215
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,840
 presents challenges

2216
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,840
 to machine learning to modeling.

2217
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,840
 Okay? So, through this analysis,

2218
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,840
 we can discover issues with the data,

2219
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,840
 right? And then, we can

2220
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,840
 actually, you know, adopt, you know,

2221
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,840
 necessary actions or measures

2222
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,840
 to address all these issues.

2223
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,840
 But if you don't do this kind of exploration,

2224
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,840
 you cannot find the issue.

2225
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,840
 Okay? You just, oh, this is a number, right?

2226
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,840
 So,

2227
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,840
 you cannot just look

2228
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,840
 at the number to, to discover the issues.

2229
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,840
 You need to do the exploration, right?

2230
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,840
 You look at the central mean,

2231
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,840
 the central tendency,

2232
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,840
 look at the spread of the data,

2233
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,840
 look at, you know, the, actually, the

2234
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,840
 farm numbers.

2235
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,840
 Okay?

2236
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,840
 Okay.

2237
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,840
 And the next, I think, is for

2238
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,840
 illustration of the farm numbers,

2239
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,840
 and, actually,

2240
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,840
 we can use the so-called, actually, the box plot.

2241
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,840
 Give the numbers, right?

2242
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,840
 But maybe, you know,

2243
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,840
 if we can visualize the data distribution,

2244
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,840
 probably, you know, we can understand

2245
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,840
 the problem even better, right?

2246
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,840
 Okay. So, this is the box plot.

2247
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,840
 And this diagram, actually,

2248
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,840
 box plot, actually, is just a visualization

2249
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,840
 of the farm numbers, right?

2250
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,840
 The position of the farm numbers.

2251
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,840
 Okay. The mean, the M1,

2252
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,840
 Q1, Q2, Q3, right?

2253
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,840
 Actually, in the box plot,

2254
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,840
 so in the middle, there is a box.

2255
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,840
 So, this is why the reason why I call box plot, right?

2256
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,840
 There is a box. And, actually,

2257
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,840
 this boundary, the edge here,

2258
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,840
 is a Q3.

2259
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,840
 And then, in the middle,

2260
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,840
 there is a, you know,

2261
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,840
 a big line, right?

2262
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,840
 A big line.

2263
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,840
 This is just the

2264
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,840
 median, Q2.

2265
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,840
 Okay. So, we have Q1,

2266
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,840
 Q2, Q3.

2267
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,840
 Q1, Q2, Q3. So, these are three numbers.

2268
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,840
 And then, we also need to find, actually,

2269
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,840
 the minimum

2270
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,840
 and maximum.

2271
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,840
 Actually, the minimum and maximum are not

2272
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,840
 necessarily the minimum and maximum of the data.

2273
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,840
 Okay. So, naturally,

2274
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,840
 we look at, actually, how these minimum and maximum

2275
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,840
 values are found.

2276
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,840
 Okay. So,

2277
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,840
 so here, we

2278
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,840
 define a so-called

2279
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,840
 inter-quantum range,

2280
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,840
 which is the difference between Q3 and Q1.

2281
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,840
 We have Q1, Q2, Q3, right?

2282
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,840
 So, the difference between Q3

2283
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,840
 and Q1 is called

2284
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,840
 inter-quantum, actually, range,

2285
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,840
 AQR.

2286
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,840
 So, based on the one

2287
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,840
 AQR, actually, we can find the minimum

2288
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,840
 value and the maximum value.

2289
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,840
 Okay. So, from the

2290
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,840
 diagram here, actually,

2291
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,840
 now, we can extend this, actually,

2292
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,840
 further to Q1 minus

2293
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,840
 1.5,

2294
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,840
 actually, AQR,

2295
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,840
 to get the minimum.

2296
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,840
 Okay.

2297
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,840
 From the bottom of the box, Q1.

2298
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,840
 Okay. Then, we can get, actually,

2299
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,840
 so this gets a minimum.

2300
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,840
 Minimum. Okay.

2301
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,840
 So, we get 1.5, actually, times

2302
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,840
 of the AQR.

2303
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,840
 So, in this question, actually, Q1,

2304
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,840
 Q3, just to see that, and then Q,

2305
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,840
 Q3

2306
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,840
 is 79. Okay. Then, the AQR,

2307
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,840
 inter-quantum

2308
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,840
 range is Q3 minus Q1, right?

2309
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,840
 In the example, so it's

2310
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,840
 79 minus 73 is

2311
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,840
 6.

2312
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,840
 Okay. And then, we should, from the bottom,

2313
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,840
 the bottom Q, Q1, right?

2314
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,840
 Q1 is C3.

2315
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,840
 Q3, and then, from here,

2316
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,840
 we minus 1.5

2317
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,840
 times 6.

2318
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,840
 1.5 times AQR, right?

2319
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,840
 So, we should, actually, from,

2320
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,840
 actually, 73 minus AQR minus,

2321
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,840
 actually,

2322
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,840
 actually, 1.5 times

2323
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,840
 of the AQR,

2324
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,840
 then get 64.

2325
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,840
 But, this 64 is not

2326
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,840
 really the minimum.

2327
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,840
 Actually, the minimum should be found

2328
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,840
 from the data. Okay.

2329
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,840
 So, we should actually look at all the data

2330
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,840
 that is around

2331
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,840
 64. Okay. We should

2332
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,840
 find a one that is above 64.

2333
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,840
 Okay. For example,

2334
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,840
 in the real data, there,

2335
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,840
 actually, the data around 64 is

2336
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,840
 63, 70, and 60.

2337
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,840
 Okay. We should use

2338
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,840
 the value that is above

2339
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,840
 64 as the

2340
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,840
 minimum value. So, here,

2341
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,840
 actually, 1 is 70, right?

2342
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,840
 70. Okay.

2343
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,840
 So, we can use the minimum value.

2344
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,840
 Say 70 and the minimum value.

2345
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,840
 Okay. And then, if a value is

2346
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,840
 below the 70, it will be

2347
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,840
 considered as an outlier,

2348
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,840
 extreme values.

2349
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,840
 Okay. So, this is

2350
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,840
 the minimum value. And for the

2351
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,840
 maximum value, we should start from,

2352
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,840
 actually, the Q3.

2353
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,840
 Q3, right?

2354
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,840
 So, we should find the value

2355
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,840
 plus, actually,

2356
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,840
 1.5, actually,

2357
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,840
 accurate.

2358
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,840
 Okay. So, for

2359
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,840
 the Arbor Whisker, it's 10 to 1.5

2360
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,840
 in this question, right?

2361
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,840
 So, like, Q3

2362
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,840
 plus 1.5, accurate.

2363
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,840
 Q3, we already found the, know the

2364
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,840
 value, right? Q3 is 70 now.

2365
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,840
 And then times, then

2366
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,840
 plus, actually, now.

2367
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,840
 Okay. So, this should be,

2368
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,840
 actually, the maximum value.

2369
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,840
 Okay.

2370
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,840
 But whether this is, it should be

2371
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,840
 used as, actually,

2372
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,840
 the maximum value, no, actually,

2373
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,840
 we need to look at the data, right?

2374
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,840
 We should find one that is

2375
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,840
 slightly below this 88

2376
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,840
 from the data sequence, okay?

2377
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,840
 So, from the data sequence,

2378
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,840
 from the data, we find, actually,

2379
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,840
 no, like, 82, 84, 89,

2380
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,840
 close to 88, right?

2381
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,840
 The one that is below this,

2382
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,840
 should be the one as the maximum

2383
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,840
 value.

2384
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,840
 Okay.

2385
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,840
 Okay. So, we use, actually,

2386
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,840
 84 as the maximum value.

2387
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,840
 Okay. Then the value above

2388
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,840
 84 will be considered as

2389
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,840
 extreme values, or like this.

2390
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,840
 Okay. So, if you look

2391
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,840
 back to this diagram, this is the

2392
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,840
 box plot.

2393
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,840
 This is the box plot, or some values, like,

2394
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,840
 this is not the box plot, right?

2395
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,840
 K1, K2, K3, the

2396
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,840
 minimum value, maximum value.

2397
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,840
 Then above here, can you see,

2398
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,840
 there are otolias,

2399
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,840
 extreme, low or extreme,

2400
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,840
 high values.

2401
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,840
 Okay. And these extreme, low or

2402
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,840
 extreme, high values,

2403
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,840
 that could be called by many reasons.

2404
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,840
 Could not be called by many reasons, right?

2405
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,840
 Sometimes, that could be called by errors.

2406
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,840
 Okay. And sometimes,

2407
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,840
 otolias are natural, right?

2408
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,840
 Just as an example, look at the

2409
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,840
 data, original wealth, right?

2410
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,840
 The wealth of

2411
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,840
 every person here you have,

2412
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,840
 and also the wealth by the

2413
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,840
 Mayan, the Bill Gates.

2414
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,840
 So, they are the value

2415
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,840
 otolias, but certainly, these

2416
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,840
 otolias are natural, right? In no

2417
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,840
 noise. Okay. By some

2418
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,840
 scenario, this actually could be,

2419
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,840
 you know, an error when you record

2420
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,840
 on the number, called by error.

2421
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,840
 Okay. So, you know, if

2422
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,840
 we are doing different, we have

2423
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,840
 different reasons, then probably we need

2424
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,840
 to use different actions or

2425
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,840
 measures to address these

2426
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,840
 otolias issues.

2427
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,840
 Okay. So, these are

2428
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,840
 the data, right? The box plot.

2429
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,840
 Actually, a lot of the function on my lab,

2430
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,840
 they provide this function. Give the data,

2431
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,840
 you know, otherwise, to plot this

2432
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,840
 box plot. Okay.

2433
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,840
 Just use the box plot, this function,

2434
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,840
 then you can plot this. Okay.

2435
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,840
 This is actually, in the diagram,

2436
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,840
 shows the box plot of the different

2437
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,840
 attributes.

2438
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,840
 The box plot, and for cylinder,

2439
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,840
 now you can see that the

2440
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,840
 shape is part different, right?

2441
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,840
 So, these show the data characteristics,

2442
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,840
 you know, are very different

2443
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,840
 from one feature to another feature.

2444
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,840
 Okay. Because if the

2445
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,840
 box plot doesn't look similar, right?

2446
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,840
 And then,

2447
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,840
 actually,

2448
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,840
 maybe the data distribution

2449
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,840
 will be similar. But here, then, you

2450
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,840
 look at that, they are very different, right?

2451
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,840
 They are very different.

2452
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,840
 Okay. So, this box plot

2453
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,840
 is a good visualization

2454
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,840
 tool, which can give us,

2455
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,840
 you know, a good understanding

2456
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,840
 about the data distribution.

2457
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,840
 Okay.

2458
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,840
 Just now, we see, you know,

2459
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,840
 for the displacement, actually, we find

2460
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,840
 that there are big difference, right?

2461
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,840
 Between the media and the mean values, right?

2462
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,840
 And in the, between Q3,

2463
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,840
 the difference between Q3 and the media,

2464
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,840
 right? And also, between the

2465
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,840
 difference between Q2, right?

2466
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,840
 And also, the

2467
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,840
 difference between the maximum

2468
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,840
 value and the Q3.

2469
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,840
 So, we have looked at that value.

2470
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,840
 And also, we have looked into the,

2471
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,840
 this value normally not big, right? Like 100.

2472
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,840
 But for the first half of the data,

2473
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,840
 the difference between the

2474
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,840
 minimum value and the Q1, actually,

2475
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,840
 it's small. The difference between Q2

2476
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,840
 and Q1 is small. That is something, right?

2477
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,840
 So, we see all the data is probably

2478
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,840
 spread out in the, for larger

2479
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:39,840
 values. Okay. So, this diagram

2480
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,840
 should show the, you know, there's a

2481
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,840
 broad plot of the, you know, the

2482
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,840
 displacement. Actually, you can see the

2483
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,840
 data, right? In data, you know, this

2484
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,840
 is a medium, right? So, for the larger

2485
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,840
 range, right? This actually

2486
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,840
 indeed spread out for the larger

2487
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,840
 values, right? For the larger values.

2488
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,840
 For small values, they are more

2489
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,840
 concentrated.

2490
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,840
 For this part, a big difference,

2491
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,840
 right? Between the maximum value

2492
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,840
 and the medium and the Q3.

2493
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,840
 And also, the difference between Q3

2494
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,840
 and the, and the mean.

2495
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,840
 So, this is actually the very effective

2496
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,840
 visualization tool, right?

2497
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,840
 Both plots are very visualized tool.

2498
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,840
 Which can help us

2499
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:19,840
 to have a good understanding about the

2500
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,840
 data distributions.

2501
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,840
 Okay. The understanding of good

2502
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,840
 distribution of the data could

2503
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,840
 help us decide, you know,

2504
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,840
 what measures we should use

2505
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,840
 to address these issues.

2506
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,840
 For example, you know, if the data

2507
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,840
 is big value data, right?

2508
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,840
 Probably, you know, for the data, you

2509
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,840
 can take some, you know, many, many

2510
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,840
 operations. Like, you can take a

2511
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,840
 logarithm operation, right?

2512
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,840
 Then to actually reduce,

2513
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,840
 actually, to make the, you know,

2514
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,840
 to make the data less skewed.

2515
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,840
 Now, it's all known in the high part,

2516
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,840
 right? If you take a logarithm operation,

2517
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,840
 right? And then, the data

2518
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,840
 will be actually more evenly

2519
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,840
 uniformly distributed.

2520
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,840
 Okay. So,

2521
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,840
 through this operation, you can

2522
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,840
 find the issues.

2523
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,840
 Then you can take measures to address

2524
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,840
 the issues. Okay. And then,

2525
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,840
 finally, you can get a better model

2526
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,840
 which can produce a more

2527
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,840
 accurate predictions.

2528
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,840
 Okay. So, from here,

2529
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,840
 today until now,

2530
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,840
 I hope that you understand

2531
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,840
 the fitting model, not just

2532
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,840
 a core function, put the data in, right?

2533
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,840
 Actually, it's

2534
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,840
 very necessary to do this kind

2535
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,840
 of exploration, to understand

2536
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,840
 the data. And before,

2537
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,840
 actually, you know, to find the issues

2538
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,840
 also, and take some

2539
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,840
 measures to address the issues. And before

2540
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,840
 we apply input data

2541
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,840
 to the learning algorithm

2542
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,840
 to fit a model.

2543
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,840
 Okay.

2544
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,840
 So,

2545
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,840
 next, actually, visualization tool

2546
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:07,840
 is called histogram.

2547
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,840
 Histogram. Just now, we just

2548
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,840
 see the fine-value position, right?

2549
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,840
 Q1, Q2, Q3, minimum,

2550
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,840
 maximum, right? Then we have

2551
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,840
 box plot. They give us an understanding,

2552
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,840
 right? And actually, a histogram

2553
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:21,840
 is another effective

2554
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,840
 visualization tool,

2555
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,840
 right? To visualize the data distribution.

2556
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,840
 Okay. In this, actually, histogram,

2557
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,840
 normally, we divide the data

2558
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:31,840
 into many

2559
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,840
 beams. For example, the data

2560
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:35,840
 is from the value from

2561
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,840
 1 to 10,

2562
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,840
 for example, right? You

2563
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,840
 can divide the whole range

2564
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:43,840
 into 10 beams,

2565
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,840
 okay? From

2566
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,840
 0, or from 1 to 10, right?

2567
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,840
 From 11 to 20,

2568
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:51,840
 okay? From 21

2569
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,840
 to 30, okay? You have different

2570
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,840
 range. And this is called

2571
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,840
 beams. And then you

2572
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,840
 check how many data

2573
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,840
 points, actually,

2574
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,840
 fall into this range.

2575
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:05,840
 Then you call the number,

2576
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,840
 okay? Then you can explore this.

2577
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,840
 So this is called, actually, the histogram.

2578
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,840
 So the horizontal

2579
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,840
 shows the values, okay? So here,

2580
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,840
 you can see this, right? So this is

2581
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,840
 a beam from here to

2582
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,840
 this value, right? From here to here,

2583
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,840
 actually, the whole range

2584
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,840
 is divided into many beams. Of

2585
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,840
 course, in the function, often,

2586
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,840
 the default value is set to 10,

2587
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,840
 but you can decide the

2588
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,840
 beam number. You can also

2589
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:33,840
 decide, actually, the beam size,

2590
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,840
 the range of the beam, from

2591
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,840
 which, you know,

2592
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,840
 from which, starting from

2593
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,840
 which value, and

2594
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,840
 to what value, right? This other range

2595
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,840
 of the beam. You can define normally,

2596
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,840
 okay? Then, actually, we call

2597
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:49,840
 the number. So this diagram

2598
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,840
 shows the distribution of the data,

2599
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,840
 right? So here, the first one,

2600
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,840
 symmetric uniform. You can see

2601
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,840
 in all the beams, right? The number,

2602
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,840
 actually, horizontal shows the number

2603
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,840
 of the cost, how many data

2604
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,840
 points, how many values,

2605
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,840
 okay? How many values are in this

2606
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,840
 range, okay? So here,

2607
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,840
 they're all similar, right? Similar.

2608
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,840
 Doesn't mean the data distribution is

2609
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:13,840
 quite even, right? Uniform,

2610
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,840
 uniform.

2611
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,840
 Uniform is quite uniform, the

2612
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,840
 first one, right? Then the second one,

2613
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,840
 as you can see, this is symmetric,

2614
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,840
 like, you know,

2615
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,840
 this is symmetric, right?

2616
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,840
 A union model,

2617
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,840
 union model, union mean single,

2618
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,840
 right? Uniform model, just

2619
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,840
 one peak. So this is quite like,

2620
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,840
 you know, Gaussian distribution,

2621
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,840
 right? Gaussian distribution. So

2622
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,840
 from here, oh, this sample, this data

2623
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,840
 point, this is no feature,

2624
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,840
 probably the data following normal

2625
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,840
 distribution. You can look at this,

2626
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,840
 this is quite similar to a normal

2627
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,840
 distribution, right?

2628
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,840
 And then look at another no data,

2629
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,840
 this is actually skewed, skewed,

2630
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,840
 this is called left skewed,

2631
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,840
 okay? And then this is quite,

2632
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,840
 actually, this is a right skewed,

2633
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,840
 skewed, okay?

2634
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,840
 And then from here, this is actually

2635
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,840
 like a bi-modal,

2636
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,840
 because here we can see like two peaks,

2637
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,840
 right? From here to here,

2638
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,840
 then from here to here. So probably,

2639
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,840
 actually, the feature shows two

2640
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,840
 points, right? So we can see

2641
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,840
 that the two peaks are normal

2642
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,840
 distribution. If you want to build

2643
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,840
 a model for this kind of distribution

2644
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,840
 and we can use the so-called Gaussian

2645
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,840
 and Mischem model. So in the next week,

2646
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,840
 when we study actually one

2647
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,840
 approach, which is the statistical

2648
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,840
 approach for pendant classification

2649
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,840
 and actually one important part

2650
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,840
 of this algorithm is to

2651
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:37,840
 estimate the probability distribution

2652
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,840
 function, probability density function,

2653
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,840
 okay? It's called class conditional

2654
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,840
 normal distribution. And then we need

2655
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,840
 to find the parameter of model

2656
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,840
 distribution to fit the data, right?

2657
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,840
 But sometimes the data maybe

2658
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,840
 cannot be modeled by one single

2659
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,840
 actually, the normal distribution function.

2660
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,840
 It will be modeled by

2661
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,840
 multiple

2662
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,840
 normal distribution functions.

2663
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,840
 So that is the Gaussian-Mischem model,

2664
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,840
 right? So through

2665
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,840
 this analysis, this histogram,

2666
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:07,840
 we can discover the data, right?

2667
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,840
 Or there are two peaks, something like that,

2668
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,840
 probably there are two. We can use

2669
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,840
 the two normal

2670
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,840
 Gaussian functions

2671
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,840
 to actually model

2672
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,840
 this data distribution, right?

2673
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,840
 So if you don't actually plot

2674
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,840
 this histogram, actually we cannot

2675
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,840
 have this understanding, right?

2676
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,840
 Then you probably just use one.

2677
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,840
 Then you fit the model. It's like, oh,

2678
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,840
 the performance is not satisfactory.

2679
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,840
 You don't know the reason. Why?

2680
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,840
 But actually through this analysis

2681
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,840
 of the data, through this, actually,

2682
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,840
 the histogram, we can understand

2683
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,840
 actually the data

2684
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,840
 for normal distribution, but we need

2685
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,840
 to use more than one

2686
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,840
 normal distribution function, right?

2687
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,840
 More than one Gaussian function

2688
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,840
 to fit the data, right?

2689
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,840
 So we can discover

2690
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,840
 the root cause of the problem,

2691
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,840
 right? Then you can take

2692
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,840
 measures, right? Use the two

2693
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:01,840
 Gaussian functions

2694
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,840
 actually to model the distribution,

2695
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,840
 okay? So here probably

2696
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,840
 there are multiples, right? So there is

2697
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:09,840
 one Gaussian function here, another Gaussian function.

2698
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,840
 So here we need to use

2699
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,840
 more than two in multiple Gaussian

2700
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,840
 functions, Gaussian-Mitcher model

2701
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,840
 actually

2702
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,840
 to fit the data.

2703
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,840
 Okay, you can see, you know, right?

2704
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,840
 Sometimes we fit the data, get a color

2705
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,840
 function, performance not satisfactory.

2706
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,840
 We don't know the reason, right?

2707
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,840
 But through exploration

2708
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,840
 of the data, we can find actually

2709
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,840
 the issues, right? So these

2710
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,840
 issues, these phenomena, these

2711
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,840
 information can guide us

2712
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,840
 to decide the supermodels

2713
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,840
 actually for this specific

2714
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,840
 task.

2715
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:45,840
 Okay, and then actually

2716
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,840
 you can get a better model

2717
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,840
 to make more accurate predictions.

2718
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,840
 Okay, so we have a ten minute break.

2719
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:05,840
 Okay.

2720
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,840
 Okay.

2721
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,840
 Okay.

2722
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,840
 Okay.

2723
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,840
 Okay.

2724
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,840
 Okay.

2725
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:05,840
 Okay.

2726
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:35,840
 Okay.

2727
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:05,840
 Okay.

2728
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,840
 Okay.

2729
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:05,840
 Okay.

2730
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,840
 Okay.

2731
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:05,840
 Okay.

2732
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,840
 Okay.

2733
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,840
 Okay.

2734
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:35,840
 Okay.

2735
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,840
 Okay.

2736
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:07,840
 Okay.

2737
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,840
 So both plots and

2738
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,840
 the histogram

2739
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,840
 are provided with

2740
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,840
 effective tools

2741
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,840
 and for visualization of the data

2742
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:19,840
 distribution.

2743
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:25,840
 Okay.

2744
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:27,840
 And actually here we can have a look

2745
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,840
 of the distribution

2746
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:31,840
 and all the histogram

2747
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,840
 and different attributes

2748
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,840
 in the auto-MPG data set.

2749
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:37,840
 Right?

2750
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,840
 And then we can see actually the

2751
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,840
 distribution, right?

2752
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:43,840
 Are quite different, right?

2753
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,840
 For some data set, right?

2754
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,840
 For

2755
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,840
 MPG and for all other like

2756
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:51,840
 model years, it's quite

2757
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:53,840
 uniform, right? Quite uniform.

2758
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:55,840
 But for some of them like

2759
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:57,840
 for this acceleration, right?

2760
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:59,840
 It follows like a normal distribution.

2761
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,840
 So you can see the different characteristics

2762
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:03,840
 of the different attributes

2763
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:05,840
 in the data set. Okay.

2764
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,840
 Certainly, through

2765
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:09,840
 exploration of the data, right?

2766
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,840
 Particularly visualization of the data distribution

2767
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:15,840
 by the histogram

2768
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:17,840
 or the both plots, we can have

2769
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:19,840
 a better understanding about the data.

2770
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,840
 So certainly this help us

2771
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:23,840
 to decide on the suitable models

2772
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,840
 and also the learning argument

2773
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,840
 for this data set.

2774
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,840
 Okay.

2775
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:31,840
 So necessarily

2776
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:33,840
 this is just the exploration

2777
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:35,840
 for the numerical data, right?

2778
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,840
 Quantitative data

2779
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:39,840
 or the continuous data.

2780
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:41,840
 Continuous

2781
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,840
 quantitative

2782
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,840
 of the numerical, right?

2783
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:47,840
 Sometimes actually

2784
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:49,840
 we use them mislead, right?

2785
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,840
 Externally, okay? So basically

2786
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,840
 we can

2787
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,840
 measure the mean. We can measure

2788
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,840
 the median. Okay.

2789
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:59,840
 So that's the measure of the central tendency.

2790
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,840
 We can also look at

2791
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:03,840
 the dispersion, the spread of the data.

2792
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,840
 Okay. And also plot

2793
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:07,840
 through the both plots

2794
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:09,840
 and also the histogram

2795
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,840
 to look at the data distributions.

2796
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:13,840
 Okay. And but for categorical

2797
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:15,840
 features

2798
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,840
 like gender, right?

2799
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:19,840
 Like the

2800
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:21,840
 gender, right? It's like

2801
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,840
 so we cannot actually use this

2802
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:25,840
 actually, you know, we cannot

2803
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:27,840
 carry the mean value. So what

2804
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,840
 the average of the gender

2805
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:31,840
 of this class?

2806
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,840
 We don't have the average of the gender,

2807
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:35,840
 right? So we don't have

2808
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:37,840
 average. We don't have the center

2809
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:39,840
 of the tendency. Okay. So then

2810
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:41,840
 actually how to

2811
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:43,840
 actually resale the data

2812
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:45,840
 and actually

2813
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:47,840
 we can actually

2814
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,840
 use a table. Use a table.

2815
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:51,840
 Okay. So

2816
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:55,840
 here actually, this table,

2817
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:57,840
 one table is for the

2818
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,840
 card name. Card name.

2819
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:01,840
 Actually we can

2820
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,840
 and the number of samples

2821
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,840
 that

2822
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:07,840
 take each of the values, right?

2823
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:09,840
 For acceleration, for this actually

2824
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,840
 this is for, I think this here

2825
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:15,840
 is for

2826
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:17,840
 card name, right? For card name.

2827
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,840
 So among all the cards, all the

2828
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,840
 samples, so how many cards actually

2829
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:23,840
 have this name? How many cards

2830
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:25,840
 have this name? How many cards have

2831
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:27,840
 this name? Okay. And for the

2832
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,840
 cylinder, right? So how many cards

2833
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,840
 have actually, I have

2834
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,840
 three. That's four, right? How

2835
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,840
 many cards have

2836
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,840
 four cylinders?

2837
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:39,840
 So these are two, four cards, right?

2838
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,840
 So this table also

2839
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,840
 can give an understanding about

2840
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,840
 the distribution, the value of

2841
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,840
 distributions. Okay. So like for

2842
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:49,840
 this actually, the second part

2843
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,840
 for the cylinder, we know

2844
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,840
 most of the cards have actually

2845
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:55,840
 four cylinders because there are

2846
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:57,840
 two, four, two hundred and

2847
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:59,840
 four cards have four

2848
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:01,840
 cylinders, right?

2849
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,840
 And actually one or three cards have

2850
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:05,840
 eight cylinders. Okay. So

2851
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:07,840
 very few cards have

2852
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:09,840
 three cylinders or five cylinders.

2853
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:11,840
 Okay. So this table can also

2854
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:13,840
 give us an understanding

2855
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:15,840
 about the data, the value

2856
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,840
 distribution. Okay.

2857
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:19,840
 So we cannot actually have this

2858
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:21,840
 actually the histogram

2859
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,840
 and also the BOSS plot

2860
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,840
 and for the categorical data

2861
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:27,840
 but we can only have this kind of

2862
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:29,840
 table. Okay.

2863
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:33,840
 Okay.

2864
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:35,840
 So that's actually is for the

2865
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:37,840
 relationship between the

2866
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:39,840
 variables, between the attributes

2867
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:41,840
 or features. Okay. And

2868
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:43,840
 as I said, the beginning

2869
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:45,840
 at the beginning of this class

2870
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:47,840
 we can talk about the relationship

2871
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:49,840
 between the features.

2872
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:51,840
 Right. And through

2873
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,840
 this actually relationship

2874
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:55,840
 actually we can explore the

2875
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,840
 interdependence of the data

2876
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:59,840
 or sometimes we call the redundancy

2877
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,840
 between the data.

2878
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,840
 Okay. So for this

2879
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:05,840
 actually the relationship is flourishing

2880
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:07,840
 we can use actually

2881
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:09,840
 actually the so called scatter plot

2882
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,840
 scatter plot. Actually

2883
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:13,840
 we can use one actually

2884
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:15,840
 to attribute

2885
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,840
 as the X axis

2886
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:19,840
 horizontal axis. We can

2887
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:21,840
 use another attribute

2888
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,840
 as the vertical axis.

2889
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:25,840
 So for each sample

2890
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:27,840
 actually we have an attribute

2891
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,840
 one value. We have attribute two value.

2892
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:31,840
 So the X1, X2 as a coordinate

2893
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:33,840
 we can find the location

2894
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:35,840
 in this adrenal plane.

2895
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:37,840
 So this is the BOSS plot

2896
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:39,840
 it just actually

2897
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:41,840
 one actually sample

2898
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:43,840
 okay. So this is like

2899
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:45,840
 a

2900
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:47,840
 displacement is horizontal

2901
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:49,840
 okay. And then vertical

2902
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:51,840
 actually the

2903
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:53,840
 mpg. So each data

2904
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,840
 each point here

2905
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:57,840
 circle here represent one

2906
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:59,840
 sample. For this sample

2907
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,840
 and the

2908
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:03,840
 value of displacement is this

2909
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:05,840
 and the value mpg and not the value.

2910
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:07,840
 We use these two values

2911
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:09,840
 as the coordinate

2912
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:11,840
 we can have

2913
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:13,840
 plot this position

2914
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:15,840
 coordinate is just a position

2915
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:17,840
 we can plot the data on this plane

2916
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:19,840
 so this order

2917
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:21,840
 and through this actually

2918
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,840
 scatter plot

2919
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:25,840
 actually we can find the relationship

2920
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:27,840
 between the data points.

2921
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,840
 If one stream case

2922
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:31,840
 you can imagine one stream case

2923
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,840
 the two attributes

2924
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,840
 actually are identical the same

2925
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:37,840
 they are coordinate the same

2926
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:39,840
 the coordinate is the same

2927
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:41,840
 and then actually

2928
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:43,840
 you can imagine actually

2929
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:45,840
 all the points actually

2930
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:47,840
 are on a straight line

2931
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:49,840
 on a straight line.

2932
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:51,840
 So this is an extreme case

2933
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:53,840
 the data

2934
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:55,840
 actually has severely correlated

2935
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:57,840
 because the data

2936
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,840
 with itself right

2937
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,840
 one attribute

2938
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:03,840
 the correlation between one attribute and itself

2939
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,840
 of course is one the maximum

2940
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,840
 of the two variables

2941
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:09,840
 so one on a straight line

2942
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:11,840
 on a straight line.

2943
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:13,840
 So this is a case that

2944
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:15,840
 when the samples are

2945
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:17,840
 when the two actually variable are severely correlated

2946
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:19,840
 that means the redundancy

2947
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:21,840
 there are redundancies

2948
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:23,840
 and then the two attributes

2949
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,840
 and then actually

2950
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,840
 the spread is quite narrow

2951
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:29,840
 along a line

2952
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:31,840
 but if the two

2953
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:33,840
 variables are independent

2954
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:35,840
 if you actually draw them

2955
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:37,840
 you can see

2956
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:39,840
 the data like a ball

2957
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:41,840
 X1, X2

2958
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:43,840
 or sphere shape

2959
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:45,840
 something like that

2960
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:47,840
 so these are strongly

2961
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:49,840
 independent

2962
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:51,840
 so these are the two extreme case

2963
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:53,840
 all the data points on one straight line

2964
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:55,840
 you can imagine

2965
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:57,840
 all the data points on one straight line

2966
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:59,840
 because the two attribute are the same

2967
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:01,840
 all the points on a straight line

2968
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:03,840
 so very narrow

2969
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:05,840
 very narrow

2970
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,840
 another way to spread

2971
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,840
 spread very much like a ball

2972
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,840
 this is a case

2973
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:13,840
 when the two features are independent

2974
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,840
 okay

2975
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:17,840
 so through these two extreme cases

2976
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:19,840
 and also we look at the true scenario

2977
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,840
 for a specific

2978
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:23,840
 feature

2979
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:25,840
 and another feature

2980
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:27,840
 then we can understand the

2981
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:29,840
 the correlation between the two

2982
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:31,840
 what are the

2983
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:33,840
 strong redundancy

2984
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:35,840
 or strong correlation between them

2985
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:37,840
 or the two variables are independent

2986
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,840
 so this is

2987
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:43,840
 through actually

2988
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:45,840
 analyzing

2989
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:47,840
 this scatter plot

2990
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:49,840
 we can have a basic understanding

2991
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:51,840
 about the relationship between the variables

2992
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:53,840
 okay

2993
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:55,840
 sometimes the tree one variable

2994
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:57,840
 another variable has a proportionate relationship

2995
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:59,840
 okay so again they are on a straight line

2996
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:01,840
 they are not

2997
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:03,840
 actually along a straight line

2998
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:05,840
 not exactly on the straight line

2999
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:07,840
 but narrowly along the straight line

3000
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:09,840
 so this means the two features

3001
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:11,840
 are actually severely correlated

3002
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,840
 okay

3003
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:15,840
 so this is a scatter plot

3004
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:17,840
 I think there is another visualization tool

3005
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:19,840
 okay to understand the relationship

3006
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:21,840
 between two variables

3007
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:25,840
 okay

3008
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,840
 so this

3009
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:29,840
 of course this plot plot is for

3010
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:31,840
 continuous

3011
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:33,840
 attributes or features or variables

3012
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:35,840
 for discrete

3013
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,840
 or categorical

3014
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:39,840
 or actually

3015
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:41,840
 the sort of qualitative

3016
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,840
 data

3017
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,840
 now we can use the so called

3018
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:47,840
 two-way cross-tabulation

3019
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:49,840
 two-way

3020
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:51,840
 okay so this is actually just

3021
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:53,840
 such a table

3022
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:55,840
 one origin

3023
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:57,840
 another model year

3024
02:10:57,840 --> 02:10:59,840
 origin is a vertical

3025
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:01,840
 one denotes USA

3026
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:03,840
 two denotes Japan

3027
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:05,840
 three denotes Germany

3028
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,840
 all the car maker countries

3029
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:09,840
 so actually

3030
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:11,840
 so this middle year model year

3031
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:13,840
 70

3032
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:15,840
 60 70

3033
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,840
 1971

3034
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:19,840
 until 1982

3035
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:21,840
 so this is through the number

3036
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:23,840
 of cars made in USA

3037
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:25,840
 so the model years

3038
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:27,840
 so for the number of cars

3039
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:29,840
 in 1970-1922

3040
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:31,840
 okay so these are

3041
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,840
 so these are the cross-tables

3042
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:35,840
 two-way cross-tables

3043
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:37,840
 actually also give us

3044
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:39,840
 understanding about the relationship

3045
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:41,840
 between actually the

3046
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:43,840
 two

3047
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,840
 categorical variables

3048
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:53,840
 okay

3049
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:55,840
 so let's actually talk about

3050
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:57,840
 the data quality

3051
02:11:57,840 --> 02:11:59,840
 and actually

3052
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,840
 remediation

3053
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:03,840
 at the beginning already talk about

3054
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:05,840
 the importance of data quality

3055
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:07,840
 right

3056
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:09,840
 so actually

3057
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:11,840
 this is very important the success

3058
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,840
 of machine learning

3059
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:15,840
 largely depends on the quality of the data

3060
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:23,840
 so but in practice

3061
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:25,840
 we could encounter some issues

3062
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:27,840
 actually the data quality is not perfect

3063
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,840
 okay so we could

3064
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:31,840
 encounter some issues

3065
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:33,840
 and so there are two target problems

3066
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:35,840
 one is the mission values

3067
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:37,840
 problem

3068
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:39,840
 mission value actually

3069
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:41,840
 in the

3070
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:43,840
 we talked about the mean right

3071
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:45,840
 central tendency already

3072
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:47,840
 illustrate the mission value problem

3073
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:49,840
 for some of the features

3074
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:51,840
 for some of the samples

3075
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:53,840
 and as some features

3076
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:55,840
 the value are missing

3077
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:57,840
 okay so

3078
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:59,840
 actually the mission value could be caused

3079
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:01,840
 by different reasons

3080
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:03,840
 right and

3081
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:05,840
 for example if you ask

3082
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:07,840
 you to do an interview right

3083
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:09,840
 like an interview

3084
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:11,840
 of a student in NTU

3085
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:13,840
 and you can ask the tree

3086
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:15,840
 your opinion on different

3087
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:17,840
 policies or regulation

3088
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:19,840
 about NTU

3089
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:21,840
 you can have a tree

3090
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:23,840
 share your idea right

3091
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,840
 and then of course the tree

3092
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:27,840
 we can record down

3093
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:29,840
 your view on each of the

3094
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:31,840
 the regulation right

3095
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:33,840
 what is your thinking

3096
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:35,840
 what is your thought on this

3097
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:37,840
 I also give you a score as an evaluation

3098
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:39,840
 of this policy right

3099
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:41,840
 your satisfactory score on this

3100
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:43,840
 but sometimes the tree you ask this

3101
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:45,840
 but you don't want to comment on that

3102
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:47,840
 scenario they just

3103
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:49,840
 don't have a record of your score

3104
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:51,840
 about certain policy

3105
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:53,840
 so this could be called

3106
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:55,840
 this could cause a mission value right

3107
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:57,840
 for that particular sample

3108
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,840
 for that particular attribute

3109
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:01,840
 sometimes

3110
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:03,840
 you give the answer for the

3111
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:05,840
 the recorder forgot to record

3112
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:07,840
 write down this value

3113
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:09,840
 okay so there are many reasons

3114
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:11,840
 that cause the mission value problem

3115
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:17,840
 and

3116
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:19,840
 so the data

3117
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:21,840
 sometimes the data elements

3118
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:23,840
 normally the attributes

3119
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:25,840
 have values

3120
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:27,840
 surprisingly different

3121
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,840
 from the other elements

3122
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:31,840
 extremely low values

3123
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:33,840
 or extremely high values

3124
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:35,840
 so these are the outliers

3125
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:37,840
 they are very different from other values

3126
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:39,840
 just like an example

3127
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:41,840
 talk about the income right

3128
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:43,840
 talk about the wealth

3129
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:45,840
 but then suddenly some are

3130
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:47,840
 being in that

3131
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:49,840
 they are outliers

3132
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:51,840
 outliers also could be called by many reasons

3133
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:53,840
 why not they are naturally outliers

3134
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:55,840
 okay

3135
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:57,840
 and maybe in such a scenario

3136
02:14:57,840 --> 02:14:59,840
 maybe we take the wrong

3137
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,840
 wrong data right

3138
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:03,840
 you just look at the average

3139
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:05,840
 or the normal

3140
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:07,840
 like Singaporean or Chinese

3141
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:09,840
 household income

3142
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:11,840
 but actually you just normal

3143
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:13,840
 the common right people

3144
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:15,840
 but you include some billionaires

3145
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:17,840
 so these actually

3146
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:19,840
 could cause by the incorrect sample

3147
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:21,840
 set selection

3148
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:23,840
 maybe you use it

3149
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:25,840
 you normally use some of the data

3150
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:27,840
 so you should not use the data

3151
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:29,840
 billionaires to calculate the

3152
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:31,840
 average income

3153
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:33,840
 of the ordinary people

3154
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:35,840
 but actually you use that

3155
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:37,840
 so these actually outliers

3156
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:39,840
 could be cause by the incorrect

3157
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:41,840
 sample set

3158
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:43,840
 and also could be cause by

3159
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:45,840
 errors

3160
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:47,840
 when you record down this value

3161
02:15:47,840 --> 02:15:49,840
 you record it wrongly

3162
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:53,840
 so this wrong value

3163
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:55,840
 could be

3164
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:57,840
 outlier

3165
02:15:57,840 --> 02:15:59,840
 okay

3166
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,840
 so these are the two

3167
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:03,840
 main issues actually

3168
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,840
 or two frequently encountered issues

3169
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:07,840
 in the data

3170
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:09,840
 if we have these issues

3171
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:11,840
 then we must actually

3172
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:13,840
 eliminate these problems

3173
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:15,840
 we must address these problems

3174
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:17,840
 before actually we apply this data

3175
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:19,840
 to the learning algorithm

3176
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:21,840
 okay

3177
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:23,840
 so next we look at

3178
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:25,840
 the data remediation

3179
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:27,840
 remediation how to handle these

3180
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:29,840
 problems

3181
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:31,840
 if we have missing values

3182
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:33,840
 if we have outliers

3183
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:35,840
 okay

3184
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:37,840
 first we look at

3185
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:39,840
 the handling of the outliers

3186
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:45,840
 so we already understand actually

3187
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:47,840
 what is outlier

3188
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:49,840
 extremely low or extremely high values

3189
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:51,840
 very different from other values

3190
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:53,840
 so these

3191
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:55,840
 values can see as outlier

3192
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:57,840
 okay

3193
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:59,840
 so one simple way is to

3194
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:01,840
 remove outliers

3195
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:03,840
 if one sample has actually

3196
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:05,840
 like you know

3197
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:07,840
 in one specific feature

3198
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,840
 value is extremely high

3199
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,840
 extremely low so I think the easiest way

3200
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:13,840
 to

3201
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:15,840
 handle this outlier problem

3202
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:17,840
 is just to remove the whole

3203
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:19,840
 that sample

3204
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:21,840
 to remove that sample

3205
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:23,840
 so we can remove the outliers

3206
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:27,840
 so for every sample

3207
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:29,840
 if there is one attribute

3208
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:31,840
 containing outlier value

3209
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:33,840
 extremely low or extremely high values

3210
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:35,840
 we can just remove

3211
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:37,840
 this that sample

3212
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:39,840
 okay

3213
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,840
 so of course this is the easiest way to do that

3214
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:43,840
 just remove that

3215
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:45,840
 by checking the sample

3216
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:49,840
 so this is also a way to improve the data quality

3217
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:51,840
 and also the quality of the model

3218
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:53,840
 right

3219
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:55,840
 so that is the reason why we see we need to

3220
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:57,840
 explore the data

3221
02:17:57,840 --> 02:17:59,840
 we need to look at the quality

3222
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:01,840
 of the outliers

3223
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:03,840
 we must address these outliers

3224
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:05,840
 and the mission value problems

3225
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:07,840
 okay

3226
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:09,840
 so remove the outliers

3227
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:11,840
 then we can improve the quality of the data

3228
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,840
 and another is

3229
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:17,840
 the imputation

3230
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:19,840
 so we

3231
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:21,840
 if the outliers are extremely high

3232
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:23,840
 extremely low

3233
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:25,840
 maybe we see this could be caused by

3234
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:27,840
 the errors

3235
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,840
 correct this error

3236
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:31,840
 correct this error

3237
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:33,840
 but how to correct this error

3238
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:35,840
 so what value we should use

3239
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:37,840
 to replace these extremely low

3240
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:39,840
 or extremely high values

3241
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:41,840
 actually we can use the average

3242
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:43,840
 we can use the average

3243
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,840
 actually we can use the

3244
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:47,840
 mean

3245
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:49,840
 media or mode

3246
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:51,840
 to replace these extremely low

3247
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:53,840
 or extremely high values

3248
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:55,840
 we just believe

3249
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:57,840
 we can use the average values

3250
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:59,840
 but now we want to use the value

3251
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:01,840
 to replace that

3252
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:03,840
 but what value to use

3253
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:05,840
 actually then we can

3254
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:07,840
 naturally we can think about

3255
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,840
 the media

3256
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:11,840
 or mean

3257
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:13,840
 or the mode

3258
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:15,840
 we can replace

3259
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:17,840
 the outliers

3260
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:19,840
 using these values

3261
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:21,840
 okay

3262
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:23,840
 so we don't remove the outliers

3263
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:25,840
 we replace them with the extreme low

3264
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:27,840
 or high values

3265
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:29,840
 but we change the values

3266
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,840
 replace the extreme low or high values

3267
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:33,840
 using the mean media or mode

3268
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:37,840
 okay another is

3269
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:39,840
 caping

3270
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:41,840
 so these extremely low or extremely high

3271
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,840
 so just now I dream when we have the

3272
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:45,840
 box plot we have the 5 number

3273
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:47,840
 summary

3274
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:49,840
 q1 q3 the minimum

3275
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:51,840
 maximum

3276
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:53,840
 and naturally the minimum

3277
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:55,840
 value or maximum value in the data

3278
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:57,840
 actually we have ways to calculate the

3279
02:19:57,840 --> 02:19:59,840
 minimum maximum

3280
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:01,840
 based on q1 and then we subtract

3281
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:03,840
 actually 1.5

3282
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:05,840
 actually the accurate

3283
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:07,840
 into quantal range

3284
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:09,840
 and for q

3285
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,840
 for maximum from q3

3286
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:13,840
 plus 1.5

3287
02:20:13,840 --> 02:20:15,840
 the accurate right

3288
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:17,840
 so we have this value

3289
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:19,840
 we have minimum and maximum

3290
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:21,840
 value

3291
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:23,840
 extreme low

3292
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:25,840
 we know this area

3293
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:27,840
 so we just

3294
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:29,840
 replace the value

3295
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:31,840
 using the minimum value to replace

3296
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:33,840
 if the value is extremely high

3297
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:35,840
 we use the maximum value

3298
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:37,840
 to replace

3299
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:39,840
 okay so this method is called

3300
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:41,840
 caping

3301
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:43,840
 okay and here

3302
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:45,840
 actually you can also use

3303
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:47,840
 different like you can use

3304
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:49,840
 the minimum

3305
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:51,840
 95%

3306
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:53,840
 q1 is 25%

3307
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:55,840
 you can use the 5%

3308
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:57,840
 you don't use the minimum

3309
02:20:57,840 --> 02:20:59,840
 we use the value

3310
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:01,840
 that is the 5%

3311
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:03,840
 the maximum value we don't use the maximum value

3312
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:05,840
 we can use the 95%

3313
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:07,840
 actually the percent

3314
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:09,840
 okay

3315
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:11,840
 so this is the

3316
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:15,840
 okay this is

3317
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:17,840
 caping method

3318
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:19,840
 okay so this is

3319
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:21,840
 another scenario is that

3320
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:23,840
 if there is extreme signal number of

3321
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:25,840
 otolias

3322
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:27,840
 extreme number of otolias

3323
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:29,840
 then they should be treated differently

3324
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:31,840
 separately

3325
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:33,840
 we know among the 200 samples

3326
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:35,840
 or like you know

3327
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:37,840
 50 samples or 25%

3328
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:39,840
 right

3329
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:41,840
 have extreme value otolias

3330
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:43,840
 and maybe these otolias are natural

3331
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:45,840
 otolias right they are not caused by error

3332
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:47,840
 okay so here

3333
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:49,840
 in such a scenario

3334
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:51,840
 actually we should treat them

3335
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:53,840
 the data normal data

3336
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:55,840
 as one group

3337
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:57,840
 and then the data with otolias

3338
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:59,840
 extreme values otolias into another group

3339
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:01,840
 okay then we can build a model

3340
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:03,840
 separately for the two groups

3341
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:05,840
 okay

3342
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:07,840
 and

3343
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:09,840
 then if we make predictions

3344
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:11,840
 then we can just look at the data

3345
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:13,840
 whether this data is normal data

3346
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:15,840
 otolias

3347
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:17,840
 then we can decide which model to use

3348
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:19,840
 okay this is another way

3349
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:21,840
 to handle the otolias

3350
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:23,840
 problem

3351
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:25,840
 okay so for one single problem

3352
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:27,840
 actually we have multiple solutions

3353
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,840
 but actually of course each of the solutions

3354
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:31,840
 is a purpose within

3355
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:33,840
 certain context

3356
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:35,840
 so you always need to

3357
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:37,840
 analyze

3358
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:39,840
 the given task

3359
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:41,840
 to analyze the

3360
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:43,840
 task specific data

3361
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:45,840
 to find the issues

3362
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:47,840
 and also to take

3363
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:49,840
 the corresponding measures

3364
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:51,840
 the best measures to address the issues

3365
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:53,840
 we always need to do the analysis

3366
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:55,840
 right

3367
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:57,840
 so here this is just actually one scenario

3368
02:22:57,840 --> 02:22:59,840
 a significant number

3369
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,840
 okay

3370
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:03,840
 so

3371
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:09,840
 if otolias are natural

3372
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:11,840
 right

3373
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:13,840
 actually you know they

3374
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:15,840
 are natural

3375
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:17,840
 so we should not amend them

3376
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:19,840
 so they are not caused by error

3377
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:21,840
 they are natural

3378
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:23,840
 so in such a scenario maybe we just put them

3379
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:25,840
 into two groups

3380
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:27,840
 that is a good solution

3381
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:29,840
 okay

3382
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:31,840
 so here is a tree we see the mission value problem

3383
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:33,840
 right mission values

3384
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:35,840
 there are some mission values

3385
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:37,840
 and then of course the tree we can

3386
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:39,840
 the simple way to eliminate the sample with mission value

3387
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:41,840
 right so this is the simplest way

3388
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:43,840
 is to eliminate records

3389
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:45,840
 or sample having a mission value

3390
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:47,840
 because we have a treasure marker

3391
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:49,840
 right we cannot decide the value

3392
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:51,840
 we simply remove this value

3393
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:53,840
 remove the sample

3394
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:55,840
 any sample has a mission value

3395
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:57,840
 we can remove that

3396
02:23:57,840 --> 02:23:59,840
 if we have an extreme low or high value

3397
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:01,840
 otolias they can remove that

3398
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:03,840
 so actually this is one way to address the problem

3399
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:05,840
 but not necessarily the best way

3400
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:07,840
 it is a way

3401
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:09,840
 to address the otolias problem

3402
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:11,840
 to address the mission value problem

3403
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:13,840
 but not necessarily the best way

3404
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:15,840
 okay so the eliminate records

3405
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:17,840
 or sample having

3406
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:19,840
 a mission value

3407
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:21,840
 okay

3408
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:25,840
 so this is normally

3409
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:27,840
 applicable when the number

3410
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:29,840
 of samples with mission

3411
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:31,840
 mission value is limited

3412
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:33,840
 a small proportion

3413
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:35,840
 you have like

3414
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:37,840
 only 10% or 5% of the data

3415
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:39,840
 mission values right 5%

3416
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:41,840
 and if you have a large number

3417
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:43,840
 of samples then remove

3418
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:45,840
 of these 5% of the data

3419
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:47,840
 will not affect our learning result

3420
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:49,840
 much okay then can just remove

3421
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:51,840
 right so this is normally

3422
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:53,840
 is applicable can be adopted

3423
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:55,840
 and such a scenario

3424
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:57,840
 the removal of these samples

3425
02:24:57,840 --> 02:24:59,840
 will not affect

3426
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:01,840
 the learning result much

3427
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:03,840
 okay so

3428
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:05,840
 we can remove them

3429
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:07,840
 just actually in this example

3430
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:09,840
 here I give

3431
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:11,840
 originally I did the data

3432
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:13,840
 392 samples

3433
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:15,840
 and actually we found

3434
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:17,840
 the 6th sample has a mission value

3435
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:19,840
 just now we see the 6th sample

3436
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:21,840
 of question mark mission value

3437
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:23,840
 of these 6 samples

3438
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:25,840
 we still have 380

3439
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:27,840
 86 samples right

3440
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:29,840
 so just actually

3441
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:31,840
 like 6

3442
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:33,840
 how many percent

3443
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:35,840
 2%

3444
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:37,840
 yeah less than 2% of data

3445
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:39,840
 have mission value

3446
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:41,840
 remove all this percentage

3447
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:43,840
 of the data will not affect

3448
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:45,840
 the learning much

3449
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:47,840
 okay then we can

3450
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:49,840
 take this simple way to remove them

3451
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:53,840
 okay

3452
02:25:57,840 --> 02:25:59,840
 so this will not be possible

3453
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:01,840
 actually if many data

3454
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:03,840
 points have mission values

3455
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:05,840
 20%

3456
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:07,840
 392 samples

3457
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:09,840
 over 100 samples have mission values

3458
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:11,840
 if you remove

3459
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:13,840
 100 samples

3460
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:15,840
 then actually this will affect

3461
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:17,840
 the learning result very much

3462
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:19,840
 so then in such a scenario

3463
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:21,840
 remove

3464
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:23,840
 through this preset you can see

3465
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:25,840
 we always analyze this problem

3466
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:27,840
 analyze

3467
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:29,840
 we look at the scenario

3468
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:31,840
 and the different scenarios we have different solutions

3469
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:33,840
 okay

3470
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:37,840
 then of course the next actually

3471
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:39,840
 is imputing the mission values

3472
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:41,840
 okay

3473
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:43,840
 we don't try to remove

3474
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:45,840
 actually the samples because of just one mission

3475
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:47,840
 value right

3476
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:49,840
 in some many scenarios

3477
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:51,840
 the data collection is not easy

3478
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:53,840
 in particularly in biomedical research

3479
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:55,840
 right and actually

3480
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:57,840
 or just now as an example you interview

3481
02:26:57,840 --> 02:26:59,840
 the student about the policy

3482
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:01,840
 interview can take maybe like 10 minutes

3483
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:03,840
 okay just because of one value

3484
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:05,840
 actually in mission

3485
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:07,840
 then you remove the sample

3486
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:09,840
 then this 10 minutes effort

3487
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:11,840
 is wasted

3488
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:13,840
 right so

3489
02:27:13,840 --> 02:27:15,840
 so this actually in some scenarios

3490
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:17,840
 the data collection is very expensive

3491
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:19,840
 and you just have a limited number of samples

3492
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:21,840
 we should not remove

3493
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:23,840
 actually the sample instead

3494
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:25,840
 we should take some other measures

3495
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:27,840
 actually

3496
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:29,840
 compensate the mission value

3497
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:31,840
 to address the mission value problem

3498
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:33,840
 so here is imputing the mission values

3499
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:35,840
 we should just like

3500
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:37,840
 apply it right we should replace

3501
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:39,840
 we should give a value

3502
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:41,840
 right for this mission value

3503
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:43,840
 actually what value to give

3504
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:45,840
 actually we can of course

3505
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:47,840
 like I mean previously for the otlias

3506
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:49,840
 we can use the media and use the

3507
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:51,840
 mean and we can use the mode

3508
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:53,840
 right to replace

3509
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:55,840
 to assign to this

3510
02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:57,840
 actually mission value

3511
02:27:57,840 --> 02:27:59,840
 so this is the mission value

3512
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:01,840
 and actually

3513
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:03,840
 we kind of another issue right

3514
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:05,840
 and in particular

3515
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:07,840
 I think

3516
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:11,840
 for the actually for the

3517
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:13,840
 samples right

3518
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:15,840
 sometimes actually we don't use the overall

3519
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:17,840
 mean or overall

3520
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:19,840
 media but even in classification

3521
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:21,840
 problem we know

3522
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:23,840
 this sample belongs to class one

3523
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:25,840
 belongs to class one

3524
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:27,840
 and then actually we should not use

3525
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:29,840
 the overall mean or media

3526
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:31,840
 to compensate

3527
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:33,840
 actually to assign

3528
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:35,840
 the overall mean or media to this

3529
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:37,840
 mission value right

3530
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:39,840
 we should not use the overall

3531
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:41,840
 mean or media to assign

3532
02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:43,840
 to this mission value

3533
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:45,840
 so we should know look at

3534
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:47,840
 this sample belongs to class one

3535
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:49,840
 right so it's more

3536
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:51,840
 similar to sample of class one

3537
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:53,840
 then we should use the

3538
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:55,840
 media or mean value of sample

3539
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:57,840
 of class one to replace

3540
02:28:57,840 --> 02:28:59,840
 this question mark

3541
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:01,840
 but this is actually certainly

3542
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:03,840
 we will improve the accuracy

3543
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:05,840
 right so this is one method

3544
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:07,840
 another method is that

3545
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:09,840
 we even within the same class

3546
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:11,840
 right because

3547
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:13,840
 within the same class they also have a dispersion

3548
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:15,840
 right spread

3549
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:17,840
 although the spread may be small

3550
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:19,840
 but for some samples

3551
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:21,840
 actually if we look at other features

3552
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:23,840
 with no mission value

3553
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:25,840
 then we find actually the most similar samples

3554
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:27,840
 so based on other features

3555
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:29,840
 we find which sample is

3556
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:31,840
 most similar to this

3557
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:33,840
 to the sample with the mission value

3558
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:35,840
 then we look at the feature

3559
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:37,840
 and we look at the value of that

3560
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:39,840
 sample

3561
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:41,840
 we just use that value

3562
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:43,840
 to replace the question mark

3563
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:45,840
 this is probably

3564
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:47,840
 I think is another way right

3565
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:49,840
 so we analyze the problem

3566
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:51,840
 although we also impute the mission value

3567
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:53,840
 but we could have different ways

3568
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:55,840
 right

3569
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,840
 okay so this is the

3570
02:29:57,840 --> 02:29:59,840
 yeah

3571
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:03,840
 and actually you know for another example

3572
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:05,840
 for the horsepower

3573
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:07,840
 and so

3574
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:09,840
 they also based on the

3575
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:11,840
 relationship right we actually

3576
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:13,840
 previously we see we can use

3577
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:15,840
 relationship between the

3578
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:17,840
 variables right between the variables

3579
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:19,840
 if we know the horsepower

3580
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:21,840
 is probably is more similar

3581
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:23,840
 is correlated with

3582
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:25,840
 with the

3583
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:27,840
 cylinder with the cylinder right

3584
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:29,840
 so actually oh then we can look at

3585
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:31,840
 you know if this sample

3586
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:33,840
 actually have cylinder like 8

3587
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:35,840
 right like 8

3588
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:37,840
 so because these two variables are correlated

3589
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:39,840
 and then we can look at

3590
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:41,840
 all the data with

3591
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:43,840
 8 cylinder

3592
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:45,840
 8 okay and then we

3593
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:47,840
 can look at this sample

3594
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:49,840
 along the

3595
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:51,840
 horizontal along the feature

3596
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:53,840
 so what are the values

3597
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:55,840
 then we take the average

3598
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:57,840
 of this sample with 8

3599
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:59,840
 cylinders

3600
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:01,840
 we use this one value to replace

3601
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:03,840
 the mission values

3602
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:05,840
 right we use the most

3603
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:07,840
 relevant samples based on

3604
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:09,840
 the relationship between

3605
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:11,840
 the features

3606
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:13,840
 okay then we can

3607
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:15,840
 so this again the exploration of the

3608
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:17,840
 relationship between the features or attributes

3609
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:19,840
 and then it is important right

3610
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:21,840
 this can help us to

3611
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:23,840
 improve actually the solution

3612
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:25,840
 and for the mission value

3613
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:27,840
 problem

3614
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:29,840
 so here you know you always need to analyze

3615
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:31,840
 not just see a given problem

3616
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:33,840
 actually just adopt that

3617
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:35,840
 not so easy

3618
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:37,840
 we always need to analyze

3619
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:39,840
 look at the perspective problem

3620
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:41,840
 look at the characteristics of the data

3621
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:43,840
 then apply or adopt

3622
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:45,840
 or develop propose a new solution

3623
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:47,840
 okay

3624
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:53,840
 so these are

3625
02:31:57,840 --> 02:31:59,840
 I think these are the estimating

3626
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:01,840
 mission values

3627
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:03,840
 actually this

3628
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:05,840
 estimation is that actually

3629
02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:07,840
 the features are not correlated

3630
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:09,840
 just not already see two features correlated

3631
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:11,840
 actually the features

3632
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:13,840
 can also be correlated with many variables

3633
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:15,840
 we can always use other variables

3634
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:17,840
 to fit another variable

3635
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:19,840
 to fit

3636
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:21,840
 so we can use

3637
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:23,840
 the mission value for this feature

3638
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:25,840
 we can use actually

3639
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:27,840
 to build a model

3640
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:29,840
 another model

3641
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:31,840
 to use other features to predict these features

3642
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:33,840
 with mission values

3643
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:35,840
 okay so that is estimating

3644
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:37,840
 mission values

3645
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:39,840
 so there are many solutions

3646
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:41,840
 to the mission value problem

3647
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:43,840
 okay

3648
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:45,840
 so these are like

3649
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:51,840
 the solution to the two main problem

3650
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:53,840
 the mission value problem

3651
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:55,840
 and the otolayer problem

3652
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:57,840
 so that is actually look at the data preprocessing

3653
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:59,840
 so you still remember

3654
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:01,840
 after the exploration

3655
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:03,840
 the last step is preprocessing

3656
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,840
 preprocessing here means the scaling

3657
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:07,840
 of the features

3658
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:09,840
 so here for scaling

3659
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:11,840
 we talk about two main methods

3660
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:13,840
 one is called normalization

3661
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:15,840
 another is called standardization

3662
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:17,840
 of the data

3663
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:19,840
 so scaling is

3664
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:21,840
 very important

3665
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:23,840
 in machine learning

3666
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:25,840
 so what is feature scaling

3667
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:27,840
 feature scaling is

3668
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:29,840
 the data preprocessing technique

3669
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:31,840
 to transform the values

3670
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:33,840
 of features of different range

3671
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:35,840
 to a similar range

3672
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:37,840
 so this is called feature scaling

3673
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:45,840
 so this is the purpose to ensure

3674
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:47,840
 that all features contribute equally

3675
02:33:47,840 --> 02:33:49,840
 to the model

3676
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:51,840
 to avoid the domination of features

3677
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:53,840
 with big values

3678
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:55,840
 so later through one example

3679
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:57,840
 we can see

3680
02:33:57,840 --> 02:33:59,840
 why the big values

3681
02:33:59,840 --> 02:34:01,840
 dominate

3682
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:03,840
 we should try to avoid this problem

3683
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:11,840
 and this is

3684
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:13,840
 normally

3685
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:15,840
 in machine learning

3686
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:17,840
 we need to calculate the distance

3687
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:19,840
 between the samples

3688
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:21,840
 the distance

3689
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:23,840
 the distance is used as a similarity measure

3690
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:25,840
 distance

3691
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:27,840
 and how to calculate the distance between two features

3692
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:29,840
 normally we look at the difference

3693
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:31,840
 between

3694
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:33,840
 each attribute

3695
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:35,840
 between the two samples along each attribute

3696
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:37,840
 then square

3697
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:39,840
 then summarize them together

3698
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:41,840
 so for example GPA

3699
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:43,840
 and most of the file

3700
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:45,840
 4.5

3701
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:47,840
 then square is 0.25

3702
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:49,840
 but if you look at the body weight

3703
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:51,840
 something like 50, something like 100 kg

3704
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:53,840
 then the difference

3705
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:55,840
 50

3706
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:57,840
 square

3707
02:34:57,840 --> 02:34:59,840
 2500

3708
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:01,840
 so it's known that the body weight

3709
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:03,840
 actually will dominate

3710
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:05,840
 in the calculation of the similarities

3711
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:07,840
 between the samples

3712
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:09,840
 because this feature takes big values

3713
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:11,840
 we should try to avoid this problem

3714
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:13,840
 so

3715
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:15,840
 this is because

3716
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,840
 in many machine learning algorithms

3717
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:19,840
 we need to calculate the distance between

3718
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:21,840
 each sample

3719
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:23,840
 one of the examples is

3720
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:25,840
 the nearest neighbor

3721
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:27,840
 distance-based learning algorithm

3722
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:29,840
 and then

3723
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:31,840
 for actual learning

3724
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:33,840
 the K-means classroom

3725
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:35,840
 also based on the distance to determine the similarity

3726
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:37,840
 of the samples

3727
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:39,840
 and the support machine

3728
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:41,840
 they all use the distance

3729
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:43,840
 I think

3730
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:45,840
 most of them

3731
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:47,840
 actually

3732
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:49,840
 machine learning algorithms

3733
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:51,840
 use the distance between the samples

3734
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:53,840
 so we should try to avoid

3735
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:55,840
 the dominance of one feature

3736
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:57,840
 of others

3737
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:01,840
 and

3738
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:03,840
 so this is just one example

3739
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:05,840
 so initially

3740
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:07,840
 the salary in this range

3741
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:09,840
 all big values

3742
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:11,840
 the CGPA or small values

3743
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:13,840
 so after a brief scaling

3744
02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:15,840
 by certain method

3745
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:17,840
 later we will talk about two methods

3746
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:19,840
 and then all in a similar range

3747
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:21,840
 all in a similar range

3748
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:23,840
 so none of them will be dominant

3749
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:27,840
 so we should

3750
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:29,840
 use feature scaling to avoid the dominance

3751
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:31,840
 of one feature over others

3752
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:35,840
 so just to not show the example

3753
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:37,840
 and another

3754
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:39,840
 many algorithms

3755
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:41,840
 are based on the so-called gradient descent method

3756
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:43,840
 like neural network training

3757
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:45,840
 propagation algorithm

3758
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:47,840
 or deep neural network

3759
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:49,840
 of course

3760
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:51,840
 so many learning algorithms

3761
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:53,840
 the training of the model

3762
02:36:53,840 --> 02:36:55,840
 is based on the so-called gradient descent method

3763
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:57,840
 so here

3764
02:36:57,840 --> 02:36:59,840
 the gradient descent is a kind of

3765
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:01,840
 incremental learning

3766
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:03,840
 or sequential learning

3767
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:05,840
 so we will use this example

3768
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:07,840
 then we update the width

3769
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:09,840
 so these are the width in the step K

3770
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:11,840
 and these are the width in the next step

3771
02:37:11,840 --> 02:37:13,840
 so the second term here is update

3772
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:15,840
 the width update contains three

3773
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:17,840
 parts

3774
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:19,840
 one is the eta, the linear rate

3775
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:21,840
 another part is the gradient

3776
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:23,840
 the gradient of the first derivative

3777
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:25,840
 of the loss function

3778
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:27,840
 with respect to the parameter

3779
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:29,840
 then another is the feature

3780
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:31,840
 X

3781
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:33,840
 the feature is very different

3782
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:35,840
 and then the width update

3783
02:37:35,840 --> 02:37:37,840
 will be very different

3784
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:39,840
 because

3785
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:41,840
 the X i

3786
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:43,840
 1 is only 4.0

3787
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:45,840
 you input this and then you can have an update

3788
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:47,840
 another is 100

3789
02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:49,840
 in update

3790
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:51,840
 then the 1 with a larger value

3791
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:53,840
 will have a larger update

3792
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:55,840
 actually a very big

3793
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:57,840
 large update could also cause

3794
02:37:57,840 --> 02:37:59,840
 actually

3795
02:37:59,840 --> 02:38:01,840
 a very big probability of the linear

3796
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:03,840
 so

3797
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:05,840
 in the gradient descent method

3798
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:07,840
 we also try to

3799
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:09,840
 avoid big values

3800
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:11,840
 we should normalize them to small

3801
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:13,840
 values

3802
02:38:13,840 --> 02:38:15,840
 in a similar range

3803
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:17,840
 so these are the reasons why we

3804
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:19,840
 actually

3805
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:21,840
 perform the feature scaling

3806
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:23,840
 and before we

3807
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:25,840
 this is the last step

3808
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:27,840
 as the preparation

3809
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:29,840
 we will talk about

3810
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:31,840
 why is called normalization

3811
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:33,840
 normalization here

3812
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:35,840
 will transform the data

3813
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:37,840
 to the range

3814
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:39,840
 from 0 to 1

3815
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:41,840
 okay

3816
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:43,840
 so this is the formula we show you

3817
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:45,840
 this is a graph illustration

3818
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:47,840
 horizontal is the raw data X

3819
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:49,840
 then we can use

3820
02:38:49,840 --> 02:38:51,840
 find the minimum, we can find the maximum

3821
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:53,840
 and then we can

3822
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:55,840
 perform this transformation

3823
02:38:55,840 --> 02:38:57,840
 all the data will be in the range

3824
02:38:57,840 --> 02:38:59,840
 so actually the X minus

3825
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:01,840
 minimum value

3826
02:39:01,840 --> 02:39:03,840
 if you substitute

3827
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:05,840
 actually the numerator will become 0

3828
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:07,840
 so the minimum will map to 0

3829
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:09,840
 the maximum

3830
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:11,840
 will map to 1 because if something

3831
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:13,840
 maximum then the numerator

3832
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:15,840
 will not the same, cancel become 1

3833
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:17,840
 so the data will all data

3834
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:19,840
 no matter the original region

3835
02:39:19,840 --> 02:39:21,840
 range

3836
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:23,840
 after normalization they will all

3837
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:25,840
 be 0 from 0 to 1

3838
02:39:25,840 --> 02:39:27,840
 similar range

3839
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:29,840
 all the same range actually

3840
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:31,840
 and then another matter is called

3841
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:33,840
 standardization

3842
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:35,840
 standardization is to

3843
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:37,840
 actually

3844
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:39,840
 to

3845
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:41,840
 transform the data

3846
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:43,840
 so that the mean is 0

3847
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:45,840
 and 0

3848
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:47,840
 now we talk about the central tendency

3849
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:49,840
 the mean will be 0

3850
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:51,840
 after normalization

3851
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:53,840
 and standardization

3852
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:55,840
 the spread of the data will be 1

3853
02:39:55,840 --> 02:39:57,840
 so this is called standardization

3854
02:39:57,840 --> 02:39:59,840
 so why is it called standardization

3855
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:01,840
 this is because the tree for normalization

3856
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:03,840
 if the mean is 0

3857
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:05,840
 standardization is 1

3858
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:07,840
 this is called standard normalization

3859
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:09,840
 so this is probably the reason

3860
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:11,840
 of standardization

3861
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:13,840
 but quite often we don't differentiate the two

3862
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:15,840
 they all call normalization

3863
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:17,840
 so

3864
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:19,840
 as a data preparation step

3865
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:21,840
 normalize to 0, 1

3866
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:23,840
 or normalize to 0 mean

3867
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:25,840
 standardization of 1

3868
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:27,840
 and

3869
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:29,840
 previously a tree

3870
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:31,840
 I think here because you use the mean

3871
02:40:31,840 --> 02:40:33,840
 and the sigma

3872
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:35,840
 they are less likely

3873
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:37,840
 affected by the otolias

3874
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:39,840
 but previously the mean

3875
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:41,840
 I think is easier to

3876
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:43,840
 so these are the advantage and disadvantage

3877
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:45,840
 so this is the comparison

3878
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:47,840
 of the two methods

3879
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:49,840
 standardization and standardization

3880
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:51,840
 but actually

3881
02:40:51,840 --> 02:40:53,840
 sometimes if we use different techniques

3882
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:55,840
 we will obtain different results

3883
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:57,840
 and sometimes the difference is significant

3884
02:40:57,840 --> 02:40:59,840
 so always

3885
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:01,840
 we should try both

3886
02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:03,840
 then we find

3887
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:05,840
 the better performing one

3888
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:07,840
 so I think there is

3889
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:09,840
 there is no single

3890
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:11,840
 method performed the best for all applications

3891
02:41:11,840 --> 02:41:13,840
 always we should

3892
02:41:13,840 --> 02:41:15,840
 try different method

3893
02:41:15,840 --> 02:41:17,840
 so we should finally use the best

3894
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:19,840
 performing one

3895
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:21,840
 so here actually we also need to

3896
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:23,840
 try the two

3897
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:25,840
 the choice of them

3898
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:27,840
 normalization

3899
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:29,840
 or standardization

3900
02:41:29,840 --> 02:41:31,840
 depends on the problem

3901
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:33,840
 and always

3902
02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:35,840
 try the two

3903
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:37,840
 so that is the reason

3904
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:39,840
 in machine learning we need to start so many methods

3905
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:41,840
 because actually

3906
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:43,840
 we don't know which solution

3907
02:41:43,840 --> 02:41:45,840
 for the given task

3908
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:47,840
 we all need to try many of them

3909
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:49,840
 but of course you cannot try all of them

3910
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:51,840
 you should analyze the data

3911
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:53,840
 you should have a good understanding about

3912
02:41:53,840 --> 02:41:55,840
 assumptions for each of the learning algorithm

3913
02:41:55,840 --> 02:41:57,840
 for each of the model

3914
02:41:57,840 --> 02:41:59,840
 then you try those

3915
02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:01,840
 that could

3916
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:03,840
 potentially suit this specific application

3917
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:07,840
 so that is the reason

3918
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:09,840
 why we need to do these

3919
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:11,840
 exploration of the data

3920
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:13,840
 and try the data

3921
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:15,840
 before the data could be

3922
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:17,840
 input to the learning algorithm

3923
02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:19,840
 to fit the model

3924
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:21,840
 okay

3925
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:23,840
 I know

3926
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:25,840
 I didn't probably many of you actually

3927
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:27,840
 want to rush for the bus

3928
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:29,840
 so now

3929
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:31,840
 if you actually

3930
02:42:31,840 --> 02:42:33,840
 you want to stay here for some time

3931
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:35,840
 then you can just stay

3932
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:37,840
 and then I can answer your question

3933
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:39,840
 if you don't want to stay you can just go

3934
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:41,840
 and I will be back

3935
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:43,840
 and I will be back
