1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay. It looks like that works.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay.

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay.

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay. Look, it finally works.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't know what happened.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It seems very strange.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Anyway, let's start the class now.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I need some writing.

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Before going, let's start with the summary of the past two weeks.

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Prepare the summary.

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Week three and four, we are focusing on either linear models or linear estimators.

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I think these two are somewhat quite similar and related.

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:14,000
For linear models, we know the given data because we are only dealing with a finite number of major data.

16
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You put that as a vector.

17
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Always keep this in mind, what we will be doing.

18
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And then linear model means these linear functions of the true but unknown parameter vector.

19
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We also assume zeta.

20
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So both are not necessarily of the same dimension.

21
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Typically, dimension is h and zeta is reflected in the coefficient matrix, which is this h.

22
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And as I say, the number of samples, capital N, is normally larger than or at least equal to p.

23
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's the number of the unknown parameter zeta and this zeta vector.

24
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sometimes you call it n, so it's not that consistent, but you just base on the given one.

25
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In this case, it's reflecting the size of h.

26
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We normally assume this h is full-range.

27
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Full-range means t is smaller or at most equal to n.

28
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Then it would mean equal to the smaller one, which last week has spent quite some time going through the algebraic.

29
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And then there is an interesting result.

30
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If rank of h equal to p, you can prove this product of h transform.

31
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We are assuming this coefficient is also of full-range.

32
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But if the two matrix are different, say A transform multiplied by h,

33
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
even if both of them are full-range, the product may not necessarily be full-range.

34
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So we pay attention to that.

35
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And after that, we switch to linear unbiased estimator.

36
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The equation will be later.

37
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So I give you this illustration about under what condition,

38
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
blue means the best linear unbiased estimator is the shortfall for this.

39
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And if we are putting all the unbiased estimators in this,

40
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
then of course you only have two classes, either linear or non-linear.

41
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So for those linear, of course you may say non-linear includes linear.

42
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So what we say non-linear is those that are non-linear.

43
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And then what we are doing here is looking at this among all the linear, the best.

44
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We always assume dealing with a high sum.

45
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And if the MDUE is the one we always hope to get,

46
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
if it happens to be linear, among the linear subset,

47
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
then what do we get?

48
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We are looking for the best linear unbiased estimator.

49
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So it will be the optimal one.

50
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But however, if the MDUE happens to be non-linear,

51
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
so what do we get?

52
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Well, of course, the most suboptimal.

53
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And then how good it is will depend on how far away this blue from this MDUE.

54
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So this gives you the conceptual understanding about why the good size of getting the blue.

55
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Sometimes we still can get the optimal one,

56
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
but the limitation is in the case of the blue is very far away from the non-linear and MDUE,

57
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
then we may need to be more careful.

58
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So how to measure that?

59
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
As I say, if you are able to get the CRMP, that's to be of the best benchmark.

60
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If not, then you try out the more practical way.

61
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then how to do that?

62
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We start from scale case,

63
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
where this is only theta hat, the one where estimate is scaled.

64
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So we assume the expectation of this data sample is equal to a vector

65
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
multiplied by this scale.

66
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And we need to know the second order statistic, which is the covariance of the data.

67
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And then after that, we get the optimal coefficient vector in this way.

68
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And the variance, this coefficient vector, then of course, this is being linear.

69
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So our estimate would be just equal to the interval type of this, based on this,

70
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and just simply multiply this with x.

71
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And the value is even simpler.

72
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So you only take the denominator.

73
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You can substitute and put in and then somewhat cancel out and get this.

74
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,000
In this course, quite often we end up with a simpler solution.

75
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So you should always try your best to see how to simplify.

76
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And similarly for the vector case, the result is similar, the derivation is also similar,

77
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
but a little bit more involved because we need to use the matrix notation and so on.

78
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So going through this unit vector and so on.

79
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So I won't go into detail.

80
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So this is what we had so far for the first four weeks.

81
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And today I plan to finish the analysis with five.

82
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We have two more chapters among the classical estimation series,

83
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
which is MLE and the least square approach.

84
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And these are finished.

85
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I think you should be able to, because part of the least square is sequential one,

86
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
which is later combined into the Kalman filters, which is not for examination,

87
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
it's for your better understanding of the subject.

88
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So it's easier because I already uploaded the assignment at NTU.

89
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And by now you know the classical estimation theory.

90
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And the patient one, we try to finish next week because that's a little bit more difficult.

91
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But once you have a good understanding of the classical one,

92
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I hope you can at least understand the basics

93
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and can also do the two assignment questions when I take the basic one.

94
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes?

95
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The Kalman robot is if you are given the PDF or the likelihood function of the given data.

96
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So that's an assumption for both scale case or yes.

97
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But the CLB, CLB you can be right, but not the MBUE.

98
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So CLB is, actually CLB is independent of the data.

99
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So it's more based on the PDF of the data of the assumption.

100
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
This is a good question.

101
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So today the MBUE is quite important because there are more or less summarized what you have learned up to now.

102
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So including CLB, MBUE, and then of course naturally the MBUE makes you more likely.

103
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So maybe you can wait for whatever.

104
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I have another question.

105
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If we don't have the CLB and we find the best linear estimation,

106
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
we don't know if the minimum various approximation is linear or non-linear,

107
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
how can we judge if we found the optimal solution?

108
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, that's a good question.

109
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's why very often if you are given the limitation,

110
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
say for example, after MBUE, today we also discussed least square problems.

111
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Least square is another one similar to the group.

112
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You make some assumptions, but it doesn't require PDF.

113
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So this is what you need to compromise for those methods.

114
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Your requirement is less.

115
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They only require the second-order statistics.

116
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So you can try your best to get whatever you can, like suboptimal.

117
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But how good it is?

118
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Very often depending on, you know, for practical problem,

119
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,000
you will very much based on some kind of how to measure the performance

120
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
that you made based on the actual application you require.

121
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And also based on the data, sometimes you can also try to estimate from the data,

122
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
estimate the distribution from the noise and so on.

123
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And that's typically in image processing, how to get the noise,

124
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
you look at those in the image.

125
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Those part doesn't contain much useful object and so on, like the background.

126
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's not the same from there, your model noise.

127
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So noise typically will give you all the distribution of the noise that we have here.

128
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And similarly for data, you know, like for example, we are talking about rho eta,

129
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
so now you measure the data.

130
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And you know certain part you have contained maybe echo,

131
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
but the other part is very much noise.

132
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So from there you can estimate.

133
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So that's a more practical case.

134
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Because typically we are dealing with signal plus noise.

135
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So once you know the noise distribution, then you may be able to get better understanding.

136
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And the true parameter and so on, sometimes you may not directly get from the measure data.

137
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You may from other source, like nowadays data fusion is very common

138
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and it's very helpful, such as if you are using Wi-Fi data to do some estimation.

139
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
One of the projects we are doing currently is you get some estimation,

140
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
but the result may not be good.

141
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm also not sure how the grandchildren then agrees in the experiment.

142
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You can use camera, video to take and then from there you know roughly the grandchildren

143
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
because video camera, if you have the object there, it will give you better information.

144
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So from there you can judge, I mean, talking about the practical application.

145
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
From there you know roughly how good your algorithm is.

146
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And then the real implementation in practice, you don't get the camera

147
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
because we are looking at the enemies inside the door.

148
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Those you can't get camera.

149
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Then at least you know how good your algorithm is, even in the practical setting.

150
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So quite often you can verify your ground truth

151
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:45,000
or how good the algorithm is using another method, another modality and so on,

152
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
which may not be the final implementation of the algorithm you will be doing.

153
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So it involves a lot of common sense and other approaches.

154
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So our discussion here can cover all those other topics.

155
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So we typically like to make some assumptions and assume PDA is known

156
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and that's the best we can get.

157
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But if PDA is not available, you still can try with limited information from the main major data.

158
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Very good question.

159
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I know sometimes you do a practical project and you have some constraints and limitations.

160
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And that's why I work on some practical projects related to that.

161
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I get the sense of what you are asking.

162
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Good question.

163
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So I think today we will be doing something related to the...

164
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Although still it's through a toy example, you know, like the example where we have some assumptions.

165
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So let's start with the MLE.

166
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah.

167
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And let me see.

168
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Okay.

169
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So again here, let me switch to this one first.

170
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But I will need to keep this on going otherwise it will not.

171
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And then it cannot restart.

172
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah.

173
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So MLE here is...

174
00:18:47,000 --> 00:19:01,000
We are still trying to get the MLE, but if we can't get it using other method or at least not satisfactory,

175
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
such as blue will only give you the sub-optimal one.

176
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We will see whether there are other methods where you may be able to work.

177
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And in this sense, the method is what we call like the turned crank.

178
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You all know that nowadays in Singapore a lot of construction sites.

179
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So you will see a lot of crank, you know.

180
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So turned crank, the operator will just follow the simple instructions, doing one by one, step by step.

181
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And in MLEs, very often I always want to compare.

182
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's just like you are doing the derivation, you see.

183
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:13,000
If you are given an expression, you want to take a derivative, first order or second order, and so on.

184
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Again, it's like off.

185
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So anyway, let's fix it later.

186
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So that's why we come to discuss this MLE, maximum likelihood approach,

187
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:40,000
which is I will always say in the estimation theory part, this part one,

188
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:48,000
the two chapters, CIOB and MLE, are the most important ones,

189
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
which is true if you look at other lecture notes or books and so on.

190
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:07,000
They may not discuss certain topics, but they always need to cover the CIOB and MLE.

191
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And both of them happen to be required PDF or in another way is likelihood function.

192
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
These two are related.

193
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And one very important practical implication is for MLE, if you have large data records,

194
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:42,000
so your major data, the number of major sample is large, then you can also show that it will be optimal.

195
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Or also quite often you can approximate using the Gaussian distribution.

196
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And that's it.

197
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Let's see what we have here.

198
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So we start with scalar case, which you only have just one unknown parameter.

199
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And then we assume we have a PDF of this random sample, random variable X.

200
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But our X here is we typically measure more than one sample, even if the unknown parameter, you have just one unknown parameter.

201
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And the relationship between PDF or likelihood function is,

202
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:58,000
usually if you look at the function itself, it will be the same, but just two interpretation.

203
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm trying to work this one, but keep turning it off.

204
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Power saving.

205
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Enter power saving mode.

206
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Let me see if I need to start.

207
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Just don't know how this system works.

208
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:16,000
We say enter power saving mode, but I do not do anything here.

209
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Anyway, that's a big step.

210
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So let me try to explain from the figures here.

211
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's look at the case where I have Gaussian distribution.

212
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So you know Gaussian distribution, maybe I refer to another thing, because later I need to use it.

213
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Anyway, so let's see what we have here.

214
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Pentax Gaussian.

215
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Okay, Pentax.

216
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:47,000
This is the Gaussian.

217
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:59,000
If you look at the Gaussian distribution, you see, the random variable is Y.

218
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And then you all know Gaussian distribution, I will require you to memorize this, because it's very simple.

219
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Exponential signal, and then the random variable, subject to mean and variance.

220
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And say, for example, in the exams, I say the Gaussian distribution mean goes to M, variance equals to sigma power 2.

221
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
This sigma is a standard distribution.

222
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
They should be able to write this for R.

223
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And now if you consider if M is our unknown parameter, you see, and then if the mean is fixed, this is a function of Y.

224
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And the Y is the random variable.

225
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It will take the value over the lower axis, it can cover from minus infinity to positive infinity, something similar to this shape.

226
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And that's how you interpret and base on this PDF to see how the random variable will behave.

227
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And also from here, you all know that most likely the Y being a random variable, theoretically it can take even minus infinity.

228
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But the challenge is very small, because it's very unlikely.

229
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Most of the time, the value, even if you do realizations, it will be near the mean.

230
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
How near? Then that depends on the variance.

231
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
If the variance is very large, this random is quite random.

232
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So it's more chance to take up value quite far away from the mean.

233
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But still, most likely the highest chance of the value is near the mean.

234
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But it may not exactly be the mean.

235
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
For example, that's why we had earlier the simulation.

236
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:43,000
If the mean goes to 5, then actually it's very unlikely every time you will get exactly 5.

237
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But it could be very near 5, it could be 4.9, or the next round is 5.1, and so on.

238
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So that gives you the sense of how the random variable will behave.

239
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Now, on the other hand, we already take the sample, because our measured data is collected in the capital N sample.

240
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And then we want to, based on this sample, try to see what's the mean value based on the sample.

241
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So assume, actually our PDF is, we borrow this PDF concept.

242
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And in the actual implementation, we don't really need to go through the PDF.

243
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We use this PDF as an intermediate step to derive the MLE.

244
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So later you will see.

245
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So you already know, since given this measured data, and from the measured data we already know based on the PDF,

246
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
we are most likely saying here, here, here.

247
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's more concentrating near the mean value where this is what we call the data MLE.

248
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So based on this sample, we say for example you plot, and that's how in practical application.

249
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You don't really need to, actually you may not really know the, know the PDF.

250
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You may say, oh, given the PDF, given the PDF, we already know the, if you look at the expression,

251
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:55,000
the mean is if you are taking the maximum value of X, there will be a coincide.

252
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:04,000
As I already mentioned, also it's high chance to appear the random sample realization near this peak,

253
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
but you may not really get that peak.

254
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So what you do is fix this measured data, and then try to derive from the likely function.

255
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The likely function is the one when you fix the X.

256
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You don't treat X as random variable, but substitute is a fixed value,

257
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and that's the case where you measure the data.

258
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Each measured sample, you only measure one value, and then the next moment you measure another one.

259
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So from there you do the histogram, you see, based on histogram.

260
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:56,000
From there you get the peak, and this peak value of this likely function will give you the corresponding variable,

261
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
because now I plot this as a function of theta.

262
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:18,000
From there, we get the maximum value, and the corresponding argument will give us our best estimated value,

263
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:28,000
because this value is corresponding to where the samples are most likely to happen.

264
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Just now we looked at the PDF of the Gaussian distribution.

265
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So that's the easiest to understand, but of course you can extend it to, you want to get the variance,

266
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
it will also be the same.

267
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Given this likely function, you maximize, you get the maximum value, get the corresponding argument.

268
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So that's how this is derived.

269
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So that's the idea of the maximum likelihood.

270
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And then because, as I say, we derive this likely function from the corresponding PDF,

271
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:22,000
by fixing the random variable as some fixed value, and looking that as a function of theta.

272
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But as you can also see from the Gaussian distribution of the PDF, coming from the PDF, it will be positive functions.

273
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
PDF cannot take negative value.

274
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And quite often PDFs happen to be exponential for, say, Gaussian or the Rayleigh distribution and so on.

275
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So it's mostly related to exponential.

276
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So it's easier if we take a log.

277
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:05,000
But of course you don't take log, later with example you can directly get maximum.

278
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It also gives you the same result, because log function and not taking log is one-to-one corresponding.

279
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So that's how you can get either directly get the maximum or take the log.

280
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's the same.

281
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So let's look at how we apply to examples.

282
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So this example, I don't include some detail.

283
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So I hope that you are able to try to think and maybe do it as exciting.

284
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'll give you some idea, but I will skip the step.

285
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So perhaps going back you can try to do it and then maybe next week I will show you the details.

286
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So this one is a very good example.

287
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You can combine CLB, combine those variants and how to derive expectation and so on.

288
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So let's see how it works.

289
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So this is, the example looks the same as what we discussed before.

290
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
DC level and then white Gaussian noise.

291
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But however, if you pay attention here, you see our A here is a DC.

292
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
But this maybe, as I say, is a toy example, just to illustrate the concept.

293
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
In practice you may argue, will this ever happen or not.

294
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But let's look at the case if our noise, white Gaussian noise, should be assuming zero noise.

295
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Because we don't state the mean.

296
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But the variance is unknown and equal to A also.

297
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So this A is the same A.

298
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So A here is the unknown mean and then being a variant must be positive.

299
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So we assume this A is greater than zero.

300
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So this is unknown variant A.

301
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So then now you look at the PDF.

302
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
The PDF here, you see.

303
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So PDF is we interpret, we have a total number of N samples.

304
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So they are white.

305
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So you can just multiply them together because all of them have the same mean, which is A.

306
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And then also here, you see.

307
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So this A here is the, it will be the variant.

308
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So typically you have sigma power of two.

309
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So here is sigma power of two equal to A.

310
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And the same here, you see.

311
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
We have sigma power of two.

312
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So you replace by A.

313
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So that's the PDF.

314
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But if you interpret now, we want to get using MLE by deriving the maximum likelihood value for A.

315
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So how are we going to do, you see.

316
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So that's the basic, because now we have the PDF or the likelihood function.

317
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
We're assuming if we already measure the sample fixed.

318
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So we want to consider that as a function of A.

319
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So now you can, if you go back to this, you have A appear at three places.

320
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Again, this is the basic calculus.

321
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You don't need to turn the crank.

322
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You do it step by step.

323
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You should be able to do it.

324
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And then you can see after some little bit of simulation, derivation, you end up with these terms added together.

325
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But the question here is, so here you show the example where you can get the CLB, but you cannot get the efficient estimator.

326
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And also at least you cannot get the MUE from the CLB approach.

327
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So you can get the CLB because the first order derivative, you can verify it satisfies the regularity condition, attacking the mean.

328
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,000
The expectation will happen to be equal to zero.

329
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So then from here, because we cannot factorize this one.

330
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I mean, it's very hard to prove, but on the other hand, how to prove by, if you say yes, you can do it for me.

331
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But you can see from here it's almost very difficult or impossible because it's very hard to write into this way.

332
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And then remember this A must be depending on the data only, where this I of A is independent of data and this must be A.

333
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So anyway, this one cannot do, but we can still derive the CLB.

334
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So again, this is how to get the CLB is another routine exercise.

335
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Sometimes in some past year paper I make this as part of the question.

336
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So anyway, the CLB turned out to be quite simple.

337
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Also you have the complicated first order derivative.

338
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Now you can imagine the second order derivative, you can take more terms.

339
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But surprisingly after take expectation, because CLB is not everything depends on data.

340
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You're depending on the expectation, which it turned out to be quite often you can simplify.

341
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And that's why I want to ask you to do some of the assignment questions.

342
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It's quite easy, but you will see that turned out to be very simple in this form.

343
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So now let's see where this MLE to work.

344
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So MLE sometimes you may confuse CLB or even confuse with regularity condition.

345
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:11,000
The main difference is here, you see, both of them you get the first order, first derivative.

346
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And then the CLB approach, you try to factorize.

347
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
If you cannot, then you will stop here.

348
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You can continue to do the, you need to verify the regularity condition by packing the expectation

349
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
to make sure expectation is equal to zero.

350
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And the other day you continue to take the second derivative and so on.

351
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
But MLE is different.

352
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
MLE is you get the first derivative.

353
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And then remember when to get the maximum value out of that and solve for A.

354
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So you don't take expectation here.

355
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I emphasize, you don't take expectation.

356
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You directly lay this first order derivative equal to zero.

357
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And then solve the, in this case you only have to scale it.

358
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So you lay equal to zero, they will become a function of the unknown parameter A and also the data.

359
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So usually in practice it may become a non-linear function.

360
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
They only need to solve it numerically.

361
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So in some simple case, like in this case, it will turn out to be, this is second order polynomial of the A, you see.

362
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So second order polynomial of A.

363
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And of course you all know there's very famous rules that you can, that you're learning the secondary school.

364
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
A X squared plus B X plus C.

365
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So you can get a standard way, the quadratic equation and solve this A.

366
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Because typically second order, you will have two rules.

367
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
One is positive, one may be negative.

368
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
One is larger, one is smaller.

369
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Unless these two rules are the same.

370
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
But in our case here, it turns out to be one of them is positive, the other is negative.

371
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So we keep the, based on the assumption A should be positive, we keep this A greater than zero.

372
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So it will turn out to be, this is what we can solve.

373
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
So how to solve?

374
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Again, as I say, you can solve the second order quadratic equation of A.

375
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It should be not an issue.

376
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And now we want to see whether it's biased or not.

377
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:59,000
So this is, again, it's not a direct answer to, let me see.

378
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Okay, so now it works out.

379
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It's very interesting.

380
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Very interesting.

381
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Let me see.

382
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So I hope I keep this ongoing later.

383
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So now it will not suddenly go to, maybe I will call this problem.

384
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So now how to show this is biased.

385
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Because when you take expectation, if you are dealing with linear or even polynomial,

386
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:09,000
in terms of the random variable, where our random variable here is the data here.

387
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So you can, there are certain ways to break E into even second orders and so on.

388
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:26,000
But however, in this highly nonlinear case, square roots, the square roots of operation,

389
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
which I don't think there is an easy way.

390
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:38,000
You can say we know E of this x theta power of two.

391
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:55,000
But E of taking a square root of some random variable is basically probably no analytic solution you can apply.

392
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Because E is a linear operator.

393
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:13,000
So now the counter proof here is if we are not allowed to bring the E inside this nonlinear operation, the square root.

394
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:22,000
But on the other hand, we purposely apply this E inside.

395
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And then after that, it turns out to be if you apply this E inside this, and you take the square root,

396
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:46,000
then our E or not really E of this, then it turns out to be this whole thing becomes A.

397
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So since this is not working initially, I tried to use it.

398
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:59,000
But anyway, good guys said derivation in a short copy.

399
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Yeah, that's how the derivation you want to try out yourself.

400
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:23,000
So now this is inside the square root.

401
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:32,000
If you say E of this inside, then because this is constant, I can bring the E inside this.

402
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So this one is no problem.

403
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And then each of them we can use the very useful and famous formula.

404
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
If your tree is X of n, because each of them they are i.i.d.

405
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So they are basically the same.

406
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:00,000
So each of them you use the formula E of the random variable power of two.

407
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
It would be equal to E of the same random variable, as you remember, I mentioned a few times.

408
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
These two are different.

409
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
One is X power of two first, and take E.

410
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
This is E of this X n power of two.

411
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
But you must add the value of the same X of n.

412
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
So I replace this into that.

413
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And then still waiting for something, because each of them are the same.

414
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So now we know our random variable here.

415
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Assume the W is zero mean.

416
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
So the expectation of X n is equal to A.

417
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So your power, making A power of two here, A squared.

418
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And then for this example, the value of that is equal to A.

419
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So waiting inside, we will have this.

420
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And then now you sum all of them together.

421
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
There will be a total of A divided by A.

422
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
You will end up with this.

423
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And then now there is no summation, because this is all the same.

424
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So we end up with A squared plus A plus one plus four.

425
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And which is equal to A plus half raised to the power of two.

426
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
So this is the derivation.

427
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Inside this, you see.

428
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So remember, what we just do is assume I take E of this.

429
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It will no longer become random.

430
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It will be just equal to A plus one over two raised to the power of two.

431
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Then you take the square root, because what's inside is positive.

432
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So you can become minus one over two plus one over two plus A.

433
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And you cancel out the minus one over two and one over two.

434
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So therefore, if we are allowed to take the expectation breaking inside this,

435
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
then you get the unbiased estimate.

436
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
But since this operation is not allowed,

437
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
then what you do is wrong.

438
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So using this counter-prove approach, you show E of this is not equal to A.

439
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Because to be equal to A, you need to do an illegal operation,

440
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
which is not allowed.

441
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So something like you are not allowed to go into someone, your neighbors,

442
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
unless he or she allows you to.

443
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
If you know his permission, you go in.

444
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,000
If there is something wrong, you take out something which shouldn't be yours.

445
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So the argument is in this way.

446
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So in this way, except this is the way to show.

447
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Usually this one later, we also need this operation.

448
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So now, because this is non-linear,

449
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:37,000
then we have difficulty to see how good this MLE is.

450
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Because you can say, okay, I just yield this one,

451
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
since we are based on the major data.

452
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Whatever your end sample, we use this.

453
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But because this is highly non-linear,

454
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,000
we can see whether we can do something more meaningful.

455
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Say, for example, analyze the variant.

456
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
This is a very hard thing.

457
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Even with the difficulty to get the expectation, to get the variant,

458
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
it's almost impossible directly.

459
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So now, that's why for MLE, we are assuming you have a large number of data samples.

460
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
The following discussion is,

461
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:28,000
assume now we want to see if our samples increase or in the same,

462
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
go to infinity last.

463
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Are we able to get an approximation of this MLE,

464
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
which gives you some better expression?

465
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
So that's how we are going to do it.

466
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,000
We use this Taylor series expansion by expanding,

467
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
because this is a function of, you see here,

468
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
the only non-linear or depending on data is this.

469
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Here we go to this.

470
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And this is random, you see,

471
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
where I'm summing up the square, the major value raised to the power 2,

472
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,000
and then take the mean value out of this.

473
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So, assume we let u equal to that,

474
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:27,000
and then now this will be a function of this GU is non-linear.

475
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So our discussion here is,

476
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:39,000
we try to explain it around this EUG load,

477
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
EUG load value,

478
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
which is, you see, EU is random,

479
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
but we take the expectation,

480
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
you see, they become non-random.

481
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And the idea here is,

482
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
if you are averaging many random variables,

483
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
particularly i.i.d.,

484
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
then eventually when the sample to take average becomes larger and larger,

485
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
then eventually the random variable gradually reduces the value,

486
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
it will become no longer random.

487
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So that's a very typical famous large sample,

488
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
large data sample theory,

489
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
your approach to the mean value index.

490
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Then you can also see from the simulation,

491
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I showed you the sample is increased,

492
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:40,000
then eventually you will see it's very centralized around the true value index.

493
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
That's what we are doing here, you see,

494
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
because this EUG load is the angle to infinity large,

495
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
it will approach to this,

496
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
it will become E,

497
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:59,000
and then EU, which is equal to this A plus A squared.

498
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You can try to divide that, like I said.

499
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And then from there,

500
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
we can explain it because this is non-linear function,

501
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
using Taylor expansion at this EUG load,

502
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
and then that's a standard way.

503
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And after some derivation,

504
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
you will show this approximately using this,

505
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
you see, it's non-linear,

506
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
but approximately at the first order derivative,

507
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
then you end up with this.

508
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So that's more management, you see.

509
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So now we reduce non-linear one into,

510
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
it's a linear function of,

511
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
not the random variable itself, but the power of two.

512
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:51,000
But we all know we can handle random variables with the power of two much easier,

513
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
particularly for Gaussian, you see.

514
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
For Gaussian, as I already showed you,

515
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
there is not a normal problem.

516
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So this is what we approximate.

517
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Finally, we can see this ANOE by using another way.

518
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And it works well if n is very large

519
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
because our derivation is assumed, n is infinitely large.

520
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
But if we do not have infinitely large, if n is large enough,

521
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,000
so the error would be not that much.

522
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
So that's why I call it approximate.

523
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
And then now, again here, we can show from here,

524
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
if we are talking about this part,

525
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
then e of this part is just equal to a.

526
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
But since we had approximate here,

527
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
so we say approximately equal to a.

528
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And the value, so this looks very complicated.

529
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Value of this one is equal to that.

530
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So that part is not easy.

531
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
So perhaps I will leave this part for you.

532
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Maybe you go back and see how you can derive a.

533
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
This is not part of the assignment.

534
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,000
At least that's a very good derivation.

535
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And it turns out to be now this one is equal to our CLB.

536
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
You can see.

537
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So therefore, the MLE here is asymptotically unbiased,

538
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
asymptotically unique, n to be very large,

539
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
and also asymptotically efficient.

540
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
In this case, we achieved the CLB.

541
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
So this is the example, although it's like a tall example,

542
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:57,000
but quite a few concepts and quite some techniques together.

543
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
So I hope you are okay with that.

544
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Take your time to digest.

545
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
And as I say, try to derive it by yourself if possible.

546
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,000
So now we can extend it to, oh yeah,

547
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
before going to the vector parameter case,

548
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:25,000
we can also discuss the regularity conditions here.

549
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
It's quite similar to the case we are dealing with,

550
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
the CLB, feature information,

551
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
but here it's a little bit relaxed.

552
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
We only require the existence of the first order

553
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,000
and second order derivative of this log-like function.

554
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And also, no zero feature information

555
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
because these two conditions, if you do this CLB,

556
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
you also need that.

557
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
But then, yeah.

558
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,000
So if that's the case, we will also see,

559
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
but we are not going to prove here,

560
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
it's just called the result here.

561
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Then in this case, in the case of the data sample is large,

562
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:29,000
asymptotic mean you have infinity of the angle to very large,

563
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:35,000
you can see this will follow the Gaussian distribution, you see.

564
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
So that means that the mean, the Gaussian distribution,

565
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
the mean is just equal to our unknown parameter, theta, the true one.

566
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And the value is just equal to our feature information,

567
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,000
and take the inverse, that's the same as our CLB.

568
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So in this case, you can see it will be an efficient one

569
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
because it will approach the CLB.

570
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And then you can see the asymptotic behavior.

571
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
This is what I say here.

572
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
You will see here, if A is equal to one,

573
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,000
depending on how much sample you have to see.

574
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:29,000
So you see here, if you have the theoretical asymptotic period

575
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
of the data in the store game.

576
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
So you see here, the more data you have,

577
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,000
then you will be approximating the theoretical period.

578
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:47,000
But in the actual implementation, we don't need to refer to the period.

579
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
As long as you have enough data sample,

580
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,000
you can see it will follow the Gaussian distribution.

581
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And then we maybe finish this part and take a break.

582
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,000
We take the, extend it to the vector parameter case,

583
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:15,000
then you'll still get the period or view X is fixed.

584
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
You'll get the likelihood function.

585
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Remember, even though theta now is a vector,

586
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:29,000
our period is still a scalar function of the X and theta.

587
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
But when you take the derivative with respect to the theta vector,

588
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:43,000
you will get the derivative become a vector.

589
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
So you need to make the whole vector equal to zero

590
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,000
and then solve the maximum value, corresponding value.

591
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And again, you'll satisfy the regularity condition

592
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and then also now you'll need Fisher information magic.

593
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Then you can show, you will also follow this asymptotic distribution,

594
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:16,000
become like a Gaussian, which is unbiased and also meet the CRP.

595
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:27,000
So let's take a look at the example where we have two unknowns here.

596
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
So this is a typical example here,

597
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:38,000
where we have unknown of A, which is the mean, a PC value, N.

598
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Our WN is a zero mean, but the barrier is also unknown.

599
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Now this sigma power two, it's not the same example.

600
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It's an independent one, A and PC.

601
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So we put the two of them into an unknown parameter vector.

602
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:05,000
To do that, we apply the derivative to each of A and sigma power two.

603
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Sometimes you may confuse this sigma power two as sigma and then raise the power two.

604
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It's not. You treat that as just one unknown parameter.

605
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,000
So that's why in the assignments, I always suggest you put that as a new,

606
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
maybe call it M1, M2 and so on.

607
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Not to leave the power two here.

608
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
If you keep power two, you always need to remember

609
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:44,000
where our derivative is to the whole sigma power two.

610
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So you don't give the sigma power three here.

611
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
You will never have either sigma power two or sigma power four,

612
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
which is twice of sigma power two.

613
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Now the important one here on the input side,

614
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:10,000
because it's always the case if you are doing the assignment or the finding exam paper.

615
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
You want to solve two equations with two unknowns.

616
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Then typically you try to solve one first and then you solve the second one.

617
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
But you need to make sure when you solve the first one here,

618
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:32,000
you put the, for example, you already get one solution of A here.

619
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Because the first equation, you want to make it equal to zero.

620
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
You don't need to involve this sigma power two.

621
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,000
But to solve the second one, you must put the solution of A,

622
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
which is A hat, into this second equation.

623
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
This is always, every year I have a student probably,

624
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I hope those are attending the class since you will gain more attention.

625
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Other than those watching the video, they may not see my emphasis, my face here.

626
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:13,000
So I emphasize here, when you solve, so let me, let me highlight here, you see.

627
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
When you solve the first one, that's very easy.

628
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I, yeah, I will get the A estimate based on, yeah, just based on the sum of B.

629
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Because you want to make this equal to zero, we can ignore this one.

630
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
So what you solve is here.

631
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,000
And that's why the A hat is equal to just the sum for B.

632
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And then now to put this into the second one, you don't leave the A there.

633
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:54,000
You must use the solution of this A, which is the sum for B inside.

634
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,000
You have to get the second one, which is the, so this part is the,

635
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
this part is the estimate of the sigma power of two.

636
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Again, it's not sigma, it's sigma power of two, the value.

637
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And then, so again finally we want to link this with assuming

638
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:25,000
we're dealing with, again, the general linear models, which we discussed earlier.

639
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,000
But here we extend it a little bit by allowing the W.

640
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It's not necessarily Y.

641
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:43,000
It has zero mean, but the variance can be a covariant matrix,

642
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:51,000
which is, of course, must be invertible and also positive definite.

643
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
But it can have the off-diagonal element not being zero.

644
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
So in this case, you can also show the MLE.

645
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:10,000
In this case, it values Gaussian, so you will see it's equal to this expression.

646
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:19,000
So that's, because being Gaussian, sorry, this one is noise,

647
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:26,000
but our solution here will be this one.

648
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:35,000
This is the MLE for the unknown parameter vector here,

649
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:43,000
so if this is linear, then we can see this time the CLB and also the MLE.

650
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,000
And then therefore our PTF of this will be equal to this.

651
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:53,000
So this is very similar to what we did earlier.

652
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:01,000
So we finished this MLE.

653
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Thanks.

654
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:14,000
But you need to take time to digest and think about some of the derivations.

655
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I give you some time to go back.

656
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
We are doing the assignment.

657
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
You can try this, but if not, then it will be very difficult.

658
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I will show you because this document camera is not very stable here.

659
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
So any questions before we take a break and then move?

660
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Yes?

661
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Can we go to slide 19 and 19, 19, 19?

662
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
9-0.

663
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:03,000
So we have the input X, and it's kind of a sequence, right?

664
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
We can consider it as a sequence of inputs, right?

665
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
n is equal to 0, and n is equal to n minus 1.

666
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Yes, yes, yes.

667
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So for this distribution, shouldn't it be the multiplication of all of those ones?

668
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Oh, yes, yes. That's why you know the very famous result.

669
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Exponential function.

670
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:38,000
When you multiply two exponential functions of the same base, you are adding the exponent together.

671
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:45,000
So that's why you end up with your multiplication becomes the summation of the exponent.

672
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Because all the other parts are the same.

673
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Right?

674
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
So that's why we already dig early.

675
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
That's how we directly, directly apply.

676
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
It will become the, yeah, adding up the exponent.

677
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:08,000
So each of the, because here is a Gaussian, so each is exponential of, say, A.

678
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Then you multiply exponential B, then you multiply together, your B exponent is A plus B.

679
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
So in total, you have n.

680
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:26,000
You are summing up those, because all the exponents, they differ only by Xn and 0, 1, 2, 3.

681
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
So that's why you turn this into, yeah.

682
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Okay?

683
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,000
So I hope that this is something you always need to remember.

684
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And that's why, quite often, we use log.

685
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Because once you make it become exponential, you take log, you will bring this exponent down to become,

686
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
yeah, it will be easier to enter.

687
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Okay, good question.

688
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Any other thing?

689
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yes?

690
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
In this class 97, so just how about your alpha size?

691
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:16,000
After you calculate all the estimators of the first item of the parameter,

692
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Yes.

693
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
What do you mean by that?

694
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
For example, if I get A hat,

695
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Yes.

696
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Why calculate the second norm?

697
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Why let A equal to A hat?

698
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Yeah, you just put whatever the solution to solve.

699
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
This is a very common problem in math.

700
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
You are solving two equations with two unknowns.

701
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:49,000
So remember, even with the normal linear equation, you solve one.

702
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Because in this case, it happened to be the first equation.

703
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
You can see here, you make it equal to zero.

704
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
You will be basically just let this whole thing.

705
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Because this one is a no-zero coefficient.

706
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So you will be letting, summing up a total of A,

707
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
they become NA, and equal to summing up this equal to zero.

708
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Then you get the solution already for this.

709
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Then to solve the second one, you must put this one.

710
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Because you see the two solutions must be, you solve two equations simultaneously.

711
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:38,000
This is a very common technique in EBO.

712
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Just think about two equations, x plus y equal to 2,

713
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:54,000
then the second one is 3x plus 2y equal to 5.

714
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Then to solve that, there must be only two fixed values for linear equations.

715
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Usually you just have a unique solution.

716
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
So you get one solving from the first equation,

717
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,000
then you substitute into the second one to solve the other variable.

718
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
That's the same here, although this looks a little bit more complicated

719
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,000
because those coefficients are summation of the data sample.

720
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Sometime later you will see it can become a nonlinear function

721
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
or polynomial of the data.

722
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
But the idea is the same.

723
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
You must solve both of them simultaneously.

724
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:38,000
You solve one, then you use the solution you put into the second one to solve the other.

725
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Because in this case, the second one, you involve both A and sigma power 2.

726
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I hope this is the case.

727
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Later I deliver probably one of the assignment questions either here

728
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
or here.

729
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Normally we will not involve more than two unknown parameters,

730
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:18,000
but you will need to know how to solve two equations for two unknowns.

731
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,000
So you do it simultaneously.

732
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,000
We take a break here, then we can continue after that.

733
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So now we come back at 8 p.m.

734
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Now it's 7.44.

735
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Now we come back at 8 p.m.

736
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Now we come back at 8 p.m.

737
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Now we come back at 8 p.m.

738
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Now we come back at 8 p.m.

739
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Can you tell us a little bit more about this experiment?

740
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Yes.

741
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
The experiment was done in the late 19th century.

742
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:08,000
The experiment was done in the late 19th century.

743
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
The experiment was done in the early 19th century.

744
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
The experiment was done in the early 19th century.

745
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
The experiment was done in the early 19th century.

746
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
The experiment was done in the early 19th century.

747
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:29,000
This experiment was conducted in the early 17th century.

748
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
This experiment was done in the early 19th century.

749
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,520
So I say settled in this�

750
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
the experiment was done here.

751
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I think it was a very interesting experiment.

752
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And keep in mind that this experiment has numerous characteristics.

753
01:17:51,000 --> 01:18:07,800
news

754
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:16,600
just think about it I didn't see anything

755
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,780
So you, please.

756
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:21,780
You can take this.

757
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:27,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

758
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:33,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

759
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:37,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

760
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:41,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

761
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:47,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

762
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:51,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

763
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:55,780

798

I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

799
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:37,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

800
01:28:37,780 --> 01:29:01,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

801
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:25,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

802
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:49,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

803
01:29:49,780 --> 01:30:13,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

804
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:37,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

805
01:30:37,780 --> 01:31:01,780
I would like to thank all of the undergraduates for their support.

806
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:11,780
Before going to the lecture notes, let me explain briefly the assignment.

807
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:21,780
As I already announced early, for this course we have two CA.

808
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:33,780
The first one is the estimation theory.

809
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:37,780
I already uploaded this at NTU.

810
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:43,780
You go inside 7402, go to the assignment.

811
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:47,780
It's not in the contact, but you click the assignment one.

812
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:53,780
You should be able to download this PDF.

813
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:57,780
I give all the explanation here.

814
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:01,780
You have three weeks.

815
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:09,780
Now it's week five, which is up to recess week, the same Wednesday, quite a long time.

816
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:13,780
You will be by 12, midnight.

817
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:17,780
It's typically the case.

818
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:23,780
Nowadays you can use chat GPT, but try to do it by yourself.

819
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:27,780
Because mostly here you're solving equations.

820
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:31,780
So I guess chat GPT may not have that much.

821
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:41,780
Except, of course, the last question, A, you will have more math.

822
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:45,780
You can do the three options.

823
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:53,780
You can choose two of them which will be more comfortable.

824
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:59,780
Show all the steps involved in detail.

825
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:09,780
The first seven questions are quite similar to the final exam paper questions.

826
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:19,780
They cover most of the containing power, including rules, MLEs and so on.

827
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:25,780
And later these square linear models.

828
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:38,780
The last two questions are more related to the Bayesian one, which you can leave until next week.

829
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:46,780
I will go through the final chapter of this part.

830
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:55,780
Question A is, I give three sub-questions, so you can choose two.

831
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:57,780
You don't need to choose three.

832
01:33:57,780 --> 01:34:00,780
Just choose any two of them.

833
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:05,780
Make it clear.

834
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:13,780
So again, describe if you have some research problem, even now or previously,

835
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:18,780
or being in your undergraduate projects or whatever.

836
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:24,780
Should be related to parameter estimation problem.

837
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:26,780
Like a small project.

838
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:37,780
And then you can also do some implementation using Python or whatever.

839
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:42,780
I think most of the students can work out this one.

840
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:54,780
And the last option is I attach a research paper where some parts are related to parameter estimation.

841
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:57,780
So this one is also open-ended.

842
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:10,780
You read it and then try your best to figure out what this paper is doing and what's related to.

843
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:19,780
It's not totally within the contents of the part.

844
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:24,780
Being a research paper, usually you cover some related topics.

845
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:37,780
So you maybe look to get some understanding if you are interested in exploring more.

846
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:47,780
And that also shows how you can relate the way you learn here to some machine learning areas.

847
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:56,780
Because signal processing and machine learning are some parts closely related.

848
01:35:56,780 --> 01:36:01,780
Any questions, you can let me know.

849
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:06,780
Maybe I'll make an announcement again for you to learn.

850
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:14,780
Because some students are not here.

851
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:22,780
But before we move on to the next chapter, which is the least squares.

852
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:30,780
Any questions you would like to raise for the previous chapter?

853
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:38,780
Because this is supposed to be the last one in this conventional parameter estimation.

854
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:44,780
And I think this square is also a relatively easy concept.

855
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:52,780
Particularly what we are doing here is mostly also assume linear models.

856
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:56,780
No linear one, you will use a similar approach.

857
01:36:56,780 --> 01:37:04,780
But typically one may need to do by computer implementations.

858
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:12,780
So let's start here.

859
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:25,780
And the method of least squares here is again another way of doing parameter estimation.

860
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:32,780
So you will see the different methods.

861
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:36,780
In the end we are still trying to see what we can do.

862
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:47,780
So remember the assumption here is we have a finite number of typically capital N major data.

863
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:54,780
And we want to see how to make good use of these given finite number of data samples.

864
01:37:54,780 --> 01:38:02,780
It's based on certain assumptions, either PDF or some second order statistic or some models.

865
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:08,780
We are going to estimate the parameter hidden in this data.

866
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:15,780
And moving on to part two, detection, signal detection.

867
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:16,780
It's also similar.

868
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:20,780
We are doing the signal detection.

869
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:24,780
And also based on finite number of data samples.

870
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:29,780
And so you see here all these methods in the end are non-parameter.

871
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:35,780
Our estimate is a function of the major data.

872
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:41,780
Except the CILB, where for CILB we are taking the expectation.

873
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:47,780
So in the end the end-out is not a function of data.

874
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:48,780
And that also varies.

875
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:53,780
The CILB is a benchmark for any estimator.

876
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:55,780
So it's independent of the data.

877
01:38:55,780 --> 01:39:08,780
Other than that, all the other estimates in the end we also express it as a function of how to combine the data in a simple way.

878
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:18,780
So again here, the least square here is we do not make any probabilistic assumption on the data.

879
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:24,780
But we assume some signal models.

880
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:40,780
And then based on that and the major data, we try to derive the best from using the criteria of least square.

881
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:58,780
So here we cannot have the results showing any statistical best performance and so on.

882
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:11,780
Because we are not having the PDA assumption or even not deriving it from the statistical point of view.

883
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:16,780
We are more based on the major data itself.

884
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:22,780
So it's simple, easier to do.

885
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:27,780
But then again there is some limitation.

886
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:31,780
It's always pros and cons.

887
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:36,780
But this one, least square, as I said, is very popular.

888
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:46,780
Quite often you do it in practice because you can also handle no linear least square.

889
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:56,780
But you may not be able to solve it analytically as we will be doing here for the linear models.

890
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:04,780
So actually the model itself here is not necessarily linear.

891
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:18,780
But it should be as a function of describing the data sample index and the unknown parameter.

892
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:26,780
Say for example you put it as a side way function or exponential function.

893
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:42,780
And then based on that you can try to apply the least square approach to do the optimization.

894
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:47,780
So how to do that?

895
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:56,780
We had a sample of data which is in this way.

896
01:41:56,780 --> 01:42:06,780
And then now we are measuring this major data as certain models.

897
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:12,780
Here our model is different from the early model.

898
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:21,780
For example we have the linear models and so on where we need to assume certain noise inside.

899
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:33,780
Even if you do not appear there, we still say we are using the second order statistic of the noise.

900
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:39,780
Same mean, value, or value. Even so we may not know the whole period.

901
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:45,780
But here it differs in the case of our model here.

902
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:55,780
It's just describing the so-called signal.

903
01:42:55,780 --> 01:43:00,780
So we do not directly embed the noise here.

904
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:11,780
What happens to the noise? Noise is somehow inside the major data.

905
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:25,780
And then using the model and the major data we want to see how good this model fits into the major data.

906
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:30,780
So we take a difference for each intake.

907
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:33,780
The n goes to zero with one major data.

908
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:39,780
This model is also depending on the intake as you will see.

909
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,780
It's both a function of the zeta.

910
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:48,780
Otherwise you will not be able to estimate the unknown parameter.

911
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:51,780
And then typically they are not the same.

912
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:58,780
But we want to see how to minimize the least square.

913
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:10,780
This is the square sum of the square because we increase the power of two.

914
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:19,780
And here it's quite useful because we do not assume the Gaussian.

915
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:23,780
It could be Gaussian or it could be no Gaussian noise.

916
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:40,780
Then the performance of this is depending on the property of this noise into this major data.

917
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:44,780
And also the modeling errors.

918
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:56,780
As I said, here you have to somehow guess what this major data are more likely following certain signal model.

919
01:44:56,780 --> 01:45:01,780
Linear or sideways or exponential and so on.

920
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:09,780
So we start with, again, the simple case.

921
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:18,780
Scalar parameter and also the signal model here as you can see is similar to what we described earlier.

922
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:21,780
It's a linear model.

923
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:27,780
But the difference here is our model doesn't include the noise.

924
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:30,780
So assuming there's no noise here.

925
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:40,780
And then the coefficient here is assumed to be a known sequence.

926
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:42,780
Not necessarily constant.

927
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:45,780
It's a function of A.

928
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:47,780
But it's deterministic.

929
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:49,780
It's not random here.

930
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:51,780
So our model here is deterministic.

931
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:59,780
What being random or statistically it would be this major data.

932
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:12,780
So using this least square error criterion, we already do is take each of the difference and then we start to sum them together.

933
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:23,780
And then to minimize, as we already know, you just take this function of the data.

934
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:30,780
You take first of the derivative and then make it equal to zero.

935
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:33,780
Which is similar to the MLE.

936
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:38,780
So you can see here.

937
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:40,780
Very easy.

938
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:44,780
This one is second order polynomial of theta.

939
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:46,780
You take derivative.

940
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:49,780
You will be two of this.

941
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:56,780
And then, of course, you treat this h of n as a coefficient of theta.

942
01:46:56,780 --> 01:47:01,780
So you end up with putting h of n here.

943
01:47:01,780 --> 01:47:03,780
Then you're likely equal to zero.

944
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:07,780
So you're bringing it into two terms.

945
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:10,780
Of course, the summation is still there.

946
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:16,780
So one common mistake, for example, you take the derivative of h of n here.

947
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:23,780
Then, Cloud Fung students will try to move this one outside and get a simpler solution.

948
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:25,780
Which is wrong.

949
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:33,780
Because the summation, whatever inside this summation, depending on the index, you cannot take out.

950
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:36,780
So that's a very so-called golden rule.

951
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:41,780
And that happens in solving assignment questions.

952
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:47,780
So I want to just remind you of this.

953
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:50,780
And that's why you end up with h of n here.

954
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:52,780
So you multiply x of n.

955
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:54,780
You end up with this one of the terms here.

956
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:56,780
And the other, h of n.

957
01:47:56,780 --> 01:47:59,780
Multiply h of n, become h of n power two.

958
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:02,780
But for the theta, you can take out.

959
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:09,780
Because theta is independent of h.

960
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:13,780
But inside the power of two, you cannot take it out.

961
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:15,780
Because it's a second order.

962
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:19,780
But once you take the derivative, you will become a linear function of theta.

963
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:21,780
So you can take out.

964
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:26,780
Therefore, this is the solution.

965
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:28,780
Make it equal to zero.

966
01:48:28,780 --> 01:48:32,780
That's what we call minimize the error.

967
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:35,780
You get this.

968
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:42,780
And then, once you get the solution, you want to get the corresponding error.

969
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:44,780
So you pay attention here.

970
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:48,780
This theta is before we do the optimization.

971
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:50,780
It's a function of theta.

972
01:48:50,780 --> 01:48:52,780
It's general.

973
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:54,780
Depending on which theta you are going to take.

974
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:58,780
Now once you get the optimal theta hat here.

975
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:02,780
Or at least optimal in terms of least square.

976
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:08,780
Minimal least square error.

977
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:10,780
So we need to put this one in.

978
01:49:10,780 --> 01:49:14,780
Then you substitute this whole thing inside here.

979
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:16,780
You will see the hat here.

980
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:19,780
But then, you either keep this formula here.

981
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:20,780
It's okay.

982
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:22,780
Or you explain it.

983
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:24,780
I think it's better in this way.

984
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:29,780
Because from here, you can see this term is always positive.

985
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:32,780
So you will see this least square error.

986
01:49:32,780 --> 01:49:36,780
After you get the optimal one, it's always smaller.

987
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:38,780
Like most equal to this.

988
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:43,780
So this is our measured data's energy.

989
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:47,780
Any data sample will raise out to add together.

990
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:56,780
So therefore you can see here.

991
01:49:56,780 --> 01:50:01,780
The relationship is always greater or equal to zero.

992
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:08,780
Because you are taking the square of the difference.

993
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:12,780
So it's always at least equal to zero.

994
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:15,780
But smaller than this.

995
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:17,780
Or at most equal to this part.

996
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:23,780
Which is the original energy of the data.

997
01:50:23,780 --> 01:50:29,780
So that looks quite easy for the scale case.

998
01:50:29,780 --> 01:50:34,780
So let's look at the simple example again.

999
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:35,780
Here, easy level.

1000
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:41,780
So here you see the difference from the previous chapter.

1001
01:50:41,780 --> 01:50:47,780
The other measure is our signal model is just purely trying to guess.

1002
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:52,780
What if no noise, how the signal looks like.

1003
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:56,780
Because easy level signal is a constant.

1004
01:50:56,780 --> 01:51:01,780
And that's how we do not take noise into the clouds here.

1005
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:03,780
In the signal model.

1006
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:09,780
But the noise is part of the observations or measured data.

1007
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:13,780
So then we know this error.

1008
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:15,780
Even by this.

1009
01:51:15,780 --> 01:51:19,780
And then again just based on all you can derive here.

1010
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:22,780
Or use the result we just showed.

1011
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:26,780
You will see the solution is the sample being here.

1012
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:30,780
And then once you get the sample being you're trying to get this.

1013
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:35,780
So it's quite easy for the scale case.

1014
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:40,780
Particularly if you are dealing with assuming linear model.

1015
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:45,780
Then we are getting back to what we learned earlier.

1016
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:51,780
It's just from another angle.

1017
01:51:51,780 --> 01:52:01,780
Then we can move on to linear least square for vector parameter case.

1018
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:09,780
As I say the approach can be extended to non-linear.

1019
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:14,780
Solving non-linear equation.

1020
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:18,780
Particularly if you have a set of equations.

1021
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:22,780
Typically you may not get analytic solution.

1022
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:27,780
You may do it by numerical approach.

1023
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:31,780
Or sometimes some of the polynomial.

1024
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:34,780
If it's a polynomial equation.

1025
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:38,780
Then there is some quite powerful next tools.

1026
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:42,780
You call it global basis.

1027
01:52:42,780 --> 01:52:46,780
Which is quite good idea.

1028
01:52:46,780 --> 01:52:49,780
I used that for research for some years.

1029
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:54,780
I always encourage students to try it.

1030
01:52:54,780 --> 01:53:02,780
If you are solving a system of polynomial equations.

1031
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:07,780
For those who really need that.

1032
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:10,780
You can approach me individually.

1033
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:13,780
But not in this course.

1034
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:18,780
So let's look at how we are solving this.

1035
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:20,780
Vector parameter.

1036
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:24,780
We are using the linear models.

1037
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:28,780
Again the model here we don't take noise into consideration.

1038
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:36,780
Just saying the model is a linear function of the unknown parameter vector.

1039
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:41,780
So we need to...

1040
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:44,780
Where this coefficient is a known one.

1041
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:48,780
Again here is N by P observation.

1042
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:52,780
So you see here it's of full length P.

1043
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:57,780
As we assume P is greater or at least equal to P.

1044
01:53:57,780 --> 01:54:05,780
And then LSE is obtained by...

1045
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:13,780
Very similar to what we did earlier for the linear model.

1046
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:18,780
So here you also see how to solve your explaining to several terms.

1047
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:23,780
Then use the vector derivation to get this.

1048
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:25,780
And then make it equal to zero.

1049
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:29,780
So you get this solution equal to this.

1050
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:37,780
So that's the same as what we obtained earlier.

1051
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:39,780
From another angle.

1052
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:49,780
Because we are not assuming Gaussian.

1053
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:54,780
So turn out these equations.

1054
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:56,780
Normal equation.

1055
01:54:56,780 --> 01:55:04,780
So that's identical to what we did earlier using the rule approach.

1056
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:13,780
But in the rules, if you recall, we are assuming this assumption here.

1057
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:23,780
Then also the covariance of the data equal to IID here.

1058
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:33,780
But for LSE, so far we do not assume this conditional noise.

1059
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:40,780
And also the minimum error is given by that.

1060
01:55:40,780 --> 01:55:49,780
So now once we get this theta hat, theta hat is here, you can put it in.

1061
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:53,780
So this is the one without simplification.

1062
01:55:54,780 --> 01:56:11,780
Then there are two ways you can somehow simplify into either this.

1063
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:21,780
So that means the theta hat here we already obtained as a function of h and theta.

1064
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:31,780
So either this or even another way simpler one.

1065
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:41,780
Because if you compare this one with this one, part of it is gone.

1066
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:47,780
How to do that?

1067
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:59,780
You make good use of the orthogonality property by making good use of theta hat.

1068
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:05,780
Our theta hat is special. Theta hat must satisfy this.

1069
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:11,780
This one works only for the theta hat.

1070
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:18,780
If you put the general theta, of course you will not be able to show from here to here.

1071
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:24,780
This is, as you can observe, this is only part of that.

1072
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:28,780
In general, they are not the same.

1073
01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:33,780
Just imagine you put the transpose into each of the term here.

1074
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:37,780
The first one, h transpose, it will give you this.

1075
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:45,780
The other one is, remember you take transpose of the product of two matrix, you have to swap this.

1076
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:52,780
Theta hat transpose, and then h transpose, and then multiply by that.

1077
01:57:52,780 --> 01:58:01,780
So it turns out to be that one is equal to zero because of the special property of theta hat.

1078
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:07,780
Again, this involves a little bit of matrix operation.

1079
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:13,780
I hope you maybe try to do it.

1080
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:19,780
If not, I will explain next time.

1081
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:24,780
Then we can extend the weighted least square.

1082
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:33,780
The weighting here is, this one is the weighting matrix.

1083
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:37,780
It's positive, definite.

1084
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:46,780
The idea here is we are handling noises where certain data samples are more important.

1085
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:51,780
We are doing the weighting.

1086
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:58,780
It turns out to be quite useful in some practical applications.

1087
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:02,780
That's how we call it, weighted least squares.

1088
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:07,780
You're adding in this W in the middle.

1089
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:11,780
The LAS error criteria is the same as before.

1090
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:17,780
You make W equal to, I think, identity matrix.

1091
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:21,780
Again, you use some algebraic.

1092
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:27,780
You can divide the solution, as you see, with the weighting just equal to this.

1093
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:32,780
You're adding this W in the middle.

1094
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:39,780
From here, you can also see, in terms of the data, you will be weighting all the data.

1095
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:53,780
Then, once you get this, you get the minimum LAS error by substituting inside.

1096
01:59:53,780 --> 01:59:57,780
You can explain it.

1097
01:59:57,780 --> 02:00:08,780
Probably, we may no longer be able to show it into that simple form.

1098
02:00:08,780 --> 02:00:13,780
Like this, I don't see the simple form like that.

1099
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:15,780
Maybe I can try.

1100
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:23,780
I try myself since I'm not able to do it.

1101
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:33,780
Any questions before we move on to the other one?

1102
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:48,780
I think I will skip this sequential least squares until the end of part 1 and part 2.

1103
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:55,780
For this course, our second assignment is a quiz.

1104
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:58,780
It will be weight 11, not weight 12.

1105
02:00:58,780 --> 02:01:08,780
After weight 11, we still have time to do some additional lectures,

1106
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:19,780
which is the Kalman filter plus sequential least squares.

1107
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:25,780
I will skip this part first because that's quite related.

1108
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:35,780
I think now start this Bayesian estimation because this chapter...

1109
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:39,780
Actually, there are two chapters on that.

1110
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:45,780
Probably, it may take more than one week to learn.

1111
02:01:46,780 --> 02:01:52,780
Now to start this, at least you have some basic concept.

1112
02:01:52,780 --> 02:02:01,780
Maybe go back, you can try to digest.

1113
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:08,780
Any questions before we move on to that?

1114
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:15,780
Some previous chapters also.

1115
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:32,780
Because I think this chapter 8 and 9 dealing with Bayesian approach,

1116
02:02:32,780 --> 02:02:40,780
which at least in theory will be much more difficult

1117
02:02:40,780 --> 02:02:47,780
because we are now moving away from the assumption

1118
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:51,780
where the unknown parameters are deterministic.

1119
02:02:51,780 --> 02:03:08,780
You can imagine here at least we need to deal with at least two unknown random variables.

1120
02:03:08,780 --> 02:03:12,780
One is unknown parameter, the other is the random noise.

1121
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:18,780
So you need to try to get used to how to handle this thing.

1122
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:26,780
One very important tool, which is what we call the Bayesian Theorem.

1123
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:29,780
That's very powerful.

1124
02:03:29,780 --> 02:03:33,780
You can see, even in the machine learning area,

1125
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:38,780
some of the benchmark methods always compare with that.

1126
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:46,780
Don't I call it naive, Bayesian approach, but I think it's still quite powerful.

1127
02:03:46,780 --> 02:03:54,780
Some researchers argue that you ought to learn machine learning,

1128
02:03:54,780 --> 02:03:58,780
you must be learning this Bayesian Theorem.

1129
02:03:58,780 --> 02:04:08,780
That's the fundamentals of whatever machine learning methods, topics need to learn.

1130
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:16,780
As I say, we try to now move to the new area

1131
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:25,780
where we are also dealing with parameters which are random variables.

1132
02:04:26,780 --> 02:04:31,780
And then see how much we can do here.

1133
02:04:31,780 --> 02:04:36,780
And sometimes you can, even by learning this approach,

1134
02:04:36,780 --> 02:04:44,780
you can even apply it to the case where the unknown parameters are deterministic

1135
02:04:44,780 --> 02:04:49,780
because deterministic parameters are the same.

1136
02:04:49,780 --> 02:04:57,780
You can consider that as a special case of the random unknown parameter

1137
02:04:57,780 --> 02:05:04,780
by making the distribution to be a uniform distribution.

1138
02:05:04,780 --> 02:05:13,780
But the area for this uniform distribution, you need to assume you have the finite interval

1139
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:22,780
where the probability within this interval will be equal, one over the interval.

1140
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:26,780
But if you're assuming the interval is getting bigger and bigger,

1141
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:33,780
that's the case where you have a deterministic, because it's no longer random.

1142
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:39,780
Just imagine if the random variable takes all the possible values equally,

1143
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:45,780
they become no random variable.

1144
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:55,780
That's how those people arguing this Bayesian estimation is more general.

1145
02:05:55,780 --> 02:06:01,780
But we'll see how we can apply it here.

1146
02:06:02,780 --> 02:06:30,780
So, to start with, we are now looking at the observation and the unknown parameters.

1147
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:34,780
We see here both are random.

1148
02:06:34,780 --> 02:06:45,780
And then we still try to estimate the unknown parameters based on the major data.

1149
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:55,780
And then here we start by assuming we have the joy distribution

1150
02:06:55,780 --> 02:07:04,780
of the PDF of two random variables, X, which could be a vector,

1151
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:10,780
theta here could be also a vector.

1152
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:20,780
And then, for this, you should know the Bayes' Theorem, which is very useful.

1153
02:07:20,780 --> 02:07:30,780
It says this joy PDF, you can consider that as a product by...

1154
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:34,780
Put it here as a conditional PDF.

1155
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:43,780
This is a PDF of X, if you build this X conditioning on the given theta.

1156
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:52,780
So, as you see here, now what I always argue early,

1157
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:57,780
when we say we take the expectation of a random variable,

1158
02:07:57,780 --> 02:07:59,780
you become deterministic.

1159
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:06,780
It is no longer very here, because if you have two random variables,

1160
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:11,780
you may take the expectation of one of them, then you still have some randomness.

1161
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:19,780
So, here is the case of conditional PDF.

1162
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:24,780
In this case, we are given theta.

1163
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:30,780
Theta now is a random, so you have different realizations.

1164
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:39,780
You can take, say, you throw a coin, it can be, say, 0 or 1,

1165
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:46,780
or you throw a dice, six face, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.

1166
02:08:46,780 --> 02:08:52,780
So, this condition is assumed this theta has some realizations,

1167
02:08:52,780 --> 02:09:01,780
some random, but then we measure how the X is a random variable,

1168
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:03,780
still random.

1169
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:09,780
So, we can use the conditional PDF to measure this X, given theta.

1170
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:20,780
Or, alternatively, as we do other rounds, given the measured theta,

1171
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:23,780
you do some realizations, like what we learned earlier,

1172
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:25,780
like a little function.

1173
02:09:25,780 --> 02:09:31,780
Your X is random, but we take some fixed value, some realizations.

1174
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:32,780
There is no random.

1175
02:09:32,780 --> 02:09:36,780
But then, now our theta is still random, you see.

1176
02:09:36,780 --> 02:09:41,780
So, we still need to describe, assume, the conditional PDF,

1177
02:09:41,780 --> 02:09:43,780
the PDF of theta, given that.

1178
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:46,780
So, that's how this is going.

1179
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:51,780
What happens to both P of theta or P of X?

1180
02:09:51,780 --> 02:09:57,780
So, this is what we call prime PDF of theta,

1181
02:09:57,780 --> 02:10:01,780
because our theta now is a random variable.

1182
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:09,780
So, before we measure the data, we may have some knowledge of this,

1183
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:11,780
you know, the random variable.

1184
02:10:11,780 --> 02:10:14,780
For example, it could be a Gaussian distribution,

1185
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:17,780
or it's a uniform distribution, or some other form.

1186
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:20,780
But that knowledge is broader.

1187
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:25,780
So, some students keep asking, or ask, need a question.

1188
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:31,780
If we already have the PDF of theta, then why do we still need to use

1189
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:37,780
the measured data to do the posterior PDF?

1190
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:41,780
So, this is what we call posterior PDF, because this is the one

1191
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:43,780
after your measured data.

1192
02:10:43,780 --> 02:10:47,780
Then, you can interpret it this way.

1193
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:54,780
Before we measure the data, we may have a lot of broad knowledge

1194
02:10:54,780 --> 02:10:57,780
about the distribution of this random variable.

1195
02:10:57,780 --> 02:11:00,780
But we're not going to measure it.

1196
02:11:00,780 --> 02:11:02,780
Once we measure the data, we can measure the data.

1197
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:06,780
At least we assume it contains some useful information.

1198
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:12,780
They can narrow down our knowledge about this data.

1199
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:17,780
That will give you a better, more accurate representation

1200
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:23,780
of the unknown parameter, just like machine learning.

1201
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:29,780
You see, even before you measure data, quite often you may have

1202
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:39,780
some broad idea about maybe the class we're looking at

1203
02:11:39,780 --> 02:11:41,780
and belonging to what.

1204
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:43,780
But that's not enough.

1205
02:11:43,780 --> 02:11:48,780
Once you have the training data, or you learn from what your knowledge is,

1206
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:51,780
then you'll get a better understanding.

1207
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:58,780
Maybe you can improve what your previous knowledge is,

1208
02:11:58,780 --> 02:12:00,780
get it more accurate.

1209
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:09,780
So, similar here, this is the prior PDF before we even have the data.

1210
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:11,780
Then this is the posterior.

1211
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:15,780
So our idea is how to make good use of the data

1212
02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:26,780
and using this Bayes Theorem to improve, to get the posterior PDF,

1213
02:12:26,780 --> 02:12:29,780
having the measured data.

1214
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:33,780
So that's the main idea here.

1215
02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:38,780
Because now we are dealing with the unknown parameter,

1216
02:12:38,780 --> 02:12:40,780
except random variables.

1217
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:47,780
So we need to define some risk functions

1218
02:12:47,780 --> 02:12:53,780
to see how much different from...

1219
02:12:53,780 --> 02:12:55,780
Yeah, both of them are random.

1220
02:12:55,780 --> 02:13:00,780
We make it easier to look at the scale case.

1221
02:13:01,780 --> 02:13:08,780
So these measures, the estimate and the true one,

1222
02:13:08,780 --> 02:13:10,780
how much different.

1223
02:13:10,780 --> 02:13:13,780
But then, of course, you may argue again here,

1224
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:19,780
because being random is not a fixed value.

1225
02:13:19,780 --> 02:13:23,780
So our criteria here, the risk function,

1226
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:29,780
is just think about in terms of the random variable,

1227
02:13:29,780 --> 02:13:42,780
how you see the difference.

1228
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:49,780
Later, when you put this into the expectation, for example,

1229
02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:53,780
or the integration.

1230
02:13:53,780 --> 02:14:00,780
So that's how we try to define the difference

1231
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:06,780
from the true one and the estimate one.

1232
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:10,780
But later you will see these risk functions,

1233
02:14:10,780 --> 02:14:17,780
not the deterministic comparison by itself.

1234
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:22,780
Later we need to interpret that in the statistical sense.

1235
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:29,780
So for the moment, we look at the difference

1236
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:34,780
by using three very popular risk functions.

1237
02:14:34,780 --> 02:14:40,780
One is quadratic errors, which is co-open errors,

1238
02:14:40,780 --> 02:14:43,780
which means the difference with power of two.

1239
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:46,780
And the second one is absolute error,

1240
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:48,780
which is here graphically,

1241
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:51,780
which is take the absolute error.

1242
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:55,780
So all these risk functions must be positive,

1243
02:14:55,780 --> 02:14:58,780
or at least greater or equal to zero, to make sense.

1244
02:14:58,780 --> 02:15:01,780
So the difference itself may be positive, negative,

1245
02:15:01,780 --> 02:15:04,780
but we take absolute value.

1246
02:15:04,780 --> 02:15:07,780
And this one is also interesting,

1247
02:15:07,780 --> 02:15:14,780
because if the error is small enough,

1248
02:15:14,780 --> 02:15:19,780
so within the given delta, then we consider just zero.

1249
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:22,780
So we consider no error.

1250
02:15:22,780 --> 02:15:25,780
But greater than that, then we give the same,

1251
02:15:25,780 --> 02:15:27,780
all of them equal to one.

1252
02:15:27,780 --> 02:15:32,780
So these are the three popular criteria.

1253
02:15:32,780 --> 02:15:34,780
But it turns out this one is not easy to apply.

1254
02:15:34,780 --> 02:15:40,780
So our validation, our estimation method

1255
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:43,780
was based on either this one or this one,

1256
02:15:44,780 --> 02:15:49,780
to get some useful estimate.

1257
02:15:52,780 --> 02:15:53,780
Okay, so yeah.

1258
02:15:53,780 --> 02:15:57,780
So quadratic cost function, this is commonly used

1259
02:15:57,780 --> 02:16:02,780
because it's easy, it's just like the least square.

1260
02:16:02,780 --> 02:16:04,780
You have analytic function,

1261
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:09,780
so it's easier to derive analytic, basically.

1262
02:16:10,780 --> 02:16:14,780
So therefore, here, as I say,

1263
02:16:14,780 --> 02:16:17,780
we are dealing with random variables.

1264
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:21,780
So whenever given the observation,

1265
02:16:21,780 --> 02:16:26,780
then we need to take the average cost associated

1266
02:16:26,780 --> 02:16:31,780
with the selection of a set of estimates.

1267
02:16:31,780 --> 02:16:35,780
This is one, based on the major data you estimate.

1268
02:16:35,780 --> 02:16:40,780
And then you need to see how good this is.

1269
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:44,780
So now this is random,

1270
02:16:44,780 --> 02:16:49,780
so you need to take the average mean here,

1271
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:51,780
assuming continuous random variables,

1272
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:54,780
so you take the integration.

1273
02:16:54,780 --> 02:16:58,780
And you see here, given the observation,

1274
02:16:58,780 --> 02:17:01,780
so we're looking at this condition period,

1275
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:05,780
it's more like the weighting, you see.

1276
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:09,780
We want to see in total how much different,

1277
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:13,780
but by putting the weighting here,

1278
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:16,780
given things, now we have the observation.

1279
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:21,780
So we add this as a weighting to see,

1280
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:24,780
we integrate theta over, say,

1281
02:17:24,780 --> 02:17:27,780
the scale case over a certain weight.

1282
02:17:27,780 --> 02:17:30,780
So we'll see which one is more important,

1283
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:35,780
so we see it's more likely to be near the means,

1284
02:17:35,780 --> 02:17:37,780
then it's more likely to enter,

1285
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:45,780
where the other one will be a smaller value.

1286
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:50,780
And then, now we can also measure the total average

1287
02:17:50,780 --> 02:17:56,780
of the various rates by averaging the cost function

1288
02:17:56,780 --> 02:18:01,780
of all the possible X and theta.

1289
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:07,780
Here, we are thinking about we put the observation first,

1290
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:10,780
then we only need to deal with theta.

1291
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:15,780
But now, if we are taking for all the possible major data,

1292
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:22,780
say, in the X space, and also for theta,

1293
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:26,780
then, of course, your integration will be double integration

1294
02:18:26,780 --> 02:18:31,780
of both theta and the unknown random parameter.

1295
02:18:31,780 --> 02:18:34,780
So this is, you see, needed to take,

1296
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:38,780
except this is more comprehensive.

1297
02:18:38,780 --> 02:18:42,780
You cover all the possible X also.

1298
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:49,780
Then, so this is where the Bayesian can be in the prior, see.

1299
02:18:49,780 --> 02:18:53,780
This is the joy period, because you have both of them.

1300
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:58,780
So we substitute this into this formula.

1301
02:18:58,780 --> 02:19:04,780
And then, after that, you can put the total integration,

1302
02:19:04,780 --> 02:19:09,780
that each integration, if X, you can get many,

1303
02:19:09,780 --> 02:19:11,780
depending on how many data you have,

1304
02:19:11,780 --> 02:19:16,780
and in theory, in practice, you need to integrate n times

1305
02:19:16,780 --> 02:19:21,780
at each of the random variables over a certain range.

1306
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:25,780
So we put all of them just into one, both ways.

1307
02:19:25,780 --> 02:19:29,780
Similarly, for theta, if it's more than one parameter,

1308
02:19:29,780 --> 02:19:32,780
you have to integrate several times.

1309
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:35,780
So in any case, you will see here,

1310
02:19:35,780 --> 02:19:42,780
the Bayesian theorem allows us to, you know,

1311
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:47,780
group those, depending on both theta and X,

1312
02:19:47,780 --> 02:19:53,780
within this interior integration, theta.

1313
02:19:53,780 --> 02:19:58,780
And then, once you integrate with respect to over theta,

1314
02:19:58,780 --> 02:20:02,780
it will no longer be a function of theta.

1315
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:04,780
So that's a very basic idea.

1316
02:20:04,780 --> 02:20:08,780
You integrate over one variable, then you take the average.

1317
02:20:08,780 --> 02:20:11,780
So this variable is a common.

1318
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:15,780
You still have the theta, sorry.

1319
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:18,780
The first integration with respect to theta.

1320
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:24,780
You integrate with theta, then you will no longer see the theta,

1321
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:29,780
but you still have X there.

1322
02:20:29,780 --> 02:20:33,780
So it will still be a function of X.

1323
02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:37,780
That's why you integrate there.

1324
02:20:37,780 --> 02:20:43,780
So you see here, you no longer see the theta.

1325
02:20:43,780 --> 02:20:44,780
The theta hat is different.

1326
02:20:44,780 --> 02:20:51,780
Theta hat is the one depending on the observation of the X,

1327
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:56,780
but not depending on theta anymore, because theta,

1328
02:20:56,780 --> 02:21:00,780
we estimate the theta based on the data.

1329
02:21:00,780 --> 02:21:02,780
So you will become a function.

1330
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:04,780
Theta hat is a function of the data,

1331
02:21:04,780 --> 02:21:09,780
but no function of the theta without hat, except.

1332
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:13,780
And this insight is precisely what we have here.

1333
02:21:13,780 --> 02:21:14,780
You see?

1334
02:21:14,780 --> 02:21:19,780
The one, the so-called average cost,

1335
02:21:19,780 --> 02:21:22,780
given the observation data.

1336
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:25,780
So we put what's inside here.

1337
02:21:25,780 --> 02:21:31,780
So now this is, the other way is you can consider first,

1338
02:21:31,780 --> 02:21:33,780
so it's a two-step approach.

1339
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:37,780
First, we assume we measure certain observation data.

1340
02:21:37,780 --> 02:21:42,780
Then we treat this measured data as not printed,

1341
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:45,780
so we integrate this data.

1342
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:50,780
And then after that, because our actual observation also

1343
02:21:50,780 --> 02:21:55,780
is a random variable, then you can, again,

1344
02:21:55,780 --> 02:22:01,780
you see here, assume the data at a certain period it's used.

1345
02:22:01,780 --> 02:22:07,780
Again, because this is a total of all the X,

1346
02:22:07,780 --> 02:22:11,780
we integrate it again over all the possible X.

1347
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:23,780
So that's how this links together as a joint distribution.

1348
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:27,780
So therefore, the estimate here, coming back,

1349
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:32,780
if we minimize the Bayes' risk, the one we defined early,

1350
02:22:32,780 --> 02:22:40,780
it will be called Bayes' estimator, based on that.

1351
02:22:40,780 --> 02:22:44,780
And then, so again here, the Bayes' risk,

1352
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:51,780
it will depend on how you select the error,

1353
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:58,780
you know, the risk function we defined early.

1354
02:22:58,780 --> 02:23:04,780
By choosing a different one, you will get a different estimator.

1355
02:23:04,780 --> 02:23:09,780
So one of them, as I mentioned, as I said earlier,

1356
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:11,780
is this quadratic one.

1357
02:23:11,780 --> 02:23:16,780
It's the one easier to do, and this is very popular.

1358
02:23:16,780 --> 02:23:21,780
So this is what we call a minimum mean square error,

1359
02:23:21,780 --> 02:23:26,780
or ensure it's MMSE estimator.

1360
02:23:26,780 --> 02:23:29,780
What I do here is we try to minimize this.

1361
02:23:29,780 --> 02:23:36,780
Then you put, now we have the risk cost function.

1362
02:23:36,780 --> 02:23:39,780
But as I say, this function you need

1363
02:23:39,780 --> 02:23:44,780
to integrate over the possible zeta,

1364
02:23:44,780 --> 02:23:47,780
because it's not a fixed value.

1365
02:23:47,780 --> 02:23:51,780
You take a possible distribution.

1366
02:23:51,780 --> 02:23:53,780
And then, given the measured data,

1367
02:23:53,780 --> 02:24:00,780
we put this condition, you know, PDF into that.

1368
02:24:00,780 --> 02:24:06,780
And this is, again, similar to what we did early

1369
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:09,780
in the CIOB derivation.

1370
02:24:09,780 --> 02:24:11,780
That's why I say the several part,

1371
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:13,780
you study the early part well.

1372
02:24:13,780 --> 02:24:14,780
You have good understanding.

1373
02:24:14,780 --> 02:24:19,780
It's easier to apply it to this one here.

1374
02:24:19,780 --> 02:24:22,780
So therefore, you want to get minimized.

1375
02:24:22,780 --> 02:24:27,780
And one difficult approach is you take a derivation.

1376
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:29,780
But you have to be careful.

1377
02:24:29,780 --> 02:24:35,780
Our derivation is with respect to this zeta hat, as you see here.

1378
02:24:35,780 --> 02:24:39,780
It's not the zeta here.

1379
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:44,780
Because as you see here, you integrate over zeta.

1380
02:24:44,780 --> 02:24:49,780
After integration, it will no longer be a function of zeta.

1381
02:24:49,780 --> 02:24:54,780
It will be a function of zeta hat, condition of x.

1382
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:56,780
So we take the derivative with this.

1383
02:24:56,780 --> 02:25:01,780
So you put the first order derivative inside, you see.

1384
02:25:01,780 --> 02:25:05,780
Now we take the derivative, assume we can exchange

1385
02:25:05,780 --> 02:25:07,780
the derivation integration.

1386
02:25:07,780 --> 02:25:08,780
You put it inside.

1387
02:25:08,780 --> 02:25:13,780
So this is a quadratic function of the zeta hat.

1388
02:25:13,780 --> 02:25:17,780
You take the derivative, bring these two down here.

1389
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:21,780
And then for this zeta hat, you don't have a negative sign.

1390
02:25:21,780 --> 02:25:23,780
And make it equal to zero.

1391
02:25:23,780 --> 02:25:26,780
So again, this is, you have two term here.

1392
02:25:26,780 --> 02:25:31,780
You see your brain, one and then the other.

1393
02:25:31,780 --> 02:25:33,780
And then you also have to be careful.

1394
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:35,780
We want to solve zeta hat.

1395
02:25:35,780 --> 02:25:39,780
And then you observe zeta hat is independent of zeta.

1396
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:43,780
You can, in this integration, you can take it out.

1397
02:25:43,780 --> 02:25:45,780
So this zeta hat, multiply this.

1398
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:47,780
Within integration, you can take it out.

1399
02:25:47,780 --> 02:25:49,780
But not this zeta, you see.

1400
02:25:49,780 --> 02:25:51,780
This zeta is no hat.

1401
02:25:51,780 --> 02:25:54,780
It's part of the integration.

1402
02:25:54,780 --> 02:25:57,780
So you have to keep this one in.

1403
02:25:57,780 --> 02:26:02,780
So finally, we solve this zeta hat.

1404
02:26:02,780 --> 02:26:07,780
So that's how this is done here.

1405
02:26:07,780 --> 02:26:11,780
And then PDF, even conditional PDF,

1406
02:26:11,780 --> 02:26:16,780
you can see with respect to this zeta.

1407
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:19,780
You integrate all over all the possible range.

1408
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:20,780
It's equal to one.

1409
02:26:20,780 --> 02:26:23,780
That's what we already know.

1410
02:26:23,780 --> 02:26:26,780
So therefore, our various estimate here

1411
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:33,780
is just equal to the so-called condition expectation.

1412
02:26:33,780 --> 02:26:38,780
So based on the data here,

1413
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:44,780
we estimated zeta conditioning on the major data.

1414
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:49,780
So this is the expectation, also we call it means,

1415
02:26:49,780 --> 02:26:54,780
the posterior period of the zeta

1416
02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:59,780
given a set of the measurement x.

1417
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:03,780
And the result right here is we do not assume, say,

1418
02:27:03,780 --> 02:27:05,780
any underlying period.

1419
02:27:05,780 --> 02:27:07,780
Just assume it has a period,

1420
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:10,780
but it can be Gaussian, can be other form.

1421
02:27:10,780 --> 02:27:19,780
So this is very, very general.

1422
02:27:19,780 --> 02:27:25,780
So early on, we define quite a few, you know, cost function.

1423
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:29,780
And then usually different function, cost function,

1424
02:27:29,780 --> 02:27:35,780
you put in your angle with different various estimator,

1425
02:27:35,780 --> 02:27:40,780
except the Gaussian.

1426
02:27:40,780 --> 02:27:42,780
Gaussian, that's why Gaussian is very special

1427
02:27:42,780 --> 02:27:47,780
if you're looking at Gaussian distribution.

1428
02:27:47,780 --> 02:27:52,780
So they all become the same.

1429
02:27:52,780 --> 02:27:57,780
You can see, here it all means you're corresponding to the,

1430
02:27:57,780 --> 02:28:00,780
in statistics we call it as a mode.

1431
02:28:00,780 --> 02:28:03,780
I mean, it's more like the,

1432
02:28:03,780 --> 02:28:07,780
later you will see this is very similar to our MLE.

1433
02:28:07,780 --> 02:28:12,780
We call here MAP.

1434
02:28:12,780 --> 02:28:15,780
You get the optimal, the so-called value

1435
02:28:15,780 --> 02:28:18,780
using these criteria is you're getting the mode.

1436
02:28:18,780 --> 02:28:22,780
Mode mean you get the maximum peak,

1437
02:28:22,780 --> 02:28:25,780
then the corresponding value.

1438
02:28:25,780 --> 02:28:29,780
But quadratic, you get the mean value, which is right here.

1439
02:28:29,780 --> 02:28:34,780
And if you use absolute, then you get the median,

1440
02:28:34,780 --> 02:28:39,780
absolute, using the absolute cost function.

1441
02:28:39,780 --> 02:28:44,780
So median is for those who learn image processing before

1442
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:48,780
and at the same time you will see median filter.

1443
02:28:48,780 --> 02:28:51,780
You define the, the median is not average,

1444
02:28:51,780 --> 02:28:55,780
not like the mean, not the mode.

1445
02:28:55,780 --> 02:28:59,780
All depending on the, you're ranking those values

1446
02:28:59,780 --> 02:29:03,780
and then pick the one in the middle.

1447
02:29:03,780 --> 02:29:05,780
But for Gaussian, for stereo video,

1448
02:29:05,780 --> 02:29:08,780
it happened to be that all of them are the same.

1449
02:29:08,780 --> 02:29:11,780
So you just, you only need to get,

1450
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:13,780
using one of the criteria, whatever is easiest.

1451
02:29:13,780 --> 02:29:15,780
Once you get one, you get the other.

1452
02:29:15,780 --> 02:29:23,780
So that's why Gaussian become very, very special.

1453
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:31,780
So here, you should know here in the estimation theory.

1454
02:29:31,780 --> 02:29:35,780
So the way why we need to use the Bayesian

1455
02:29:35,780 --> 02:29:41,780
or want to use this approach is if you recall early,

1456
02:29:41,780 --> 02:29:45,780
all the other traditional estimation theory,

1457
02:29:45,780 --> 02:29:51,780
you cannot make good use of the prior information.

1458
02:29:51,780 --> 02:29:57,780
We may just assume, say, A is positive and so on,

1459
02:29:57,780 --> 02:30:03,780
but that's the constraint rather than you make good use of that.

1460
02:30:03,780 --> 02:30:07,780
But then if you are using this Bayesian approach,

1461
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:11,780
you can incorporate those prime information.

1462
02:30:11,780 --> 02:30:14,780
Say you know the prior PDF,

1463
02:30:14,780 --> 02:30:21,780
so you can incorporate into the estimator.

1464
02:30:21,780 --> 02:30:31,780
So that's the main advantage using this Bayesian estimation.

1465
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:39,780
Even if you are dealing with more deterministic unknown parameters.

1466
02:30:39,780 --> 02:30:44,780
So that's the main difference or, say, motivation.

1467
02:30:44,780 --> 02:30:50,780
Okay, so let's go through this example quickly.

1468
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:53,780
We will end this part.

1469
02:30:53,780 --> 02:30:58,780
At least give you some head start for this topic.

1470
02:30:58,780 --> 02:31:04,780
So this is very similar to what we did before.

1471
02:31:04,780 --> 02:31:06,780
It's a simple model.

1472
02:31:06,780 --> 02:31:13,780
DC level in white Gaussian noise with variance sigma times 2.

1473
02:31:13,780 --> 02:31:18,780
But now the main difference is our DC level A here

1474
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:24,780
is not deterministic, not a fixed value as we did before.

1475
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:27,780
Now it's also a random variable.

1476
02:31:27,780 --> 02:31:31,780
And then the prior PDF here is, you see, prime.

1477
02:31:31,780 --> 02:31:35,780
Before we measure data, we know it's a uniform distribution

1478
02:31:35,780 --> 02:31:40,780
over this range from minor A0 to A0.

1479
02:31:40,780 --> 02:31:47,780
So therefore, from here, conditional PDF of the data,

1480
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:48,780
you see here.

1481
02:31:48,780 --> 02:31:54,780
So conditional PDF, you need to see whether data conditional A

1482
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:58,780
or A conditional on the data.

1483
02:31:58,780 --> 02:32:03,780
So it's easier if you know, because we know this distribution

1484
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:05,780
like what we did before.

1485
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:10,780
So except now if the A is random, then you have two random variables.

1486
02:32:10,780 --> 02:32:16,780
But assuming we fix A, you see, the A is random,

1487
02:32:16,780 --> 02:32:20,780
but A takes some realization within that.

1488
02:32:20,780 --> 02:32:23,780
For example, you take one of the value of A,

1489
02:32:23,780 --> 02:32:29,780
then you can treat this measure data now as a standard way

1490
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:34,780
of DC in white Gaussian noise.

1491
02:32:34,780 --> 02:32:40,780
So in this case, the conditional PDF here is the same

1492
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:46,780
as what we did before.

1493
02:32:46,780 --> 02:32:49,780
You see the mean equal to A, and then everything else,

1494
02:32:49,780 --> 02:32:55,780
like our, you know, our PDF.

1495
02:32:55,780 --> 02:33:02,780
Particularly if A is, you know, you take one realization,

1496
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:04,780
take some fixed value.

1497
02:33:04,780 --> 02:33:08,780
So it will just be the PDF of the data.

1498
02:33:08,780 --> 02:33:11,780
So that's how this is done here.

1499
02:33:11,780 --> 02:33:17,780
And then the Bayes MME estimate, based on what we learned before,

1500
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:27,780
is we are taking this E of expectation of the A conditional on X.

1501
02:33:27,780 --> 02:33:30,780
So now you have to be careful.

1502
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:34,780
We are doing the other one, so this is X conditional on A.

1503
02:33:34,780 --> 02:33:41,780
So this is, you know, based on what we learned is A conditional on X.

1504
02:33:41,780 --> 02:33:45,780
But then you use the Bayesian approach.

1505
02:33:45,780 --> 02:33:54,780
You can see here, because we don't have the PDF of A conditional on X

1506
02:33:54,780 --> 02:33:56,780
based on what we have here.

1507
02:33:56,780 --> 02:34:03,780
But on the other hand, we have P of A here, and also a PX conditional on A.

1508
02:34:03,780 --> 02:34:09,780
Now you can see this can be related in this way,

1509
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:17,780
so that we have already everything we need here.

1510
02:34:17,780 --> 02:34:21,780
And now the topic is a little bit complicated,

1511
02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:24,780
because we substitute something here,

1512
02:34:24,780 --> 02:34:29,780
then because it's a uniform distribution of a minor A0 to A0.

1513
02:34:29,780 --> 02:34:32,780
So we don't need to integrate from minor,

1514
02:34:32,780 --> 02:34:36,780
because here it's only one random variable, from minor infinity to infinity.

1515
02:34:36,780 --> 02:34:43,780
So because of the prior PDF of A, we can integrate over this way.

1516
02:34:43,780 --> 02:34:48,780
And you can see the difference between numerator and denominator is

1517
02:34:48,780 --> 02:34:54,780
only this A in the numerator, the rest is the same here.

1518
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:56,780
So here is A, here is BA.

1519
02:34:56,780 --> 02:34:58,780
You cannot take this A out.

1520
02:34:58,780 --> 02:35:02,780
If you take A out, then you will be set, you can cancel out.

1521
02:35:02,780 --> 02:35:07,780
So how to handle that?

1522
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:12,780
Again, you need a little bit trick to rewrite this.

1523
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:17,780
So this is one summation, this is quadratic term.

1524
02:35:17,780 --> 02:35:20,780
You can show this.

1525
02:35:20,780 --> 02:35:24,780
This one you can write in the sum of this.

1526
02:35:24,780 --> 02:35:26,780
Why we want to write in this way?

1527
02:35:26,780 --> 02:35:30,780
Because for data, the data, you know,

1528
02:35:30,780 --> 02:35:35,780
eventually our estimator need to depend on the data only.

1529
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:41,780
So we want to separate the A into the data,

1530
02:35:41,780 --> 02:35:43,780
because our A here is mixed.

1531
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:49,780
Usually inside the power of two terms it's very hard to enter.

1532
02:35:49,780 --> 02:35:53,780
But if you all write into the standard way here,

1533
02:35:53,780 --> 02:35:56,780
this is A becomes this one fixed value.

1534
02:35:56,780 --> 02:35:58,780
Right here, you have the different values.

1535
02:35:58,780 --> 02:36:00,780
So this one you can do all this time.

1536
02:36:00,780 --> 02:36:03,780
You can prove, you can show out of today.

1537
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:06,780
And after that, you will be simplified.

1538
02:36:06,780 --> 02:36:08,780
You see, we rewrite this.

1539
02:36:08,780 --> 02:36:11,780
And this term is a constant, you see.

1540
02:36:11,780 --> 02:36:13,780
In terms of A constant, you can take out,

1541
02:36:13,780 --> 02:36:16,780
because it's the same for both numerator and denominator.

1542
02:36:16,780 --> 02:36:17,780
You pull out.

1543
02:36:17,780 --> 02:36:18,780
Then what you let is this.

1544
02:36:18,780 --> 02:36:20,780
You have A here, A here, cannot.

1545
02:36:20,780 --> 02:36:24,780
So that's a simple way.

1546
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:29,780
And out of that, you can apply some tricks

1547
02:36:29,780 --> 02:36:33,780
to take out this X sample mean.

1548
02:36:33,780 --> 02:36:39,780
And then what let is the numerator again integrate.

1549
02:36:39,780 --> 02:36:41,780
But the denominator, there's no way,

1550
02:36:41,780 --> 02:36:45,780
because this is our very standard error function.

1551
02:36:45,780 --> 02:36:49,780
Integrate from zero to X using this term.

1552
02:36:49,780 --> 02:36:52,780
Because there's no way, there's no analytic solution.

1553
02:36:52,780 --> 02:36:56,780
But you can do it numerically.

1554
02:36:56,780 --> 02:37:04,780
So therefore, this is what you can get, our A heads here.

1555
02:37:04,780 --> 02:37:07,780
And then you can also get the posterior period,

1556
02:37:07,780 --> 02:37:13,780
which is the one numerator you don't integrate.

1557
02:37:13,780 --> 02:37:16,780
So the denominator is still the same.

1558
02:37:16,780 --> 02:37:19,780
And therefore, this one is you can use similar approach

1559
02:37:19,780 --> 02:37:21,780
based on what you did.

1560
02:37:21,780 --> 02:37:23,780
Except I don't need to integrate.

1561
02:37:23,780 --> 02:37:25,780
You end up with this.

1562
02:37:25,780 --> 02:37:31,780
I think we will stop here, because there

1563
02:37:31,780 --> 02:37:34,780
are a lot of materials to establish.

1564
02:37:34,780 --> 02:37:44,780
And I just give you some idea of how this Bayesian approach

1565
02:37:44,780 --> 02:37:45,780
looks like.

1566
02:37:45,780 --> 02:37:49,780
So it means we pay you for the next week.

1567
02:37:49,780 --> 02:37:51,780
And you can download the assignment,

1568
02:37:51,780 --> 02:37:58,780
and then take a look and see how difficult or how easy

1569
02:37:58,780 --> 02:38:00,780
you can do it.

1570
02:38:00,780 --> 02:38:06,780
OK, I think I will stop here and see you next week.

1571
02:38:06,780 --> 02:38:07,780
Any questions?

1572
02:38:07,780 --> 02:38:11,780
Then you can stay back or you can email me.

1573
02:38:14,780 --> 02:38:15,780
Thank you.

1574
02:38:44,780 --> 02:38:45,780
Any questions?

1575
02:38:52,780 --> 02:38:53,780
Yes?

1576
02:38:53,780 --> 02:38:55,780
I have one more question.

1577
02:38:55,780 --> 02:38:58,780
Sure.

1578
02:38:58,780 --> 02:39:00,780
You know this.

1579
02:39:00,780 --> 02:39:02,780
It's estimated.

1580
02:39:02,780 --> 02:39:08,780
So how can we from this to this?

1581
02:39:08,780 --> 02:39:09,780
OK.

1582
02:39:09,780 --> 02:39:13,780
So first, you know how to rewrite this.

1583
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:15,780
Assume this one.

1584
02:39:15,780 --> 02:39:17,780
This is not a negative integration.

1585
02:39:17,780 --> 02:39:25,780
So this one, you break this summation to this one.

1586
02:39:25,780 --> 02:39:27,780
You can verify.

1587
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:32,780
So once you put this on, you see the both of them.

1588
02:39:32,780 --> 02:39:36,780
You basically substitute this term

1589
02:39:36,780 --> 02:39:39,780
into the sum of this term and that term.

1590
02:39:39,780 --> 02:39:41,780
Because this is irrelevant?

1591
02:39:41,780 --> 02:39:42,780
Yes, yes, yes.

1592
02:39:43,780 --> 02:39:48,780
So what that is, you see, so you only leave this term here.

1593
02:39:48,780 --> 02:39:52,780
So from here to here, there will be no problem.

1594
02:39:52,780 --> 02:39:57,780
So now from here to the next one is really difficult because.

1595
02:39:57,780 --> 02:40:04,780
So what you do here is you know for exponential integration.

1596
02:40:04,780 --> 02:40:07,780
If you only have the exponential raise power 2,

1597
02:40:07,780 --> 02:40:10,780
you cannot integrate this denominator.

1598
02:40:10,780 --> 02:40:18,780
But the numerator, if I subtract this x hat.

1599
02:40:18,780 --> 02:40:22,780
So they create, you have the same term.

1600
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:24,780
Except this is power 2.

1601
02:40:24,780 --> 02:40:29,780
Then you also you need a in x hat.

1602
02:40:29,780 --> 02:40:34,780
Minus sample mean of x plus.

1603
02:40:34,780 --> 02:40:37,780
Now that one of them you can integrate.

1604
02:40:37,780 --> 02:40:38,780
So that's why you end up integrate.

1605
02:40:38,780 --> 02:40:41,780
Then the other one, you add the x hat.

1606
02:40:41,780 --> 02:40:45,780
Then you can accept x bar.

1607
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:47,780
It's a constant.

1608
02:40:47,780 --> 02:40:48,780
Pull out.

1609
02:40:48,780 --> 02:40:51,780
Well, then you give you this.

1610
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:53,780
So how do you get the other one is?

1611
02:40:53,780 --> 02:40:56,780
You add the one minus x, you get this one first.

1612
02:40:56,780 --> 02:41:00,780
Then what the other term is, you become the integrator.

1613
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:02,780
You see x.

1614
02:41:02,780 --> 02:41:04,780
You change the variable.

1615
02:41:04,780 --> 02:41:06,780
You can integrate.

1616
02:41:06,780 --> 02:41:10,780
X and exponential minus x power 2.

1617
02:41:10,780 --> 02:41:14,780
That's how you can change the variable.

1618
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:16,780
You can integrate that one.

1619
02:41:16,780 --> 02:41:20,780
So that's why the numerator, you can integrate into the energy one.

1620
02:41:20,780 --> 02:41:22,780
But the denominator cannot do that.

1621
02:41:22,780 --> 02:41:25,780
You don't get A here.

1622
02:41:25,780 --> 02:41:32,780
So you can only write this error function to do it automatically.

1623
02:41:33,780 --> 02:41:36,780
I will try the other one.

1624
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:39,780
In your end, could I email you?

1625
02:41:39,780 --> 02:41:41,780
Sure, sure, sure.

1626
02:41:41,780 --> 02:41:43,780
Thank you.

1627
02:41:44,780 --> 02:41:46,780
How long does it take?

1628
02:41:46,780 --> 02:41:49,780
It takes a long time.

1629
02:41:49,780 --> 02:41:51,780
It takes a long time.

1630
02:41:51,780 --> 02:41:53,780
It takes a long time.

1631
02:41:53,780 --> 02:41:55,780
It takes a long time.

1632
02:41:55,780 --> 02:41:57,780
It takes a long time.

1633
02:41:57,780 --> 02:41:59,780
It takes a long time.

1634
02:41:59,780 --> 02:42:01,780
It takes a long time.

1635
02:42:01,780 --> 02:42:03,780
It takes a long time.

1636
02:42:03,780 --> 02:42:05,780
It takes a long time.

1637
02:42:05,780 --> 02:42:07,780
It takes a long time.

1638
02:42:07,780 --> 02:42:09,780
It takes a long time.

1639
02:42:09,780 --> 02:42:11,780
It takes a long time.

1640
02:42:11,780 --> 02:42:13,780
Okay.

1641
02:42:13,780 --> 02:42:15,780
Okay.

1642
02:42:15,780 --> 02:42:17,780
We saw it.

1643
02:42:17,780 --> 02:42:19,780
Where is it?

1644
02:42:19,780 --> 02:42:21,780
Write clearly.

1645
02:42:21,780 --> 02:42:23,780
Write clearly.

1646
02:42:23,780 --> 02:42:25,780
Type reform.

1647
02:42:25,780 --> 02:42:27,780
Let's talk please.

1648
02:42:27,780 --> 02:42:29,780
Okay.

1649
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:37,780
Thank you, thank you.

1650
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:39,980
I'm sure you thought...

1651
02:42:41,380 --> 02:42:43,220
S overall,

1652
02:42:43,220 --> 02:42:44,480
yes, of course we are technology

1653
02:42:44,480 --> 02:42:46,560
and the energy sources.

1654
02:42:46,560 --> 02:42:48,400
That's it.

1655
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:49,860
And what if we add cup?

1656
02:42:49,860 --> 02:42:53,360
We have to add.

1657
02:42:54,780 --> 02:42:57,020
Then he just means that energy sources.

1658
02:42:57,020 --> 02:43:02,120
You need to add Roger or disagreed with it

1659
02:43:02,120 --> 02:43:03,380
to a robot.

1660
02:43:03,380 --> 02:43:07,480
I can't remember what happened.

1661
02:43:07,480 --> 02:43:11,480
I think it's a good idea to expand.

1662
02:43:11,480 --> 02:43:16,480
Can you tell us a little bit more about your experience?

1663
02:43:16,480 --> 02:43:20,480
Yes, I think it's a good idea to expand.

Yes.

1700
02:45:17,480 --> 02:45:20,480
How much time is in the slide?

1701
02:45:20,480 --> 02:45:23,480
21.

1702
02:45:23,480 --> 02:45:29,480
I want to ask why the right-hand side is not different from in the CIRLE.

1703
02:45:29,480 --> 02:45:31,480
Why the right-hand side here?

1704
02:45:31,480 --> 02:45:32,480
CIRLE.

1705
02:45:32,480 --> 02:45:33,480
Yeah.

1706
02:45:33,480 --> 02:45:36,480
So in the CIRLE example.

1707
02:45:36,480 --> 02:45:42,480
This is a different topic because our...

1708
02:45:42,480 --> 02:45:47,480
In this last two chapters, we are dealing with random variables.

1709
02:45:47,480 --> 02:45:50,480
X and Y is also random variable.

1710
02:45:50,480 --> 02:45:52,480
So A is also random variable.

1711
02:45:52,480 --> 02:45:54,480
So now we have to take up...

1712
02:45:54,480 --> 02:45:56,480
We have the boost field of property, right?

1713
02:45:56,480 --> 02:45:57,480
Yes.

1714
02:45:57,480 --> 02:45:58,480
Okay, sure.

1715
02:45:58,480 --> 02:46:02,480
That's why you need to look into the concept.

1716
02:46:02,480 --> 02:46:11,480
So in the first chapter, I just want to clarify the notation we use here.

1717
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:33,480
So...

1718
02:46:33,480 --> 02:46:35,480
Just to take example.

1719
02:46:36,480 --> 02:46:40,480
In the CIRLE, what does this mean?

1720
02:46:40,480 --> 02:46:45,480
This notation is property density...

1721
02:46:45,480 --> 02:46:46,480
Okay.

1722
02:46:46,480 --> 02:46:47,480
This one is...

1723
02:46:47,480 --> 02:46:51,480
Our A here is just a deterministic parameter.

1724
02:46:51,480 --> 02:46:55,480
So it's like a function of the property density function?

1725
02:46:55,480 --> 02:46:56,480
Yes.

1726
02:46:56,480 --> 02:46:57,480
It's dependent on A, right?

1727
02:46:57,480 --> 02:47:00,480
Our A here is a different interpretation.

1728
02:47:00,480 --> 02:47:02,480
Our A here is just a parameter.

1729
02:47:02,480 --> 02:47:04,480
A take maybe a value of...

1730
02:47:04,480 --> 02:47:08,480
Can take different value, one or two, but it's not random.

1731
02:47:08,480 --> 02:47:09,480
So in this...

1732
02:47:09,480 --> 02:47:13,480
It's not random, but the function of A here is dependent on A, right?

1733
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:22,480
A in the sense of the mean value, the A or the coefficient change.

1734
02:47:22,480 --> 02:47:23,480
But it's not...

1735
02:47:23,480 --> 02:47:28,480
You don't interpret A here as a random variable.

1736
02:47:28,480 --> 02:47:30,480
So the main difference is...

1737
02:47:31,480 --> 02:47:34,480
In the last one, our A there is...

1738
02:47:34,480 --> 02:47:35,480
Random variable.

1739
02:47:35,480 --> 02:47:36,480
It's a random variable.

1740
02:47:36,480 --> 02:47:41,480
But unless you are conditioner, if you are taking the condition P there,

1741
02:47:41,480 --> 02:47:45,480
and you assume the A there, like our first derivation,

1742
02:47:45,480 --> 02:47:48,480
you will be not random.

1743
02:47:48,480 --> 02:47:51,480
You will be treating it similar to this.

1744
02:47:51,480 --> 02:47:53,480
Consider A as a deterministic...

1745
02:47:53,480 --> 02:47:56,480
So we consider here A is a parameter, right?

1746
02:47:56,480 --> 02:47:57,480
Yes, yes, yes.

1747
02:47:57,480 --> 02:47:58,480
A is a parameter.

1748
02:47:59,480 --> 02:48:03,480
Later in the second part, the detection,

1749
02:48:03,480 --> 02:48:06,480
we are also phasing the similar 4.1,

1750
02:48:06,480 --> 02:48:10,480
whether it's random or it's a parameter.

1751
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:14,480
So when you talk about you adding or weighting here,

1752
02:48:14,480 --> 02:48:20,480
I don't know, the simple expression is like this, is that okay?

1753
02:48:21,480 --> 02:48:27,480
But you need to see, because for the no weighting one,

1754
02:48:27,480 --> 02:48:29,480
you can show they are the same.

1755
02:48:29,480 --> 02:48:30,480
But I'm not quite sure.

1756
02:48:30,480 --> 02:48:32,480
It seems no weighting one.

1757
02:48:32,480 --> 02:48:33,480
You can try to see.

1758
02:48:33,480 --> 02:48:37,480
Yes, it's just like you multiply A inside, yeah?

1759
02:48:37,480 --> 02:48:41,480
So from here to here, it's just this?

1760
02:48:41,480 --> 02:48:44,480
Like a theta hat?

1761
02:48:44,480 --> 02:48:45,480
You see?

1762
02:48:45,480 --> 02:48:46,480
You see.

1763
02:48:47,480 --> 02:48:50,480
Not... Let me see here.

1764
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:51,480
A inside?

1765
02:48:52,480 --> 02:48:54,480
A inside, yeah.

1766
02:48:54,480 --> 02:48:57,480
From here to here, it's a theta hat?

1767
02:48:58,480 --> 02:48:59,480
You see?

1768
02:49:03,480 --> 02:49:04,480
Then maybe...

1769
02:49:04,480 --> 02:49:08,480
Then you take W, make sure outside,

1770
02:49:08,480 --> 02:49:10,480
then you've got this formula?

1771
02:49:11,480 --> 02:49:14,480
This symbol is over here.

1772
02:49:14,480 --> 02:49:16,480
I don't know, I don't know.

1773
02:49:16,480 --> 02:49:18,480
Yeah, maybe.

1774
02:49:20,480 --> 02:49:23,480
Initially I thought it would be different, yeah.

1775
02:49:23,480 --> 02:49:24,480
Okay.

1776
02:49:24,480 --> 02:49:26,480
But yeah, maybe it's the same.

1777
02:49:26,480 --> 02:49:30,480
You can try to see whether you explain it the same.

1778
02:49:30,480 --> 02:49:31,480
Yeah, probably the same.

1779
02:49:31,480 --> 02:49:33,480
Let me verify that.

1780
02:49:33,480 --> 02:49:36,480
One time I thought it was not the same.

1781
02:49:36,480 --> 02:49:39,480
But good, good for you to point out this.

1782
02:49:39,480 --> 02:49:42,480
I will verify that.

1783
02:49:42,480 --> 02:49:43,480
Yeah.

1784
02:49:43,480 --> 02:49:45,480
Thanks for reaching out.

1785
02:49:45,480 --> 02:49:49,480
So in an example here, right here.

1786
02:49:49,480 --> 02:49:54,480
In example, slice 97,

1787
02:49:54,480 --> 02:49:56,480
I actually want to ask,

1788
02:49:56,480 --> 02:49:59,480
how can we satisfy this parameter here?

1789
02:49:59,480 --> 02:50:02,480
Why theta hat includes both A and a variance?

1790
02:50:02,480 --> 02:50:03,480
Why?

1791
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:07,480
Because I think the W here is just a white noise, right?

1792
02:50:07,480 --> 02:50:09,480
It's a white noise, so we...

1793
02:50:09,480 --> 02:50:11,480
As in particular implementation,

1794
02:50:11,480 --> 02:50:13,480
we have to care about its writing.

1795
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:14,480
Oh yes, yes.

1796
02:50:14,480 --> 02:50:16,480
Because sometimes the value, we don't know.

1797
02:50:16,480 --> 02:50:18,480
So you may need estimate.

1798
02:50:18,480 --> 02:50:20,480
This is a very common problem in strategic.

1799
02:50:20,480 --> 02:50:23,480
Sometimes you don't know the value.

1800
02:50:23,480 --> 02:50:26,480
You need to base on the data sample to estimate.

1801
02:50:26,480 --> 02:50:28,480
So this is the case here.

1802
02:50:28,480 --> 02:50:32,480
Because the noise value is sometimes also important.

1803
02:50:32,480 --> 02:50:37,480
You may want to use the measure data to estimate.

1804
02:50:37,480 --> 02:50:41,480
This is a very practical problem, common also.

1805
02:50:41,480 --> 02:50:43,480
You estimate the value,

1806
02:50:43,480 --> 02:50:45,480
because you don't know the value

1807
02:50:45,480 --> 02:50:47,480
based on the measure data you can do.

1808
02:50:48,480 --> 02:50:50,480
I ask you a question,

1809
02:50:50,480 --> 02:50:53,480
because I think we only have to estimate the matrix A here.

1810
02:50:53,480 --> 02:50:57,480
No, matrix A is a common, simple problem.

1811
02:50:57,480 --> 02:50:59,480
You may...

1812
02:50:59,480 --> 02:51:03,480
Sometimes the variance is also unknown.

1813
02:51:03,480 --> 02:51:06,480
You want to estimate both.

1814
02:51:06,480 --> 02:51:08,480
Because it may relate to the quiz,

1815
02:51:08,480 --> 02:51:11,480
because we may miss out something we have to estimate, right?

1816
02:51:11,480 --> 02:51:15,480
Oh yes, in the exam I always make it clear

1817
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:17,480
which one you need to estimate.

1818
02:51:17,480 --> 02:51:19,480
It's a norm.

1819
02:51:19,480 --> 02:51:25,480
So when you try to take the expectations of the insight,

1820
02:51:25,480 --> 02:51:29,480
I may miss out what you have told.

1821
02:51:29,480 --> 02:51:32,480
We take the expectation from this side here first,

1822
02:51:32,480 --> 02:51:34,480
then we take the square bit,

1823
02:51:34,480 --> 02:51:37,480
then we first do it in one...

1824
02:51:37,480 --> 02:51:41,480
Yes, it happens to be equal to A.

1825
02:51:41,480 --> 02:51:44,480
But you're right, you cannot take the expectation.

1826
02:51:44,480 --> 02:51:47,480
You cannot take the expectation inside the nonlinear function.

1827
02:51:47,480 --> 02:51:51,480
But is there a way to do that,

1828
02:51:51,480 --> 02:51:54,480
or you told us to do that, because I am?

1829
02:51:54,480 --> 02:51:57,480
Yes, because the way is...

1830
02:51:57,480 --> 02:52:01,480
Actually, I don't know how to take the expectation

1831
02:52:01,480 --> 02:52:05,480
within the nonlinear function.

1832
02:52:05,480 --> 02:52:08,480
So we just do that.

1833
02:52:08,480 --> 02:52:11,480
If I encounter a nonlinear function,

1834
02:52:11,480 --> 02:52:15,480
I take it from the inside, and I follow all the others.

1835
02:52:15,480 --> 02:52:18,480
No, that's not the right way to do it.

1836
02:52:18,480 --> 02:52:20,480
So this one is the other way.

1837
02:52:20,480 --> 02:52:24,480
If you do that, you happen to become unbiased,

1838
02:52:24,480 --> 02:52:26,480
but it's not the right way.

1839
02:52:26,480 --> 02:52:30,480
So in this example, you said you followed what you told us,

1840
02:52:30,480 --> 02:52:32,480
and if it equals A,

1841
02:52:32,480 --> 02:52:36,480
so you conclude that if we take the expectation of the whole value here,

1842
02:52:36,480 --> 02:52:38,480
it's equal to A, right?

1843
02:52:38,480 --> 02:52:41,480
The expectation of A here will not be equal to A,

1844
02:52:41,480 --> 02:52:48,480
because we don't know how to take in the square root.

1845
02:52:48,480 --> 02:52:50,480
There is no easy way.

1846
02:52:50,480 --> 02:52:54,480
So we are so-called if you do a shortcut,

1847
02:52:54,480 --> 02:52:56,480
which is not the right way to do it.

1848
02:52:56,480 --> 02:52:58,480
It happens to be equal to A.

1849
02:52:58,480 --> 02:53:00,480
So you conclude that it shouldn't be A,

1850
02:53:00,480 --> 02:53:03,480
because you are doing something wrong to get the correct result.

1851
02:53:03,480 --> 02:53:06,480
So the result must be wrong.

1852
02:53:06,480 --> 02:53:09,480
Okay, I understand. Thank you.

1853
02:53:36,480 --> 02:53:38,480
Okay.

1854
02:54:06,480 --> 02:54:08,480
Okay.

1855
02:54:36,480 --> 02:54:38,480
Okay.

1856
02:55:06,480 --> 02:55:08,480
Okay.

1857
02:55:36,480 --> 02:55:38,480
Okay.

1858
02:56:06,480 --> 02:56:08,480
Okay.

1859
02:56:36,480 --> 02:56:38,480
Okay.

1860
02:57:06,480 --> 02:57:08,480
Okay.

1861
02:57:36,480 --> 02:57:38,480
Okay.

1862
02:58:06,480 --> 02:58:08,480
