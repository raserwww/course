1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,520
 As I already mentioned, last week we only had two CA and one is Tech Home assignments

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:24,000
 like homework and the second one will be the quiz which is conducted here.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 So particularly the second one, week 11, so it must be available to come here physically.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,420
 Okay, any questions?

5
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:16,400
 Several students at the back, you can move to the middle.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:26,600
 So I hope maybe next week we start to have some more interactive teaching.

7
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:36,920
 This is the largest class size since I conduct, I taught this course 20 years ago.

8
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,760
 Now it's exactly.

9
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,200
 In the past I think the maximum one is 60 students in this class but now we have 100

10
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
 more like this, 160.

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:02:01,880
 So we'll see how to manage this very big class size.

12
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,600
 Okay, I think it's time to start.

13
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:17,799
 I remember last week we started with some introduction and then mention about the practical

14
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:18,799
 application.

15
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:29,400
 You see here, this is what we...

16
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:41,000
 So yeah, this is one of the very typical and classical applications where we have parameter

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,560
 estimation or you call estimation theory and then the second part will be the signal detection.

18
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,840
 So both of them they are all putting into this course.

19
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:05,720
 So we are not doing the hardware design but more algorithms and the methodologies and theories

20
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:18,000
 will be high to do the practical work if you are applying this into some projects.

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,960
 So of course in between there will be always some research you want to work on.

22
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:35,560
 Maybe next week I can also give you some briefing on some of the work we have done related to

23
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,040
 this course both in estimation and detection.

24
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:52,000
 But before that I promised to share with you some of the projects which related to this

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 one.

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,239
 So yeah, this is the photos of my group working on this.

27
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:13,720
 You see here just now we show the radar and this is a wearable radar.

28
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,040
 Most of these some are undergraduate students.

29
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,760
 At that time there is not many master students.

30
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,800
 So I don't think any master students here but this is PhD student.

31
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,120
 Now he is a professor in China.

32
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,160
 I just visited him a few months ago.

33
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,000
 And this is a postdoc also a professor now in Seoul in South Korea.

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,680
 And then we have a few other some researchers I think probably two girls here.

35
00:04:49,680 --> 00:05:00,560
 Very quick guess.

36
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,920
 How much this radar costs in Singapore dollar?

37
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,880
 Anyone have some idea?

38
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,000
 You are doing the parameter estimation just based on the picture.

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,280
 This is a rare one.

40
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,400
 Usually you can carry it back.

41
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
 We need two guys.

42
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,200
 They show the one carry this one, the other carry the tripods and other.

43
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
 And this is a toy.

44
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,360
 I told you most of you are new to Singapore.

45
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,800
 But you may think NTU is the far western part of Singapore.

46
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,000
 The Changi Airport is on the eastern side.

47
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,960
 You see this is very remote.

48
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,120
 You see Malaysia on the other side.

49
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
 But not really.

50
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:57,680
 If you travel to the further southwestern, Tuas, you will look at the map.

51
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
 Tuas.

52
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,040
 Which is very far from here.

53
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,280
 Even by driving it may take at least 30 minutes.

54
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,239
 So we did the experiment there.

55
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,320
 No one want to guess?

56
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
 Estimate the parameter.

57
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,320
 This is just a number.

58
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
 The cost of this.

59
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,840
 It was very cheap.

60
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,640
 I buy 10 from you.

61
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
 10,000.

62
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,119
 You know those are military products.

63
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,440
 Usually very expensive.

64
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,440
 And this one was made by Thalas.

65
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,960
 It's a very big multinational company.

66
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,800
 The headquarters in the Netherlands.

67
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,720
 So to buy this, I personally, I travel to the Netherlands to sign the contract.

68
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,520
 We need a legal team to work out the contract.

69
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,400
 And it's very long.

70
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,880
 So some more guess?

71
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
 Higher than that of course.

72
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
 10,000 is very cheap.

73
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
 10,000 now is even...

74
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
 How much you can buy?

75
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:12,400
 The car, even the COE is 100,000.

76
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,120
 So think about just the COE.

77
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
 This is big one.

78
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
 Anyone?

79
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
 Very close.

80
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
 How many times?

81
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
 100 times of this guy.

82
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
 Very near, almost near 1 million.

83
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
 Very expensive.

84
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:35,440
 If this radar was...

85
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:44,200
 You only buy to use like the commercial product is half of that, about half a million.

86
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,760
 But then of course you all know if you buy a product, you can use but you cannot get

87
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
 the data.

88
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,560
 So in order to get the data, I think the company say or they need to specially design but it's

89
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
 not true.

90
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:04,560
 What we know is that they just do some setting but they make the function available to you.

91
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,240
 That's why it's still very important you know how to design the algorithms and then

92
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,800
 just this part.

93
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
 It calls double.

94
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,920
 You say, well you want to use the data because we are doing research.

95
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:27,720
 So we are not just look at the UAV and so on but we want to take the data and do the

96
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
 research.

97
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,840
 So we pay more, almost double, almost near 1 million.

98
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
 So you'll see what...

99
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:45,960
 At least we published some paper and this is the defense project.

100
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:52,840
 In the end the Ministry of Defense, they are quite satisfied.

101
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,440
 So this is one of the H.O.B.

102
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,640
 Transaction paper.

103
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,120
 It's a short paper.

104
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,800
 So you see here improving ground data.

105
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,800
 So I go to the setting.

106
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,560
 So this is the one.

107
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,560
 You see here this map is...

108
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,199
 This is the radar you see.

109
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:22,040
 And then at twice there is industry part.

110
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:29,000
 There are a lot of space and just like grass and so on.

111
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,800
 And this is the one doing the roles and radar here.

112
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:43,959
 So we are measuring about in maximum about 1000 meters down to the other side.

113
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:47,680
 Target number one maybe a little bit longer.

114
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,800
 So you see FFT.

115
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,280
 So that's how you apply and the data here.

116
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,719
 You see there is a big noise.

117
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:02,359
 I won't go into the detail.

118
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,200
 So this is one of them.

119
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,800
 And then if you look at this, this is where the model is a very typical one.

120
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,120
 You see here the measure data.

121
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,680
 And this is what I mentioned here.

122
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,320
 In this course statistical signal processing you must contain some measurement noise.

123
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,240
 If no noise you are doing the matrix inverse it will be easy.

124
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,520
 And this is one of the measures.

125
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,640
 And some more later is also related.

126
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:46,160
 So that's why I want to point out where this minimum variance distortion is responsible

127
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,360
 because this last term is applied to array.

128
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,640
 It's doing sensor array.

129
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,440
 So it's talking about distortion and music.

130
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:02,160
 I think for those students taking my other EE6401 you will see music is part of the very

131
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,800
 popular algorithms in Taiwan.

132
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,600
 But we are not going into that.

133
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,640
 So this is very familiar.

134
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,800
 You minimize, you get this.

135
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:31,719
 And that's how you can apply statistical signal processing in some lawyer experiments.

136
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:34,359
 And this is, we can see the picture.

137
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:42,479
 We are basically trying to use this reader to detect and estimate, classify UAV, different

138
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,400
 type of UAV.

139
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:51,520
 So from there you use the reader to send out the transmit signal, get the echo back.

140
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,160
 And this is the data you measure.

141
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:07,760
 No noise and you have to file ways to try to estimate the correct temporal frequencies

142
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,000
 and so on.

143
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,560
 And this is one paper.

144
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,960
 Another one is just a very quick one.

145
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,520
 It's a much longer one than this.

146
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,960
 This is more like applying machine learning.

147
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:27,480
 So it's published in a few years back to the project expert system with application.

148
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:37,280
 So you can see very similar.

149
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,600
 This is, you see here the reader.

150
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:47,000
 You see you transmit the reader, then get your scan, get the data back.

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,160
 And this is, you are doing multiple scans.

152
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,240
 And that's how, as you hear, there is a similar, similar indicator.

153
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,320
 Signal of the week and there's some clutter, noise and so on.

154
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,160
 So that's a different type.

155
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,560
 You will see different reflections.

156
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:15,920
 Working person and there's UAV per car bicycle.

157
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:27,839
 You see that's a big communicated, the whole block diagram and some of the signal.

158
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:38,319
 And then again there are a lot of modeling and all those signal, noise and so on.

159
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:46,240
 So it's more like using machine learning approach.

160
00:13:46,240 --> 00:14:02,640
 So I hope this at least motivates you to see how you can apply into practical problems.

161
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:16,560
 Any questions that you'd like to ask before we start the class now?

162
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:24,760
 So as I say, now I try to do some drawing starting from week two.

163
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:39,200
 And the important concept is at least you should build in your mind to get used to random

164
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:53,960
 signals and also how to relate our cause into some data.

165
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,240
 And then from the major data how to do the parameter estimation.

166
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:07,080
 So let me start with say we have a random signal and then a random signal when you,

167
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:16,040
 when a major typically assume the random variable, they are continuous time.

168
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:23,040
 So you can use the PDF, probability, density function.

169
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:33,880
 So PDF is the most comprehensive description of this random variable because random variable

170
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,040
 we all know if you, we don't know the outcome until it appears.

171
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,240
 So it's like the realization.

172
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:52,599
 So the PDF is just measure how this data or this random variable are likely to come out

173
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 for example if we are very often we are talking about zero mean, zero mean Gaussian noise.

174
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,600
 Gaussian noise.

175
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:20,120
 Say so that means you see you'll have the data, the random signal.

176
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:29,600
 They are most likely, you know, our PDF if you plot the PDF here in this case X this is

177
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
 zero.

178
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:44,560
 So the PDF is most likely going to, going to happen near the zero mean because we are

179
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,560
 assuming the mean value is zero.

180
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:57,079
 Of course if you, the mean is not zero say the mean go to one then of course this pick

181
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,959
 your shift to the position of one.

182
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,040
 That means it's most likely happen near the mean.

183
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:14,560
 And that's how we say typically you know examination mark I mean you all know we do this bell curve

184
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:22,560
 like a moderation that probably agrees until we are doing that.

185
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,560
 So the mean of course is not zero because I mean your mark the lowest is zero.

186
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:37,560
 So say for example the mean is 65 and so if the mark follow this Gaussian distribution

187
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:43,560
 or called normal distribution then the more students are likely to be near 65.

188
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:49,560
 So it may not be exactly 65 it could be 64, 66 and so on.

189
00:17:49,560 --> 00:18:00,560
 So this PDF just measure how likely this random variable the value the output are going to

190
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
 show.

191
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,560
 Because we don't know they pick up the exam even after you are normalized we still don't

192
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,560
 know who is getting into whom.

193
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,560
 We can only say okay the distribution the mark looks like this.

194
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,560
 So that's how this random variable and then we use PDF.

195
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:30,560
 And then after that how do we apply to our case here because we are talking about we

196
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,560
 are measuring N samples you see.

197
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:48,560
 So that's how quite often I have questions and say okay you are talking about your data

198
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:54,560
 discrete time but you are available most of the time we are dealing with continue.

199
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
 So don't confuse.

200
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:04,560
 I can show you assume our measure data you see based on measure data run to measure like

201
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,560
 just a TC value as typically the case okay.

202
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:17,560
 You know our measure signal is A we are assuming here A is greater than zero.

203
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:25,560
 It's a proper positive TC and this is for example Gaussian noise as we just showed.

204
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:32,560
 And then typically we have N samples we start from zero, one and then up to N minus one.

205
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:41,560
 So how does it look like you see our mean is we are assuming constant being you see.

206
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:50,560
 So this is A okay since our measure data is A plus WN which is Gaussian noise we do not

207
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,560
 know how it how it's going to happen.

208
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:07,560
 So therefore let me just show this like scenario if N equal to zero at the first point you

209
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
 see.

210
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,560
 So our measure data may be here but we do not know.

211
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:24,560
 So it's going to you see so you can imagine the theoretically the measure data you can

212
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:31,560
 go all the way you see because Gaussian rate available theoretically it can take continuously

213
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:38,560
 value from minus infinity to infinity but most likely around this mean value which is

214
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
 A.

215
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,560
 So that's how the first data we are getting this and then all about the second one say

216
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:52,560
 N equal to one then the next measure it may be here okay.

217
00:20:52,560 --> 00:21:00,560
 But we do not know until we measure so what based on PDF so we can see at least it's going

218
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:12,560
 to be here and subsequent one say N equal to two and so on so you will be you will be

219
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:22,560
 you will continue like this but to be to be more likely you will see the measure data

220
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:35,560
 more closely near the mean value of A and that's how our course here the this part one

221
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,560
 is based on this measure data say X1, X2 and so on.

222
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:52,560
 So we are trying to try to estimate this the true mean value A, true DC value based on

223
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
 the based on the measure data okay.

224
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:05,560
 So this is what the very very basic idea about estimation and how we are going to link with

225
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:13,560
 our so called PDF and most of the time we are assuming we are dealing with you know the

226
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:20,560
 ring them available or ring them noise where we already know the PDF but of course in some

227
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:27,560
 case we do not assume like some of the some of the methods we only assume you know we

228
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:34,560
 have the measure data perhaps yeah and then based on that we can do okay.

229
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,560
 So the more information you have the maximum information you have about the random variable

230
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,560
 is PDF so I emphasize again we don't know the exact outcome because not possible random

231
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:52,560
 variable but PDF is the best description but if you don't have PDF then you can get some

232
00:22:52,560 --> 00:23:01,560
 you know like mean mean value that's so called false order statistic and you can have a

233
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:08,560
 variant or the second moment so the higher you get you have more information about the

234
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,560
 random variable if you only know the mean and variant this is typically in practical

235
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:20,560
 application you are able to measure those so you have some information limited information

236
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:28,560
 but that could be better than you don't know this random variable at all so that's the

237
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:37,560
 case so the PDF theoretically you can give you infinity higher any order of moments or

238
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:45,560
 variant because you can you have the formula to calculate you should know the PDF okay.

239
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:54,560
 So that's how this is the you know the basic assuming some students you know did not come

240
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:14,560
 and then also have not much background about the yeah about the random variable or statistic.

241
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:22,560
 So let me just highlight again one going to detail terminology I think this is maybe I

242
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:33,560
 switch to both pieces later we can come back here yeah so that's the very basic some of

243
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:41,560
 the concept and the way as I say we are dealing with finite number of measure data the measure

244
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:49,560
 data could be a zero to n minus one or one to n depending on you know some of the power

245
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:57,560
 not that consistent and the number of parameter we also assume in general we are dealing with

246
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:05,560
 the finite number of them of course the simplest one is one and more we don't go into infinity

247
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:12,560
 many parameters they will become like the waveform estimation which is a little bit beyond our

248
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:20,560
 current path okay so these are the one and then this is the estimation error which is

249
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:30,560
 a random quantity and then how to measure mean square error and then in there are several

250
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:39,560
 categorization bias consistent efficient so bias are a bit similar to estimation error

251
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:48,560
 but this is the difference is we apply the expectation which is the mean value in today

252
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:56,560
 so this one become no longer random as you always remember a random variable you take expectation

253
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:04,560
 I mean already already reduce means as I say early in the drawing the once you take mean

254
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:13,560
 then it's no longer random you are taking the become a deterministic value so that therefore

255
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:23,560
 this bias is deterministic so we can have we can have zero bias all this is become zero

256
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:30,560
 but in the early one if you go to this one estimation estimation error you will never

257
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:37,560
 expect this become become zero because you are you are asking a value here it will never be

258
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:45,560
 exactly equal to theta all the time not possible because you you have noise you yeah so that's

259
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:56,560
 that's the main that's the main difference okay and then yeah say we also go through some of these

260
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:05,560
 yeah some student has consistent consistency and also the efficiency yeah this to this one is

261
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:12,560
 assume you when and the number of sample got infinity large we have this property and it

262
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:22,560
 is possible to achieve both consistency and efficiency to do to look into that we will

263
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:31,560
 study this you know I think today we are main focus is on criminal law about chapter 3 CIOB

264
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:41,560
 and then you see how to relate to this and so this is the summary of important PDF I will not go

265
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:50,560
 through this again for those who do not have much knowledge of that you know mostly focus on

266
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:59,560
 Gaussian random variable because so the PDF is here you see and for this one once you know the

267
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,560
 means and variance so this is this is very important so that's why Gaussian random variable is so

268
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:14,560
 important because as I say early normally for other random variable you know your if you know

269
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:23,560
 means and variance were not being up because a PDF theoretically PDF described give you infinity

270
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:36,560
 you know like order of statistics in including third order moment or third order variance and so

271
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,560
 on but however for Gaussian is so special you only need mean means the first order and variance

272
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:50,560
 second order then you already have the PDF so that's very nice but other random variable

273
00:28:50,560 --> 00:29:00,560
 you are usually you cannot do that okay so that's the so especially the know by this this is not

274
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:08,560
 just a normal in is a like Kali graph and like the to differentiate from our normal English

275
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:17,560
 the later of it yeah so that's we did that and then you can keep it a cumulative mean you are

276
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:28,560
 give me lay the this kind of distribution main because normally random variable we are only

277
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:36,560
 looking at say or output the outcome at this point but Kimi lay is a you are measuring from the lowest

278
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:42,560
 one up to this kind of point for example sometimes we are not just interested in the

279
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:52,560
 mean of the your exam mark up to say 35 35 mark we want to know how many of those are students

280
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:59,560
 consider if you are lower than 65 maybe you are below average you want to see how many of them

281
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:07,560
 so that's that's a meaning of cumulative starting from the lowest all the way together yeah okay so and

282
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:13,560
 then the right tail one right there probably is the other side so you are starting at this point we

283
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:20,560
 measure up to the end and so in this exam my is you are measuring those are top students say about

284
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:30,560
 70 70 mark how many and as you know in as as professor every year every end of the semester we have to

285
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:38,560
 go through the meeting and then those are if you are too nice to to student maybe 50 half of the class is

286
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:45,560
 a and but then we we get into trouble cannot make it too easy not too difficult if half of the

287
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:56,560
 student fair I think of course or even lower than 50 then we also face face questions so you have to do it

288
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:06,560
 proper yeah so that's how this distribution is important and then yeah there are some properties

289
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:15,560
 and Gaussian is so important because you can deal with vector and very similar chi square when

290
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:26,560
 we only mainly in the detection part of a goal into that later okay uniform is also important very useful

291
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:35,560
 and then this is the chapter 2 is a layout the foundation it's not difficult but you also need to

292
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:46,560
 spend time to you know to to to you know to see how we are dealing with this problem so basically you can see

293
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:57,560
 estimation parameter estimation we require record two things one is make the estimate estimate and buy

294
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:08,560
 so we call it unbiased estimation and then after that you need to minimize minimize the at the value even so it's

295
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:17,560
 unbiased this theoretically will be your be idea is a all the estimate you'll do is a almost always at the

296
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:26,560
 true value but as I already mentioned if you have noise this is not possible at least with finite number

297
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:35,560
 measure data if you have infinity many data when n go to infinity then it is possible to achieve that that's the

298
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:47,560
 estimate asymptotic property we are going to that later so the whole cause is usually unbiased we are assuming

299
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:58,560
 we we can deal with that is more like you are removing you know your major the data you always have some DC value so

300
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:06,560
 you if you have some knowledge you'll remove the the DC component and the more challenging one and that's how we are

301
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:16,560
 spending most of the time is how to minimize minimize the value even for for both of them is unbiased you know as I

302
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:29,560
 already mentioned if your estimate value very near this true true value take average is unbiased but then if the

303
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:38,560
 variation is a it will be small so it's so it's a very good one so let me maybe show this show this again but this is

304
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:54,560
 not for the major data major data we are now talking about the the let's see how we are doing here now if you

305
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:06,560
 if you're gang you have this a here this is one here so now one of the one of the estimate is I'm looking at the you

306
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:14,560
 know your estimate at this value then then a second one here and a third one maybe here a fourth one exact and fifth one

307
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:32,560
 here so so so you can see this is the one one of the estimation and another estimate value you will give you give you

308
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:44,560
 this the first one here second one here there's one here and so on so so you can so you can see here you know the if you

309
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:55,560
 take the mean the mean estimate you you'll get the both of them are unbiased because the mean value of this is the same as

310
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:05,560
 this is all equal to a but however this one is much worse than the other one because the variation is much larger you see you

311
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:19,560
 don't have commitment you see okay even so you take many major data yeah so that's that's the the main the main the main

312
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:32,560
 difference here is how we are achieving this minimum minimum value there so it looks like the this part is easy you are just achieving one thing

313
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:46,560
 why do we spend like so much effort because the main comparison as I say is you roughly this parameter estimation part is more like you are

314
00:35:46,560 --> 00:36:01,560
 you're trying to solve the integration you know mathematically your calculus you have differentiation or derivative and integration

315
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:11,560
 you all know that derivative you follow the rules it may be very complicated but in the end you can follow step by step but integration even so I tell you the

316
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:24,560
 results there you some of the you know problem may not be so easy so you may file you need to file tricks or so on to like the reverse

317
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:39,560
 problem inverse problem and that's how nw is a big challenging so so I always say test student but in the middle of the of this course like the

318
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:48,560
 assignment one of course assuming you're doing by yourself if you're okay many to get reasonably good understanding and get a good result you shouldn't make

319
00:36:48,560 --> 00:37:04,560
 problem for the for the second part at the detection for those students having some difficulty the first part I will try my best to help but now the class size is much bigger so still a big challenge for me

320
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:24,560
 or see how we can do okay and then we spend some time yeah so so so that's how this one is the estimate as I say you see here eventually you'll get the mean value here but each estimate you see if the

321
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:38,560
 variant is large you see so we can get the very pool in one of the estimation you can get the pool full one very far away from this one but if you have more

322
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:59,560
 metadata or your or your yeah measure when the number of measurement increase so you can see here you see so this is what we say the variance the variance reduce that is a very close to the show on okay so that's how this is done here

323
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:27,560
 and we also discuss why we prefer on bias estimate then the bias one yeah and then also to see when we can achieve and be because just now the the one I mentioned if the true parameter is a constant it will be the very easy case but typically our true value if you see it it will it will be a

324
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:56,560
 function it's not always a fixed value say it's following certain the data here at this first few weeks we are dealing with deterministic parameters so it's it will be a function certain curve like like that so you but it may not be a constant and and our estimate need to follow you know when theta take the value of two you try to estimate it to be two

325
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:26,560
 when you can't find we have to we have to attack to estimate is fine you know not not not like always equal to a value okay so yeah yeah and then this is how as I say you see just like you're doing the integration you don't you don't have this turn the crane turn crane is your follow step by step like you'll take the derivative how will communicate it as long as you know you're not going to do anything wrong.

326
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:54,560
 You know the chain lose can always you can always derive and to get the result so so it started this one CRB this is say one of the few important topic in parameter estimation and it having to be my research not that much in the recent year but in the past.

327
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:04,560
 20 years or so I have a PhD student working on that and we published quite a number of.

328
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:15,560
 You know the good papers later maybe I can share with you but next week when we finish this part.

329
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,560
 Okay and more or less you know the.

330
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:49,560
 Primary estimation you have a few few topic so CRB consider one of the like this two or three important one and you can also see almost every year in the past past exam I try to give maybe not one question or at least have a question on CRB and other one of course is also a maximum like it hook estimation which is every.

331
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:58,560
 Professor teaching this course I should always cut this this this two part is not the other other.

332
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,560
 Okay so now how we are dealing with this way.

333
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:18,560
 Most of time we all start with scale of parameter the parameter is your it's a no it could be one scale one or it could be multiple so.

334
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,560
 In some of the methods the difference.

335
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,560
 And not much you can directly formulate the problem as the.

336
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:44,560
 Is a vector parameter but some of the method scale one is much easier and particularly for a more difficult topic like this CLP so we will start with.

337
00:41:44,560 --> 00:42:00,560
 Scalar parameter case and after that you know some techniques some like method some idea then you can extend to the so called magic case so the difference is scalar parameter typically you're dealing with.

338
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:08,560
 Scalar functions and you are not using magic the proof is also.

339
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:19,560
 Easier but once you go to vector parameter you need to have a good knowledge of magic linear algebra and that's why I prepared a pain to.

340
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:24,560
 You need to know that so for this course it's very.

341
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,560
 Very essential so the.

342
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,560
 Starting point is that we have those.

343
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,560
 You know data and then we assume.

344
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:49,560
 The data have this PDF for each of the data sample and then it also depend on scalar parameter K which is one scalar parameter.

345
00:42:49,560 --> 00:43:01,560
 So that we don't we don't have the technology of this to value but we only have the major data and we also know this data for all these.

346
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:09,560
 Distribution at the PDF for then to for CLP we also need to.

347
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,560
 For this function to satisfy the.

348
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,560
 Regularity condition so what's this.

349
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:32,560
 Very important regularity condition means you see we assume this is an analytic function the proper proper function you're right as later like exponential function depending on both X and C.

350
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:44,560
 Later you will see some example then being a PDF is always greater equal to zero is it probably density function cannot take negative negative value because some of the.

351
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:57,560
 Concepts are very important like variance you don't talk about negative negative value I think some some you know some undergraded student year or at least those taking.

352
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,560
 Signaling system because I have the tutorial class.

353
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:13,560
 Every every Tuesday yesterday and the beginning part now is also beginning of the of the semester we are doing a simple test every week.

354
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:26,560
 And some of the questions are asking energy type whether the signal is energy type or power type and the multiple multiple choice choice question there sometimes give negative value.

355
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:39,560
 They are all I told students if you choose negative value then I mean you are conceptually wrong because energy or power you'll never go down to negative at least zero or.

356
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:49,560
 Some positive value or infinity large and similarly here you know like you talk about barrier or talk about PDF then they will get the negative value.

357
00:44:49,560 --> 00:45:03,560
 Yeah so yeah so that's something very fundamental it's not negative you can take log a negative function negative value you cannot take log okay so once you take log function you can.

358
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:16,560
 Differentiate with respect to see that so doing it in two steps first take log and then second take the first order derivative and that's not the end.

359
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:30,560
 This regularly condition is because after you take that it depends on the data is still a random variable so you need to take expectation of this and.

360
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:44,560
 Therefore if this e of this whole thing equal to zero and as I say the theater can take over certain range of the of the value for all this data value is equal to zero.

361
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:57,560
 Then you will say it satisfy this regularity regularity condition and it's very important to take no weather you apply the e or not.

362
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:06,560
 Because later when you go to maximum likelihood estimation we are picking again the first order they made it by we do not apply it.

363
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:22,560
 Yeah so you can get e equal to this whole thing this whole thing go to zero for all the theater only when you apply e of this if you do not apply e you are not always equal to zero because it's.

364
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:36,560
 It will be a random variable is it so okay so that's the one year so assume this condition is satisfied and then our CLB you see we have a very famous.

365
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:50,560
 Results say the the variance of any unbiased estimator so remember from now on we are talking most we are dealing with unbiased estimate.

366
00:46:51,560 --> 00:47:04,560
 I'm by estimate they will there are many depending on which method you use you can get you know if you are you are good you you are very good just like you are going to to to to buy some.

367
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:26,560
 You know the bad on some some result for example few months ago this is a Europe football match you know they they disband actually I also participate is not the big money I I bet so maybe I learned this.

368
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:36,560
 Statistical symbol for saying so so I end up earning some money not not not big amount so I bet probably five or six match and it turned out to be.

369
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:43,560
 You know on the on the game side so that's yeah that's how.

370
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,560
 But I never know the outcome before the.

371
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:57,560
 For me it was for me it was play so I don't know the result is a random but still you can base on my knowledge is I study the past few.

372
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:11,560
 So so you see more likely you estimate the one okay so therefore again coming back to here you can have many different unbiased estimate.

373
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:25,560
 And then being a random variable it will surely have some some barrier so so we don't know how big this barrier different on by estimate they can have different.

374
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:41,560
 But what we know is if you your data your period satisfy this condition then you can always show the very of this must be greater or equal to either this one or.

375
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:53,560
 Or that one so I turn out to be this to this this to in the denominator are the same different post cause by the minus sign so the meaning of this is.

376
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:05,560
 But this one is you take the second order derivative is it second order then again you apply expectation and and then the other one is your.

377
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:20,560
 You take for so derivative and square it you see a random variable it can take positive negative value if we like in this case but we are quite sure if you.

378
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:42,560
 Squared it also follow our normal common sense like all the mess simple one whatever random variable of course we are dealing with the real random variable you make it power to you will become greater or equal to zero you can take random value still starting from zero all the way up to infinity.

379
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:56,560
 But you'll never go down to negative so that's something you also you should know it's random but it's there for all certain constant and that's how this pie is a very easy to very easy to understand and because.

380
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:10,560
 You're squaring already greater or equal to zero so you take expectation of course this value must be greater or equal to zero usually will be greater than zero only later we'll see the.

381
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:34,560
 A simtotic behavior when you have infinity large data but in normally will be a positive value so therefore very greater than one over positive value still greater than certain lower bound but this one is not so not so clear from here you can see the.

382
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:48,560
 You take the second order derivative which could be positive could be negative but however when you take expectation it will become always negative because why because after applying a negative.

383
00:50:49,560 --> 00:51:01,560
 You you you're applying the minus sign it becomes positive but this denominator are the same music from here they equal one over this but this one is a not so obvious this one is obvious.

384
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:12,560
 This one is you need to you need the right following this regularity condition and so go one of the very important results in the CLP.

385
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,560
 Okay.

386
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:27,560
 And and another important one is the derivative here we need to evaluate at the true value of of of theta.

387
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,560
 And the expectation of this quantity.

388
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,560
 Yeah.

389
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,560
 Yeah.

390
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:45,560
 As I say the formula is like that but normally you don't need to most of time you don't need to do the integration you can based on the given PDF and.

391
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:51,560
 Some of the popular one we already know the expectation equal to what.

392
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,560
 Yeah.

393
00:51:53,560 --> 00:52:03,560
 And of course the one always one you may naturally ask things we are going to estimate this we do not know the true value of theta so this result is not meaningful.

394
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:20,560
 Actually in saying is not is true theoretically but however is the is still very useful because we are the meat you see we do not know the true value of theta for a given probability.

395
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:30,560
 So we have a problem but quite often we know roughly the the range of these details you don't know the exact value.

396
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:50,560
 For example you have some circuit you probably know the DC value output will be maybe three volt it may not may not be exactly this river but it could be say between 2.5 to 3.5 then you can substitute the so called.

397
00:52:51,560 --> 00:53:04,560
 Estimate value into that to give the not the exact CRP but some estimate CRP and then you can also do it iteratively.

398
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:20,560
 The one get this power and then go back to better estimation and so so for now we're assuming we know this true value and that's that's even more important if you are doing simulation as it very often where we need to use.

399
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:33,560
 Training data is now you will apply machine learning train data is you already know the simulation data so we know the exact value there but we still need to.

400
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:57,560
 Test because this only give you the bow is not the estimation method itself so this bar shall be still useful because you can use it to to as a benchmark to measure how good any other and bias estimators is doing.

401
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,560
 Okay yeah.

402
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,560
 Yeah and then I think this is so.

403
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:18,560
 So that assume now how are we going to achieve this shall be say.

404
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,560
 Say.

405
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:41,560
 We have some and by estimator you see so now you be be careful if this first order derivative is it the one year not applying the expectation because once you apply expected expectation based on our assumption will become zero but this is the one.

406
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:55,560
 The one like in our case here is we're dealing with scale of parameter so it will be a schedule function if you can factorize as product of this to factor.

407
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:09,560
 Okay one is I of theta this is a scalar depending on it's a function depending on theta it doesn't depend on data is it then multiplied by another function depending on data only.

408
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:33,560
 So you see here this one is it depending on both data and unknown parameter so this is this is a function depending on X then you take the difference you become one factor and the other is a non factor if you can write in this way then your estimator is already the optimal and you achieve.

409
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:40,560
 You don't need to try any other estimate is already done and actually this condition is a.

410
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:54,560
 Necessarily and sufficient so if any and by estimator to achieve shall be it must be able to be written in written in this way also sometimes.

411
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:04,560
 You you're seeing your chief that but the very complicated very difficult to write like this way but if you're.

412
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:23,560
 For example the function is a very complicated you may not be simple example you can do but the very complicated one you may not be able to write that but if you are able to verify at least from last data say almost satisfied this is also fine.

413
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:44,560
 But but here we're talking about theoretical results say you are able to do that you're done on that thing if you claim your chief that you must show to myself show to other students you can write in that way and that's why later we use this condition to test on some.

414
00:56:45,560 --> 00:57:02,560
 Example some practical problem okay yeah at least some of the functions both are function but take care this function is only dependent data this function depends on this unknown parameter so it's a kind of decouple is it.

415
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:22,560
 So in this case it will be very good we're we're done and what's the envy of cause the one we're truly just just this this function remember our envy any estimate must depend on the data only because we are.

416
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:39,560
 Using the major data to do the job so we remember like last week we're talking about if you have to depend on the unknown parameter there will be no good so it's a functional data and it's already good because you see here this part you're putting.

417
00:57:40,560 --> 00:58:01,560
 It will be it will become become zero up to your take the expectation so it's it's show is is on bias of course only up to your take the expectation before taking expectation this is a random variable and they want is is a deterministic.

418
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:07,560
 Better but you can never be exactly equal to zero all the time.

419
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:18,560
 Okay and then for the more our minimum variance remember we're dealing with envy we the minimum very I just equal to the inverse of this I'll do.

420
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:34,560
 So that's very neat you know the result is one show able to do that then you're done you'll get the envy and at the same time you know how how big is this this better and in this case we call this I.

421
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,560
 So this I.

422
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,560
 It's a fish.

423
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,560
 I think I always miss a little bit.

424
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,560
 Yeah.

425
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,560
 Yeah.

426
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:47,560
 So this one is recording is the feature information.

427
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,560
 Yeah.

428
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:54,560
 Fisher is of course I think the mismatch isn't inventing this.

429
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:59,560
 Discovering this theory that's many years ago probably 100 years ago.

430
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:10,560
 And then the proof is giving the a pancake in the end of the chapter I always encourage students going back then try to follow this.

431
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:26,560
 A pancake if you understand every step there being able to do is a better you can you can do right at least in the in the schedule case then at least you'll get a good understanding of not just this part but some of the.

432
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:31,560
 Relating mess like calculus and how to do the partial.

433
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:36,560
 You know very very very deep or integration also.

434
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:45,560
 So it's quite useful but I see maybe I'll leave it to you.

435
00:59:45,560 --> 01:00:00,560
 Now this is a little bit further to what we discussed in last week about the pro to show the relationship about CLB and BLE and also those you'll see here.

436
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:07,560
 So if you look at that the assume this theta four hat.

437
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:17,560
 This is always the referring to the value is the lowest one for whatever any theta value comparing to the other.

438
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:22,560
 So this one is already the best achieve CLB.

439
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:31,560
 But assume we don't have Cedar four hat only we only estimate Cedar one hat Cedar two hat Cedar three hat.

440
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:44,560
 Then the CLB is here now if I erase this I only the CLB is with derived from some of the condition we don't have the estimate.

441
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:50,560
 I think we don't have Cedar four hat we only have Cedar one hat Cedar two hat Cedar three hat.

442
01:00:50,560 --> 01:01:03,560
 Then our Cedar three hat is is MBE of course we are assuming you don't have any other other estimate whatever you do all the unbiased.

443
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,560
 It's only Cedar one hat Cedar two hat Cedar three hat.

444
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,560
 So this is MBE but it is not an efficient one.

445
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:19,560
 It doesn't achieve the CLB not like Cedar four hat but it's MBE of course assuming you don't have Cedar four hat here.

446
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,560
 But Cedar four hat is better than Cedar three hat.

447
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:28,560
 I'm assuming now you only have only these three estimate.

448
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:37,560
 Then Cedar three hat is better consistently for all the Cedar value than Cedar two hat.

449
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:45,560
 But it's not efficient because it cannot achieve this CLB.

450
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:58,560
 There is a gap you see only when this the barrier of this estimate touching all the time to the CLB then it will recall that as an efficient one.

451
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:13,560
 Yeah so it must be its variance uniformly yeah MBE only require the variance uniformly less than that of other unbiased estimator.

452
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:28,560
 You have to exhaust all the other one but CLB the one efficient one must achieving that you are better than other not enough to be efficient.

453
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:33,560
 Just like for example again coming to the exam mark you see.

454
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:43,560
 So in the whole class the high is a mark for one student is 95.

455
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:50,560
 95 and all the other students in the class is less than that so this is the best student.

456
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:59,560
 But it's not perfect it's not 100 mark like one of my CLB then 95 you are only achieving the MBE.

457
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:08,560
 You are better than all the other and this one should apply to we're talking about like 10 courses.

458
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:21,560
 You want to have a better measurement among all the 10 courses this student must be in every course every course is every course of this 10 course is always higher than other.

459
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:35,560
 If you're a five course you are better mark in five courses but no I should go get some other student that you are not the theory degree or not the so called best best student.

460
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:47,560
 But you want to be efficient you must score like 100 or maybe eight eight plus depending on how you how your major.

461
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:52,560
 So that's the difference between these two.

462
01:03:52,560 --> 01:04:16,560
 Okay and yeah the NL College you know this feature information is no negative and also you can see is one over this feature information and larger the better the larger will give you the the barrier will be will be smaller.

463
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:37,560
 And then as I say this is always greater ecology low because for this one you're raised the power of two must be and this one is say say not so obvious but you can prove this also always negative and you take a negative minus side become positive.

464
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:42,560
 Okay we take some quick example and before take we'll take a break.

465
01:04:42,560 --> 01:05:05,560
 So again coming back to this very simple I will say this is the simplest example you cannot think about any simple example then this one so but later we will have more complicated one in this so this is very in a constant in white Gaussian noise and zero mean.

466
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:23,560
 Then to find the shall be be careful we need to get the like refunction and this is three of the like the PDF is depending on how you how you interpret that so you know so.

467
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:35,560
 So so you can see here PDF with respect if you are looking at the data is the random measure measurement then it will be PDF but you.

468
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:40,560
 Consider the data is fixed then you become like you function so.

469
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:49,560
 So now it's easier to assume each data sample for all the Gaussian distribution and the mean of this.

470
01:05:49,560 --> 01:06:03,560
 This noise is zero mean then the mean of this of course equal to a so so for each data you have this and because the noise is a Gaussian is why Gaussian noise not just.

471
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:14,560
 Gaussian noise is not enough Gaussian noise can be correlated what it means you see so they are independent so therefore you'll have.

472
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:30,560
 All this capital N sample the PDF will be the multiplication of each you see so that's a very basic result in probability so you multiply that and then.

473
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,560
 You can.

474
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:48,560
 You can simplify because exponential function if you multiply it will be summing up the exponent is it so then we remove this and this part you become.

475
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:57,560
 End product so you have the exponent of all the power of N here and.

476
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:11,560
 This is a square root of two this part and this one is you see here we will remove this product but then we become we are summing up this you see so don't don't.

477
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:17,560
 You can view this is each of them and this is capital N of them sum together.

478
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:37,560
 And now that you take the log you see so I won't go into detail how you derive this but you should be familiar this is also the basic requirement you should be familiar with this simple operation taking the log and then.

479
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:47,560
 After that this is a function of a you see a is our unknown parameter we want to estimate and take the first order derivative.

480
01:07:47,560 --> 01:08:03,560
 Okay so now here is a the result is a relatively simple so we managed to factorize this remember this is we don't take expectation you already being able to.

481
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:07,560
 Factualize so so see here.

482
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:18,559
 You'll have the sample mean here you see so this part is you're putting together divide by one over N divide by N you'll get this.

483
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,559
 Okay and then.

484
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:29,560
 After that this this is constant your sum capital N of a you'll become a multiply by a.

485
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:44,560
 Then of course you can pull out this common factor of N then you can you can see this one you can rely in this way so therefore this already me our.

486
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,560
 CLV you know the factorization.

487
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:54,560
 I raise up if you'll yeah if you'll compare with this energy.

488
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:05,560
 So of course this this function here it could be depending on the data cannot depend on data but it can be a constant you see it can be just.

489
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:20,560
 Constant is a special case of depending on data you see here as long as we do not have data in this part is okay and this one the other way it can depend on the depends on data but.

490
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,560
 Cannot depends on the a.

491
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:28,560
 So you can see yeah I'll raise out satisfy this.

492
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,560
 There's no a here but it's okay as long as no data.

493
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,560
 So in this case we are done.

494
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:56,560
 So want to see how are we going to verify the CLV you still need to yeah you can take the second order that you just want to just want to be sure what we actually get you're getting here you already get the CLV.

495
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:15,560
 Because you only need to take the inverse of that but then I want to be sure we go back to our formula for CLV by taking this you'll you'll you'll get the second derivative here is negative you see so as I say it's negative.

496
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:32,560
 Therefore you take the minus sign of this become a over sigma power to and inverse that you remember CLV you have to you have to flip this one one over this may become here and.

497
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:44,560
 And that happened to be on a CLV is here and our what we get the estimates also here it will be the same here this is if you flip this one this is I.

498
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:50,560
 And the CLV is one over I okay so that that verify.

499
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,560
 Our results here.

500
01:10:53,560 --> 01:11:07,560
 Okay then finally it's very important to do you should do it first to so-called check the regularity condition you see you must be sure you have this equal to a.

501
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:18,560
 But of course in this case very it's very easy this is what we already done before last week in the simple example where this.

502
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:30,560
 And it's already set by this form and then we had the phishing formation and MVV is given by that so it's all easily done.

503
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:48,560
 So that I think it's time to take a break before we continue into the next example so any question to ask I hope today I saw down a little bit compared to last week.

504
01:11:49,560 --> 01:12:10,560
 Or I big too fast anyway you can give me the give me the feedback during the during the break now is 742 we always look at the clock at the back so maybe we can come back at 8 o'clock we start the next.

505
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:21,560
 Next second half of the class always take one break only from a to nine plus finished.

506
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,560
 Okay so.

507
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,560
 So.

508
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:31,560
 Let me know if you have some difficulty or some question.

509
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,560
 So.

510
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:41,560
 I want students as a question I will later remember to answer that.

511
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,560
 Okay see you later.

512
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,560
 Oh.

513
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,560
 About the music you have.

514
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,560
 You have.

515
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,560
 You have.

516
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,560
 You have.

517
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,560
 Take it as a product is similar to some of the things you want to do.

518
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:33,560
 Product is a similar if I have everyone X and two X so this is a similar though you can be a product of I equal to say one to two.

519
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:37,560
 I X so the impact.

520
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,560
 This one this is.

521
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,560
 I think.

522
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,560
 The.

523
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,560
 I can't understand this point is.

524
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,560
 Okay.

525
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,560
 Each of the data we have.

526
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,560
 And some.

527
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,560
 Yes.

528
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:55,560
 Each data say X zero you have this.

529
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,560
 Yes.

530
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,560
 And then the next sample X one you follow.

531
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,560
 Also because.

532
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,560
 You have.

533
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,560
 Yes.

534
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,560
 Only.

535
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,560
 In the.

536
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,560
 In the.

537
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,560
 Yeah.

538
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,560
 That's how we say most of the.

539
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,560
 I.

540
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,560
 I.

541
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,560
 I.

542
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,560
 In the.

543
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,560
 Yeah.

544
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,560
 Yeah.

545
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,560
 Yeah.

546
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,560
 Yeah.

547
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,560
 Yeah.

548
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,560
 Yeah.

549
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,560
 Yeah.

550
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,560
 Yeah.

551
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,560
 Yeah.

552
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,560
 Yeah.

553
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,560
 Yeah.

554
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,560
 Minecraft.

555
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:28,560
 Yeah.

556
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,560
 Yeah.

557
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:30,560
 Yeah.

558
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,560
 You.

559
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,560
 So could for sure you got.

560
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,560
 Your health.

561
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,560
 If.

562
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,560
 If.

563
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:37,560
 You.

564
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,560
 If.

565
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,560
 Then.

566
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,560
 Each.

567
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,560
 Go.

568
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,560
 To.

569
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,560
 Go.

570
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,560
 Yeah.

571
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,560
brush.

572
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:46,560
 Yeah.

573
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,560
 Yeah.

574
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,560
 I do.

575
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,560
 следs.

576
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,560
 Yeah.

577
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,560
 So can do alye legendary.

578
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,560
 The.

579
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,560
 I don't.

580
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,560
 Get steep.

581
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,560
 You.

582
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,560
 Caught.

583
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,560
 Go very.

584
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:06,560
 Then normally your x-tinger doesn't knock the patient, then you're dead.

585
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:11,560
 But in this case you become equal. Equal is perfect. You can achieve it.

586
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:17,560
 But is this part definition, does this one of our patient's definition is the most...

587
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,560
 That's five, you can see on the test. One over this.

588
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:25,560
 And how you get here? I say normally, usually they have the full centralization.

589
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,560
 So you do it from the second one?

590
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,560
 No, the second one.

591
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,560
 So this is a definition. It's just a definition. That's not like the definition.

592
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,560
 The definition of the definition.

593
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:42,560
 Yeah, changing the pain, you can see how it is assuming the definition.

594
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,560
 Okay, but also for another question, we can ask you that.

595
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:03,560
 I want to ask you about this.

596
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:10,560
 So this specific experience, how do you know this?

597
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,560
 Oh, thank you.

598
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:21,560
 So you channel gaussian, again gaussian, if you have several gaussian people to do a submission,

599
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:28,560
 you will still be gaussian. So then in this sample data, they will be gaussian.

600
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:32,560
 For gaussian, you only need to know the mean and the variant.

601
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:40,560
 You can get the pdl. As I already showed, if you have sample mean,

602
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,560
 this sample mean itself is the mean of it.

603
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:50,560
 So we know the mean and the variant is the smaller.

604
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:59,560
 So this is the capital h.

605
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:04,560
 So there is a few assumptions.

606
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,560
 What's the definition?

607
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:13,560
 Also, do you speak in the traditional?

608
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:18,560
 No, this one, at this point, is just a normal period.

609
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:24,560
 You are putting the capital n sample together, collectively.

610
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,560
 It's a joint.

611
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,560
 Yeah, yes, yes.

612
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,560
 A is?

613
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:34,560
 A is deterministic, the constant.

614
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,560
 So please give it a value.

615
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:43,560
 No, no, no, don't confuse your conditional and the basic.

616
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,560
 Here, just a single a is just your mean data.

617
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:55,560
 When you measure data, the noise is a geomain, but since we have the DC, the mean becomes h.

618
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:01,560
 But then the data could be part a or below a.

619
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,560
 So it's just joint?

620
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:08,560
 Yes, yes, yes, it could be the joint data.

621
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,560
 What is the difference between the two?

622
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,560
 No, by the sample mean.

623
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:18,560
 No, no, no, no.

624
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:25,560
 The data is a, the sample mean.

625
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:33,560
 Yeah, the sample mean, the part is taking n sample n together.

626
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:38,560
 The knowledge is how, very typically, we have the sample mean.

627
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:43,560
 We are taking the mean of the sample, not the statistical mean.

628
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,560
 So the mean, mean, two things.

629
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,560
 One is the length and variable.

630
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,560
 The rest of the variable, the technicality, the many variables.

631
01:18:52,560 --> 01:19:00,560
 The sample mean is your measure, the data, each of the realizations.

632
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:08,560
 This question is patient, right?

633
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,560
 Oh, because it's, oh, that's a question.

634
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:20,560
 Because the variant, you know, our CRP is one over the, one over the.

635
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:27,560
 So you see the bigger one, then your file becomes smaller.

636
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:32,560
 So that means your variant becomes smaller.

637
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,560
 So again here, you know, if CRP becomes zero,

638
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:40,560
 it will have, they have very, very certain,

639
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,560
 so just larger the variant is more uncertain.

640
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:50,560
 Okay.

641
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,560
 That's the question.

642
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:58,560
 Because the question is real about, but it doesn't mean that we should be taking a million.

643
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,560
 So it was, it was a very interesting answer.

644
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:09,560
 Really, this question, we have the low, but it doesn't mean that we can take a million.

645
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,560
 No, no, no, no, no.

646
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:15,560
 The file itself is just like the benchmark.

647
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:22,560
 For example, we set the, then paper, 100, the idea benchmark.

648
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,560
 If you achieve that, it will be, it will be good.

649
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,560
 That part doesn't mean, must be one student achieving that.

650
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,560
 You just say that, the idea came.

651
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:41,560
 Yes, but no, it's possible.

652
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,560
 That's why we also discussed.

653
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:48,560
 Thanks for only telling you what you can, ideally what you can achieve.

654
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,560
 Doesn't mean you always achieve that one.

655
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:55,560
 But then, at least the comparison, 100, I already, you are,

656
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:00,560
 you are, you are to see the one closer, 95, better than 90.

657
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,560
 We know it's closer, like a one closer.

658
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,560
 I don't mean you must have someone to achieve that.

659
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,560
 Future under, sir.

660
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,560
 Yeah.

661
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:17,560
 So the question is, in this case, the rate is a three down one.

662
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,560
 Yes, yes, yes.

663
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,560
 So the rate is a two value?

664
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,560
 Yes.

665
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,560
 Yes, yes.

666
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,560
 A is a two value, A is a constant, constant value.

667
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:32,560
 From this equation, we try to devise the standard of study.

668
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,560
 Then we can't let the joy go away.

669
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:42,560
 That's a, actually it is from the assumption, for the noise that we need to, you know,

670
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,560
 assume this.

671
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,560
 You know what I mean, why can't we not?

672
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,560
 Yeah.

673
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,560
 Yeah.

674
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:55,560
 This one is the noise that you normally assume you follow certain issues.

675
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,560
 Or if not, you need to, you need to measure or to estimate the noise.

676
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:03,560
 That's another, another issue.

677
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,560
 Yeah.

678
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,560
 So it's another issue.

679
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:15,560
 Analyze is when we check the regularity condition after we get the concrete,

680
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:20,560
 the probability, the probability check, the regularity condition.

681
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:26,560
 Actually the regularity condition you should check first before you, because the regularity

682
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,560
 condition is, measure the condition you're looking at, the CLB.

683
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:39,560
 So you should, I think our next question of the example, maybe, it's okay.

684
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,560
 You always try to check the regularity condition.

685
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:48,560
 The one is easier to check when you're on the first order data and check each vector.

686
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,560
 Anyway, you all the KCRP, you have to take first order and second order.

687
01:22:53,560 --> 01:23:01,560
 So you take first order, you'll see, you can take the expected to see whether it gives

688
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:12,560
 you all the, you know, this, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

689
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:26,580
 the, the the real question is their

690
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:33,140
 same, they've been on the same order.

691
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:36,620
 Sometimes they get it wrong every day.

692
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:46,620
 I'm also proposing new projects because now a big short-haul project is very hard to

693
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:47,620
 do.

694
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:48,620
 Because I'm also quite limited.

695
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:49,620
 I cannot say that I don't think now I'm proposing a new project.

696
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:50,620
 Anyway, the deadline is also closing.

697
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:51,620
 So I'm not sure.

698
01:23:51,620 --> 01:24:16,620
 I'm sorry.

699
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:36,620
 Yeah, that's being this.

700
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,620
 This is being available.

701
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:40,620
 They only take hostage.

702
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:47,620
 It doesn't take negative value.

703
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:56,620
 It doesn't take negative value.

704
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,620
 It doesn't take negative value.

705
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:01,620
 It is being available only distributed on the right hand side.

706
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,620
 So it can't be zero.

707
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:08,620
 Okay, usually for continuous available, it doesn't matter.

708
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:23,620
 You can add zero usually into high square.

709
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:49,620
 Normally either you put the...

710
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:53,620
 You can try to hold it yourself.

711
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:57,620
 I know sometimes you go to the edge.

712
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:02,620
 I forgot the whole process.

713
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:10,620
 You can try out and see whether or you can look at the function.

714
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:15,620
 But normally for PDA, we don't care one particular value.

715
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:18,620
 So the PDA is not integrated.

716
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:23,620
 When you integrate one value, it doesn't matter.

717
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:28,620
 We will give you a zero.

718
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:40,620
 You will integrate only looking at the other one interval.

719
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:46,620
 We don't know this too very well.

720
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:51,620
 Now we are trying to define how good this A is.

721
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:58,620
 How good the A is to get the estimate.

722
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:01,620
 But A, the capillary, we don't know yet.

723
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:05,620
 Sometimes we may know it very quickly.

724
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:09,620
 But this is more like...

725
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:16,620
 We know the range is become like you are guessing your estimate.

726
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:24,620
 This is more like...

727
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:30,620
 I think this time I just show we are not looking to bias estimate.

728
01:29:35,620 --> 01:30:00,620
 Okay.

729
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:03,620
 So let's continue.

730
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:08,620
 I think quite a few students asking questions.

731
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:13,620
 If you have questions, you can clarify.

732
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:20,620
 Maybe I can share with you some of the discussion.

733
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:23,620
 It may be useful.

734
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:27,620
 Let's see.

735
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:32,620
 Now I try to...

736
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:38,620
 If you look at this product...

737
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:41,620
 The product intake, you will see.

738
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:47,620
 You will go back to this.

739
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:53,620
 Each of the data, the index, the angle to zero and so on.

740
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:56,620
 That means...

741
01:30:57,620 --> 01:31:03,620
 So angle to zero, we have one data sample X0.

742
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:10,620
 Because this is Gaussian, the noise Gaussian, the mean is become A.

743
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,620
 This is zero mean.

744
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:17,620
 So our mean of this random variable is equal to A.

745
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:23,620
 So you all have Gaussian distribution on one data.

746
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:27,620
 So you have corresponding to maybe one of the PDF here.

747
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:30,620
 And then you have the next one and become one.

748
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:33,620
 So A and zero and one.

749
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:37,620
 And then why we can multiply together because...

750
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:39,620
 Why Gaussian noise?

751
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:43,620
 If WN is zero mean, why Gaussian noise?

752
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:47,620
 Then W0, W1 and W2.

753
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:51,620
 All of them they are independent random variable.

754
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:55,620
 The joy period, it will be simply...

755
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:59,620
 You just simply multiply each of the PDF.

756
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:03,620
 But the condition must be why it mean they're independent.

757
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:10,620
 If we do not have white correlated, then the formula become much more complicated.

758
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:15,620
 For Gaussian, you can still get joy period.

759
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:18,620
 But you will have so-called costum.

760
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:21,620
 You will look at the matrix.

761
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:26,620
 So white Gaussian noise being the matrix is diagonal matrix.

762
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:28,620
 You don't have the off-diagonal term.

763
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:31,620
 Then you can simply multiply together.

764
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:36,620
 And then coming to the exponent, maybe I can also A here.

765
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:42,620
 I think this is also a very common useful property.

766
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:47,620
 If I had E to the power A, I multiply E to the power B.

767
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:51,620
 Because it will become E, A plus B.

768
01:32:51,620 --> 01:32:55,620
 So this is how you...

769
01:32:55,620 --> 01:33:04,620
 For exponential function, you convert product into one simple exponential function.

770
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:07,620
 But you are summing up the exponent.

771
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:14,620
 And that's also why here we are dealing mostly with PDF with exponential function.

772
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:19,620
 Like Gaussian or later you have exponential distribution.

773
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:25,620
 And for exponential function, it's easier to take log.

774
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:30,620
 Once you take log, you will be only working on the exponent.

775
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:36,620
 So all these are very basic, you know, the max property.

776
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:37,620
 And I hope that you...

777
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,620
 Max result.

778
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,620
 I hope that you know that.

779
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:42,620
 But anyway, don't worry.

780
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:49,620
 Later on, we keep showing examples in the assignment to be given to you.

781
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:57,620
 You'll be doing some Hang-Song exercises, solving questions by yourself.

782
01:33:57,620 --> 01:33:58,620
 Okay?

783
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:01,620
 So let's...

784
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:09,620
 Yeah, let's continue coming into the next example.

785
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:18,620
 So the example here is a little bit more complicated, compared to the previous one.

786
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:23,620
 You see, there previously we only A plus this.

787
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:25,620
 But now we...

788
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:36,620
 Something like the DC value, the deterministic part here, it becomes like...

789
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:40,620
 What I said earlier, it's no longer a constant.

790
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:45,620
 For each of the n-measure data, it depends on n.

791
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:52,620
 It will take a different value, but it's still deterministic.

792
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:58,620
 So this side, from here, we have some unknown...

793
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:00,620
 So several variable here.

794
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:02,620
 We will be here.

795
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:04,620
 We only want to estimate the phase.

796
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:06,620
 So this is the one.

797
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:08,620
 The two values we don't know.

798
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:11,620
 The other are constant, A and F0.

799
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:13,620
 They are assuming to be known.

800
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:15,620
 Okay.

801
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:23,620
 So now our...

802
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:25,620
 Which one we are going to...

803
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:28,620
 Yeah, by the way, I think probably a mistake.

804
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:30,620
 This should be...

805
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:32,620
 Now should be...

806
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:34,620
 Because the phase...

807
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:36,620
 We want to estimate the phase.

808
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:42,620
 So I guess I think this one should be changed to phase 5.

809
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:52,620
 So anyway, let's just replace with the previous example, with this whole thing, into the mean value.

810
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:56,620
 Because each of the data samples still follow Gaussian.

811
01:35:56,620 --> 01:36:01,620
 And this is the one random, where this one is the mean.

812
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:12,620
 And then from here, similar to the previous example, you convert the product into one simple exponential function.

813
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:15,620
 Then you sum this.

814
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:23,620
 Now after that, you take the first derivative of the log likelihood function.

815
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:29,620
 And then here, it's very hard to prove.

816
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:36,620
 But then on that thing, just the counter question is...

817
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:42,620
 The question to ask is, are you able to show...

818
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:44,620
 Rely on this whole thing?

819
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:49,620
 It looks very complicated as this simple form, like our previous example.

820
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:52,620
 Our previous example, we can do it in this way.

821
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:57,620
 Remember, as I said, this one is correct, changed to phase.

822
01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:11,620
 So therefore, we say almost impossible because you are involving some nonlinear function of this data here.

823
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:21,620
 You can try to find a function depending on X zeta, but then it's like highly coupled here.

824
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:25,620
 So there's nowhere you cannot do it this way.

825
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,620
 Or on that thing, you show me.

826
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:28,620
 I say no.

827
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:35,620
 If you say yes, you should try to show me right in that way.

828
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:38,620
 We say no, not possible.

829
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:44,620
 So therefore, in this case, we see the CLB is not achieved.

830
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:46,620
 We cannot achieve the CLB.

831
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:49,620
 That means we cannot estimate this.

832
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:56,620
 We cannot find a measure to estimate this data to meet this CLB.

833
01:37:56,620 --> 01:38:05,620
 But here, as I mentioned earlier, it doesn't mean the MBE is not there.

834
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:13,620
 We may still have the possibility to have the MBE, except there will be a gap here.

835
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:21,620
 And then in this case, we cannot use the CLB measure to find it.

836
01:38:21,620 --> 01:38:31,620
 So we'll see in this more difficult situation, how are we going to think?

837
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:33,620
 We try to get the CLB first.

838
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:38,620
 We derive the second order derivative here.

839
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:46,620
 And then I assume you're familiar with how to do the derivative from first one,

840
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:53,620
 first derivative to second one, but continue to take the derivative with respect to this five here.

841
01:38:53,620 --> 01:38:56,620
 So this is what you'll get.

842
01:38:56,620 --> 01:39:05,620
 And then you may simplify using a little bit of the trigonometric identity.

843
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:13,620
 And then now after that, you'll take the expectation, and then after that, take the negative side.

844
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:18,620
 So again, this part is not difficult.

845
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:27,620
 And then, as I say, you may make good use of the trigonometric identity to simplify in this form.

846
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:33,620
 Cosine of this part of two is relative to the...

847
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:36,620
 This argument is... This one is twice of that.

848
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:43,620
 So you can try to remember, try to use that formula.

849
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:53,620
 Now this part is still a little bit complicated because we are involving this one.

850
01:39:53,620 --> 01:40:03,620
 But then you can show this part here.

851
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,620
 This one we have two.

852
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:08,620
 You can see inside the summation, we have two terms here.

853
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:10,620
 One is a constant one.

854
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:13,620
 Then of course, this is very easy.

855
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:18,620
 Just sum all the one together, you will be capital N.

856
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:20,620
 So that's how we become this.

857
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:26,620
 So the more difficult question is how are we summing this one because this is a functional thing.

858
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:31,620
 So we write here.

859
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:46,620
 You can show this part is approximately equal to zero under some condition.

860
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:49,620
 The first is this F0.

861
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:54,620
 This frequency is not very near zero or half.

862
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:58,620
 Because we are talking about digital frequency.

863
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:03,620
 So it becomes zero up to half over this range.

864
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:07,620
 And furthermore, this N will be large.

865
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:13,620
 So that means you are taking many samples here.

866
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:23,620
 You can prove that by using some mass proof.

867
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,620
 It can be a little bit complicated.

868
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:33,620
 But I can try to helistically show why this sum was big one, approximately zero.

869
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:39,620
 First, why we say F0 is not near zero or equal to half?

870
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:52,620
 Because if you make F0 equal to zero, then this will become cosine zero plus two phi.

871
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:56,620
 Then it will be always a constant.

872
01:41:56,620 --> 01:42:02,620
 And constant, depending on the value of phi, it will not be not equal to zero.

873
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:07,620
 Then of course, your sum N of N will not be equal to zero.

874
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:15,620
 Similarly, if F0 becomes one over two, half, then you will get similar argument here.

875
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:19,620
 But now why not near these two values?

876
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:25,620
 Then why you can get the sum almost equal to zero?

877
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:34,620
 So let me, in the normal case, F0 not near the edge, it will be a proper digital frequency.

878
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:41,620
 That means this cosine function is a proper cosine curve.

879
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:49,620
 So see here, if this capital N is large enough,

880
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:58,620
 you will be trying to take the mean value of cosine function.

881
01:42:58,620 --> 01:43:06,620
 And then if you are, you know, if the cosine function, in the extreme case, F0 equal to zero or one over two,

882
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:08,620
 you will become a constant line.

883
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:10,620
 Of course, this doesn't apply.

884
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:16,620
 But if you have a proper cosine function, and just imagine cosine function,

885
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:24,620
 theoretically, if you are infinity, some of them you have some one period of cosine equal to zero, some two period of cosine equal to zero.

886
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:29,620
 But if N is large enough, then most of the, you will be still adding up,

887
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:32,620
 it will be approximately equal to zero.

888
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:37,620
 So that's how we need that condition.

889
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:42,620
 If you all, as many of you have proved that, you will become, you're looking at something like a sin function.

890
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:50,620
 A sin function is equal to be most of the equal to zero except at the peak there.

891
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:55,620
 So we won't go into detail.

892
01:43:55,620 --> 01:44:08,620
 And then once you satisfy this, then our CLB, in this case, you just take the inverse based on our CLB condition.

893
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:14,620
 You reverse this, you'll get this.

894
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:25,620
 So that means here is, we can still get CLB, even so we do not achieve this efficient estimate.

895
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:32,620
 And now we continue into a more general case.

896
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:39,620
 Following our previous example, you can extend into this still deterministic signal.

897
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:43,620
 And then we say unknown parameter in white Gaussian noise.

898
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:46,620
 So that's, yeah.

899
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:55,620
 So everything is similar to previous one, except now this so-called TC value here becomes the function of this S,

900
01:44:55,620 --> 01:45:03,620
 depending on N, the intact N, therefore we have this.

901
01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:13,620
 And then I hope you know this so-called train rules, how to take the derivatives, first derivative, you'll get this.

902
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:15,620
 Because now we do not know this function.

903
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:21,620
 So you can only put this first derivative here.

904
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:23,620
 This is function of zeta.

905
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:26,620
 And after that you take the second derivative.

906
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:33,620
 And this is a bit complicated because you have to consider this is function zeta.

907
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:35,620
 This is also another one.

908
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:41,620
 That's how this one, however complicated, you can follow the train rules to do derivative.

909
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:47,620
 So it's not as complicated as you are doing the integration.

910
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:56,620
 And after that you can usually, before apply expectation, it looks complicated.

911
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:59,620
 But quite often you apply expectation.

912
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:11,620
 You can simplify quite a few of the result because depending on, you see the expectation.

913
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:16,620
 So you can see, you take expectation, take the negative side.

914
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:21,620
 Which term we are keeping here?

915
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:25,620
 You can see we are keeping only this term.

916
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:28,620
 Why this term and that term can so.

917
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:35,620
 So that's how this calls both detection pying estimation.

918
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:39,620
 It's very important and very useful.

919
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:41,620
 You need to know how to simplify.

920
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:49,620
 For example, if they say in the exams or even the home war assignment.

921
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:53,620
 You cannot say I stay here, then it's done.

922
01:46:53,620 --> 01:47:00,620
 You see, before taking expectation, we are not able to simplify further.

923
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:06,620
 But once you take expectation, you have to see some of the term maybe.

924
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:10,620
 So they cannot say, oh, I just put e into each of these.

925
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:13,620
 Because you see why?

926
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:18,620
 E of this x of n equal to what?

927
01:47:18,620 --> 01:47:22,620
 It will be just equal to s of n theta.

928
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:26,620
 So you will go back to the, you see, e of this.

929
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:29,620
 It will be e of this one and e of this.

930
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:31,620
 But this is zero mean.

931
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:34,620
 So taking expectation, this becomes zero.

932
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:39,620
 And take expectation, this one is not random.

933
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:43,620
 So it will become like the DC term here.

934
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:50,620
 And that's how after applying this e, this one becomes s of n theta.

935
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:52,620
 And this factor is the same.

936
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:55,620
 But they have positive side, negative side.

937
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:57,620
 Of course, these two can so.

938
01:47:57,620 --> 01:48:00,620
 So all the n dot is only this one.

939
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:04,620
 So that's how it becomes much simpler.

940
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:05,620
 Okay?

941
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:13,620
 So I hope you know how to handle this kind of derivations and simplification.

942
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:17,620
 And then after that, we know, you know, also useful.

943
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:22,620
 This one is, must be greater or equal to zero.

944
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:27,620
 Because you are, this is not the second derivative.

945
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:29,620
 This one is the second derivative.

946
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:34,620
 But this is the first derivative, power of two.

947
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:39,620
 Then must be, this term must be greater or equal to zero.

948
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:40,620
 Okay?

949
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:41,620
 So it cannot be negative.

950
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:45,620
 So, and then you are summing up all the non-negative number.

951
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:48,620
 Because become non-negative value.

952
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:52,620
 So you can use that as CLB.

953
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:55,620
 So we say CLB actually the power here.

954
01:48:55,620 --> 01:48:58,620
 And this is just the relationship.

955
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:06,620
 So any estimate, the variance must be greater or equal to inverting this one.

956
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:07,620
 Yeah.

957
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:08,620
 Okay?

958
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:16,620
 So that's how you get this more general result.

959
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:24,620
 But again here, we are, actually we are not doing the proper right step.

960
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:29,620
 The right step is maybe in subsequent examples.

961
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:39,620
 So always remember, before even you do the CLB, you need to check this regularity condition.

962
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:40,620
 You see?

963
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:48,620
 So in our case here, let's go back to the regularity condition again.

964
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:49,620
 You see?

965
01:49:49,620 --> 01:49:52,620
 Now this is the first derivative.

966
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:57,620
 And then if you apply E of this here, so what do we get?

967
01:49:57,620 --> 01:50:02,620
 You're, because expectation is a linear operation.

968
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:07,620
 So you'll be bringing this E into this.

969
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:09,620
 This is not random.

970
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:12,620
 So we'll have E of this exchange.

971
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:15,620
 It becomes SN of this.

972
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:21,620
 So basically this is become like zero.

973
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:35,620
 But the assumption is if this is finite value, as long as no infinity lasts, then we are done.

974
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:40,620
 Zero multiplied with finite value still becomes zero.

975
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:43,620
 Then your sum of the zero becomes zero.

976
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:54,620
 But however, if this is not finite, you know, our sum of these so-called waveforms or the signal here.

977
01:50:54,620 --> 01:51:00,620
 For example, in the case I mentioned the application, we are talking about radar.

978
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:07,620
 And sometimes you're sending out square weight.

979
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:11,620
 And square weight is a proper signal.

980
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:14,620
 Also, theoretically, we don't have square weight.

981
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:22,620
 But then if your signal is very close to this amplitude, it may have this continuity.

982
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:25,620
 It becomes suddenly like the unit step function.

983
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:27,620
 It becomes from zero to one.

984
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:33,620
 Then in that case, you see, you are taking the first derivative.

985
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:34,620
 It becomes infinity.

986
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:36,620
 Then we have problem.

987
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:42,620
 Also, one factor here is zero.

988
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:48,620
 If you multiply infinity large values, you cannot say it becomes zero.

989
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:50,620
 Zero multiplied by infinity.

990
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:53,620
 In mass, you say this is undetermined.

991
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:55,620
 We cannot say where there is.

992
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:57,620
 It can become zero.

993
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:58,620
 It can be a constant.

994
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:00,620
 It can be infinity large.

995
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:03,620
 So that's a problem here.

996
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:17,620
 So that's why I say in practical application, it's always important to check to see whether this can be applied or not.

997
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:19,620
 Okay?

998
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:21,620
 So that's...

999
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:27,620
 Finally, we come to another example.

1000
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:35,620
 So again, we are still in the same discussion, continue.

1001
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:39,620
 But now, S n of theta still the same function.

1002
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:47,620
 But here is the amplitude A here, and the phase assumed to be known.

1003
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:51,620
 So what's unknown is the digital frequency here.

1004
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:53,620
 So what happened here?

1005
01:52:53,620 --> 01:53:02,620
 Using what the result we derived earlier, we can see the COV become this inverse of that.

1006
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:12,620
 But they will have a problem if you think about assuming the phase equal to zero,

1007
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:16,620
 then the F zero is near the edge, as I mentioned earlier.

1008
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:21,620
 So this edge is either zero or 0.5.

1009
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:23,620
 Then what happened?

1010
01:53:23,620 --> 01:53:27,620
 These signs of this zero become zero.

1011
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:34,620
 So in this case, the variance become infinity large or very, very large.

1012
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:40,620
 So a random variable, a variable become very large.

1013
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:45,620
 That means we don't know much about this random variable, you see.

1014
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:49,620
 So basically it's totally uncertain, you see.

1015
01:53:49,620 --> 01:53:55,620
 So it's not very useful here.

1016
01:53:55,620 --> 01:54:02,620
 We are talking about say the variance is as large as infinity large.

1017
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:08,620
 So I mean, basically we are saying this estimate is not good.

1018
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:10,620
 No use.

1019
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:12,620
 Variance is so large.

1020
01:54:12,620 --> 01:54:17,620
 In one situation, ideal one is a very small variable or near zero.

1021
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:25,620
 But on the other side, if the variance is infinity large, I mean, it's almost no use.

1022
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:31,620
 So that's the case of your...

1023
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:36,620
 It's similar to what we say early in the edge situation.

1024
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:46,620
 We don't know or we cannot estimate this frequency because they are very, very uncertain.

1025
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:50,620
 The CLB is too large, infinity large.

1026
01:54:50,620 --> 01:55:05,620
 So any questions before we move on to the CLB for the vector parameter case?

1027
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:20,620
 So the idea, the results are similar except you need to get familiar with magic, linear algebraic.

1028
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:32,620
 So I already uploaded some basic results or properties of linear algebraic or magic.

1029
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:36,620
 So I hope you can take a look and try to get familiar.

1030
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:46,620
 Because in the subsequent lecture, we also need some magic theory or linear algebraic.

1031
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:49,620
 So let's come back to our question here.

1032
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:53,620
 The regularity condition is similar.

1033
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:58,620
 Please take note, you see our so-called PDF here.

1034
01:55:58,620 --> 01:56:01,620
 We are... our joy PDF, when we say...

1035
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:05,620
 Because we are taking, usually, multiple data samples.

1036
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:16,620
 And we assume the data independence measure so you can simply multiply the PDF of each data sample.

1037
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:24,620
 So in this case, even the unknown parameter, you have more than one, so it's two or multiple.

1038
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:30,620
 This PDF, except it will still be a scalar function.

1039
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:34,620
 It will not become... it will not become a vector.

1040
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:39,620
 Don't get confused with this.

1041
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:43,620
 But however, the theta itself is a vector.

1042
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:45,620
 Now it's a vector.

1043
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:57,620
 So therefore, if you have a scalar, you take derivative with respect to several variables.

1044
01:56:57,620 --> 01:56:59,620
 So what do we get?

1045
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:03,620
 Our derivative will become a vector derivative.

1046
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:09,620
 It will be something like... let's show it here.

1047
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:11,620
 Let's see.

1048
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:22,620
 Okay, you will be... you know, you put it here.

1049
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:27,620
 I can... you see, this is a function.

1050
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:34,620
 It depends on, say, both phase vectors.

1051
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:41,620
 So therefore, you... each of the elements, theta1, you get one derivative.

1052
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:48,620
 Then you'll do the same for theta2 and so on.

1053
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:58,620
 In total, you'll have thetaM, you see.

1054
01:57:58,620 --> 01:58:06,620
 So you'll just list them together into a proper vector.

1055
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:09,620
 Okay.

1056
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:19,620
 And then similarly, you... after that, you apply the expectation into this so-called random vector.

1057
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:25,620
 It must be zero for each of these elements after applying the expectation.

1058
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:26,620
 Okay.

1059
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:29,620
 Where you see theta1, theta2, and so on.

1060
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:32,620
 And each takes certain range.

1061
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:34,620
 Okay.

1062
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:41,620
 Now, in this case, what shall be or what condition we will have?

1063
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:51,620
 We need to look at the covariance matrix of any unbiased S-dimeter mass satisfi...

1064
01:58:51,620 --> 01:58:54,620
 You see, we... this is a vector.

1065
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:58,620
 For scalar, we use a barrier.

1066
01:58:58,620 --> 01:58:59,620
 No.

1067
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:07,620
 But if you have more than one, you become a vector, then you need to use covariance... covariance matrix.

1068
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:20,620
 The diagonal one is with respect to the variance of each of the... each of the parameter... parameter element,

1069
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:26,620
 where the cross term is... you can have the correlations.

1070
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:27,620
 Okay.

1071
01:59:27,620 --> 01:59:34,620
 So... and also here, you need to be familiar with this matrix operator.

1072
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:43,620
 This... this is one matrix, the so-called covariance matrix, referring to this theta hat.

1073
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:46,620
 You know, we have the random vector.

1074
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:50,620
 And then this is the feature information matrix.

1075
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:51,620
 You see?

1076
01:59:51,620 --> 01:59:55,620
 The early on, we talked about feature information, which is a scalar.

1077
01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:58,620
 Now, we are dealing with vector parameter.

1078
01:59:58,620 --> 02:00:05,620
 You have everything you have to extend to a vector matrix, and the term also changes.

1079
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:06,620
 Okay.

1080
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:11,620
 So, a matrix, minus another matrix, and make sure this is inverse of this.

1081
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:13,620
 How to define this?

1082
02:00:13,620 --> 02:00:14,620
 We'll say later.

1083
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:23,620
 But this symbol is not our... our convention mean of... you are talking about the numbers.

1084
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:28,620
 So, the vector equal... equal, this mean the matrix.

1085
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:31,620
 This matrix, you take the difference.

1086
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:35,620
 Together is a positive semi-definite.

1087
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:47,620
 So, you know, I guess you all know how to define... what's it mean by positive semi-definite matrix.

1088
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:53,620
 So, if I cannot, then maybe next week I can do a little bit of revision on the linear algebra.

1089
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:55,620
 This is very important.

1090
02:00:55,620 --> 02:01:06,620
 And then how about if I change greater or equal into greater without equal, it will be positive definite.

1091
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:11,620
 You know, semi means it includes the... possibly includes this equal.

1092
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:16,620
 So, if you only have greater, then it will be positive definite.

1093
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:19,620
 And how about this i theta?

1094
02:01:19,620 --> 02:01:21,620
 This is m by m, you see.

1095
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:25,620
 We have in total capital N parameter.

1096
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:31,620
 This is future information matrix whose element are given by...

1097
02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:44,620
 So, you see here, we have second order derivative, but depending on whether theta i and j are the same or not, you see.

1098
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:47,620
 i, you know, you have more than one.

1099
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:49,620
 So, it could be one and two.

1100
02:01:49,620 --> 02:01:56,620
 And of course, it will be... you take derivative with respect to say theta one first.

1101
02:01:56,620 --> 02:02:00,620
 And after that, you take another derivative with respect to theta two.

1102
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:03,620
 Or vice versa, because these are the same.

1103
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:07,620
 You know, this order doesn't matter.

1104
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:10,620
 Okay?

1105
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:14,620
 Then furthermore, this is the second derivative.

1106
02:02:14,620 --> 02:02:19,620
 You take the expectation and must apply the negative sign here.

1107
02:02:19,620 --> 02:02:25,620
 Or you can... you see, this is the element.

1108
02:02:25,620 --> 02:02:34,620
 You can take the first derivative with respect to j theta i, and then multiply another derivative with respect to j theta j.

1109
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:40,620
 So, this is the multiplication of two first derivatives.

1110
02:02:40,620 --> 02:02:47,620
 This one is you're taking the second derivative, one, then after the other.

1111
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:49,620
 So, don't confuse these two, you see.

1112
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:51,620
 They are different.

1113
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:52,620
 Okay?

1114
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:54,620
 Just like early on, we are talking about scale k.

1115
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:59,620
 You take first derivative, then make a power of two.

1116
02:02:59,620 --> 02:03:00,620
 Okay?

1117
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:05,620
 And it's different from you take a second derivative.

1118
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:08,620
 So, that's the...

1119
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:15,620
 And you can see this is just an extension of our scalar parameter case.

1120
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:16,620
 Okay?

1121
02:03:16,620 --> 02:03:23,620
 And then you follow from that.

1122
02:03:23,620 --> 02:03:27,620
 And so, you can see here, you see.

1123
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:34,620
 So, another property is for positive semi-definite matrix.

1124
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:38,620
 Remember, this means this matrix, positive semi-definite.

1125
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:47,620
 Then, we cannot say much about the off-diagonal element, but there is a property.

1126
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:55,620
 You can be sure these diagonal elements, it must be greater or equal to zero.

1127
02:03:55,620 --> 02:03:57,620
 It can never be negative value.

1128
02:03:57,620 --> 02:03:58,620
 Okay?

1129
02:03:58,620 --> 02:04:01,620
 So, you see here, this is the matrix.

1130
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:09,620
 And this, the subscript here, ii, I mean, you are just looking at the diagonal element

1131
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:14,620
 at the one, one, or two, two, or three, three.

1132
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:16,620
 You know, the same ii.

1133
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:17,620
 Okay?

1134
02:04:18,620 --> 02:04:27,620
 And in the case of your taking positive definite, say greater than zero, then you also accordingly

1135
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:32,620
 you change it to greater than zero.

1136
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:37,620
 So therefore, you see, looking at this, we cannot conclude from here, but just looking

1137
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:44,620
 at the diagonal element, you see, because what our value of each is, it's more important

1138
02:04:44,620 --> 02:04:48,620
 that we only need the diagonal element here.

1139
02:04:48,620 --> 02:04:53,620
 Because from here, we can see the value, you see, the diagonal element here.

1140
02:04:53,620 --> 02:04:59,620
 Now, we are looking at each of the diagonal elements.

1141
02:04:59,620 --> 02:05:01,620
 You will be a scalar.

1142
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:08,620
 So, you can simply say this is the value of this data i hat.

1143
02:05:08,620 --> 02:05:11,620
 It could be one, two, three, and so on.

1144
02:05:11,620 --> 02:05:14,620
 It must be greater or equal to that.

1145
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:17,620
 This is a normal common sense of numbers.

1146
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:21,620
 You can talk about three is greater than two.

1147
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:24,620
 Or you can say three is greater or equal to two.

1148
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:25,620
 It doesn't matter.

1149
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:29,620
 It includes both greater and equal.

1150
02:05:29,620 --> 02:05:30,620
 Yeah.

1151
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:38,620
 So we, anyway, in this case, we get the similar result with our scalar case.

1152
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:39,620
 Yeah.

1153
02:05:39,620 --> 02:05:41,620
 But it's a little bit more in both.

1154
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:47,620
 You have to get the whole matrix first, invert the matrix, and after that, you are getting

1155
02:05:47,620 --> 02:05:48,620
 that.

1156
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:54,620
 You cannot say I just look at the i theta and take the inverse of each of the elements.

1157
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:58,620
 This is the result, in general, not the same.

1158
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:05,620
 Except if the official information matrix is diagonal, diagonal matrix.

1159
02:06:05,620 --> 02:06:06,620
 Yeah.

1160
02:06:06,620 --> 02:06:18,620
 Actually, there is some past year paper showing the difference between inverse first, take

1161
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:21,620
 the diagonal element, or you don't inverse.

1162
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:24,620
 You directly take the inverse of each of the elements.

1163
02:06:24,620 --> 02:06:27,620
 They will be different in general.

1164
02:06:27,620 --> 02:06:28,620
 Okay.

1165
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:34,620
 Then after that, we have a similar result as what we showed before.

1166
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:38,620
 We will say if and only if.

1167
02:06:38,620 --> 02:06:44,620
 Then you need to be able to factorize this first derivative.

1168
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:48,620
 Again, as a product, but now it's more complicated.

1169
02:06:48,620 --> 02:06:50,620
 The product of what?

1170
02:06:50,620 --> 02:06:54,620
 Product of official information matrix.

1171
02:06:54,620 --> 02:06:55,620
 This is a matrix.

1172
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:59,620
 And this is a vector, because this is a vector.

1173
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:07,620
 So a matrix multiplied by a vector, it will become still the same vector.

1174
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:13,620
 Of course, we assume this matrix must be a square matrix.

1175
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:15,620
 Okay.

1176
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:17,620
 Then we start.

1177
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:19,620
 What next?

1178
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:25,620
 You see, so the result here is similar to what we discussed earlier.

1179
02:07:26,620 --> 02:07:28,620
 Assume we can do that.

1180
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:31,620
 Then we already done, you see.

1181
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:35,620
 But pay attention.

1182
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:41,620
 This is vector function, you see, depending on the data only.

1183
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:46,620
 Where this matrix is depending on the data only.

1184
02:07:46,620 --> 02:07:50,620
 Or of course, it can be just a constant matrix.

1185
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:54,620
 But as long as it doesn't depend on the data, it's fine.

1186
02:07:54,620 --> 02:07:56,620
 Okay.

1187
02:07:56,620 --> 02:08:00,620
 And then after that, we are done, you see.

1188
02:08:00,620 --> 02:08:08,620
 Our MBE, actually this one, not just MBE, is also an efficient estimate.

1189
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:11,620
 It's given by this, simply this function.

1190
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:13,620
 And this makes sense.

1191
02:08:13,620 --> 02:08:15,620
 It depends on the data only.

1192
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:16,620
 Okay.

1193
02:08:16,620 --> 02:08:19,620
 Not depending on the unknown parameter.

1194
02:08:19,620 --> 02:08:21,620
 Okay.

1195
02:08:21,620 --> 02:08:27,620
 Furthermore, the covariant matrix, just take the inverse of this.

1196
02:08:27,620 --> 02:08:31,620
 Again, the proof you can see in the appendix.

1197
02:08:31,620 --> 02:08:36,620
 But I will say this is a much more difficult one.

1198
02:08:36,620 --> 02:08:43,620
 If you can figure out by yourself and prove every step of this matrix case,

1199
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:51,620
 you are probably, you don't need to come to study this course.

1200
02:08:51,620 --> 02:08:56,620
 Because that will contain quite a few difficult parts into that.

1201
02:08:56,620 --> 02:08:58,620
 Okay.

1202
02:08:58,620 --> 02:08:59,620
 I forgot.

1203
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:04,620
 Or I will say you can save, study by yourself without any problem.

1204
02:09:04,620 --> 02:09:08,620
 Again, we come back to an example.

1205
02:09:08,620 --> 02:09:13,620
 This is a matrix case.

1206
02:09:13,620 --> 02:09:19,620
 We are dealing with two unknown parameters, A and B.

1207
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:23,620
 And then this is line fitting.

1208
02:09:23,620 --> 02:09:30,620
 I mean, instead of, you see, previously we are looking at just one constant.

1209
02:09:30,620 --> 02:09:34,620
 Now we add this linear term.

1210
02:09:34,620 --> 02:09:38,620
 This, if you think about this, it's a DC.

1211
02:09:38,620 --> 02:09:43,620
 And the DC itself is, it's got to be a straight line.

1212
02:09:43,620 --> 02:09:46,620
 It's a linear depending on N.

1213
02:09:46,620 --> 02:09:50,620
 N increased from 0, 1, 2, and so on.

1214
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:57,620
 So this whole value, it will increase linearly.

1215
02:09:57,620 --> 02:09:59,620
 That's it.

1216
02:10:00,620 --> 02:10:08,620
 So again, we follow similar derivation in this part.

1217
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:16,620
 And now we have two unknown, you see, parameters put together as a vector.

1218
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:19,620
 And so this one is the same as before.

1219
02:10:19,620 --> 02:10:23,620
 You see, except now you see our so-called mean value here.

1220
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:30,620
 So you have to take each of the N, you replace by A plus BN.

1221
02:10:30,620 --> 02:10:38,620
 And then again, you have to be careful because here we have two unknown parameters.

1222
02:10:38,620 --> 02:10:49,620
 So you need to take the first derivative with respect to A and B respectively.

1223
02:10:49,620 --> 02:11:03,620
 So let's look at the regularity condition first before we go further.

1224
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:09,620
 So here, if we take expectation of this one.

1225
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:11,620
 So what do we get?

1226
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:14,620
 So we get a prime expectation.

1227
02:11:14,620 --> 02:11:18,620
 Then our, you know, this is a linear operator.

1228
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:20,620
 You're bringing this summation.

1229
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:24,620
 Then E of this XN is equal to A plus BA.

1230
02:11:24,620 --> 02:11:26,620
 This is 0 mean.

1231
02:11:26,620 --> 02:11:29,620
 And then it can show this one, you see.

1232
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:34,620
 So your minus A plus BA then becomes 0.

1233
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:38,620
 So you are summing all the 0, still become 0.

1234
02:11:38,620 --> 02:11:40,620
 This one, okay, satisfied.

1235
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:41,620
 But no, enough.

1236
02:11:41,620 --> 02:11:45,620
 We need to take the E of this second element.

1237
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:48,620
 Now this is 2 by 1 vector.

1238
02:11:48,620 --> 02:11:50,620
 So what do we get?

1239
02:11:50,620 --> 02:11:55,620
 Again, the difference here and here is only have this N here.

1240
02:11:55,620 --> 02:12:00,620
 But N is index, it's deterministic.

1241
02:12:00,620 --> 02:12:03,620
 You just mean 1, 2, 3, and so on.

1242
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:06,620
 So you're, of course, also 0.

1243
02:12:06,620 --> 02:12:10,620
 So you can still bring in this E inside here.

1244
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:12,620
 Just simply multiply N.

1245
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:16,620
 Then again, similar to that, this one, after you apply E,

1246
02:12:16,620 --> 02:12:19,620
 you will become 0, okay.

1247
02:12:19,620 --> 02:12:27,620
 So now you agree the regularity condition is satisfied.

1248
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:31,620
 Okay.

1249
02:12:31,620 --> 02:12:35,620
 Then furthermore, you see.

1250
02:12:35,620 --> 02:12:40,620
 So this example is not too complicated.

1251
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:47,620
 We try to see whether we can directly factorize this vector

1252
02:12:47,620 --> 02:12:50,620
 into, let's go back to here.

1253
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:51,620
 Yeah.

1254
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:57,620
 So to see whether we can factorize this in this form.

1255
02:12:57,620 --> 02:13:04,620
 So let's, let me show this in case it's easier to look at the other side.

1256
02:13:05,620 --> 02:13:08,620
 Okay.

1257
02:13:08,620 --> 02:13:17,620
 So how, this is again one of the very simple tricks that you can manipulate.

1258
02:13:17,620 --> 02:13:23,620
 So as you can see here, we notice the, as a function of A and B, you see.

1259
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:32,620
 There are this result depending on A and B linearly, you see.

1260
02:13:32,620 --> 02:13:34,620
 You know, it's a linear function.

1261
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:40,620
 We don't, linear mean we don't see A squared or B squared or some cross term of A

1262
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:42,620
 multiplied by B, you know.

1263
02:13:42,620 --> 02:13:51,620
 So linear mean is just a simple function of A or B or the linear combination of both.

1264
02:13:51,620 --> 02:14:01,620
 So, so therefore the way to do is you, you'll combine all those terms depending on A

1265
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:08,620
 and B because as I say, we don't see A squared or B squared or A multiplied by B.

1266
02:14:08,620 --> 02:14:12,620
 So whatever, yeah.

1267
02:14:12,620 --> 02:14:21,620
 So, so what you need to do is, for example, the first element and of course you factor out those are constant.

1268
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:25,620
 Is it constant mean it's independent of either A or B?

1269
02:14:25,620 --> 02:14:29,620
 There's one to be, you put that aside.

1270
02:14:29,620 --> 02:14:38,620
 And then what the remaining term will be either depending on A or depending on B or the combination.

1271
02:14:38,620 --> 02:14:44,620
 So you just do it accordingly by pulling out this A and B factor.

1272
02:14:44,620 --> 02:14:49,620
 So I think this is quite routine, can work out by yourself.

1273
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:54,620
 Similarly, for the second element, you will see this.

1274
02:14:54,620 --> 02:15:07,620
 And then here you can make use of the identity because if this is, if you are summing up of A from 0 to A minus 1,

1275
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:12,620
 you can simplify this sum into that.

1276
02:15:12,620 --> 02:15:14,620
 Similarly, this one is a bit more complicated.

1277
02:15:14,620 --> 02:15:20,620
 I think you may not need to memorize this in case this is a paper.

1278
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:23,620
 This will be given to you.

1279
02:15:23,620 --> 02:15:28,620
 You're summing up say 1 power of 2 plus 2 power of 2.

1280
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:30,620
 So you'll get this.

1281
02:15:30,620 --> 02:15:33,620
 Put this one in.

1282
02:15:33,620 --> 02:15:42,620
 But this is not yet quite in the form of what, you know, will require.

1283
02:15:42,620 --> 02:15:50,620
 So you'll try to make it a little bit more compact by looking that as a vector.

1284
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:56,620
 And then you can see this is another vector depending on data, you see here.

1285
02:15:56,620 --> 02:15:59,620
 No A or B here.

1286
02:15:59,620 --> 02:16:02,620
 So it will be H of X.

1287
02:16:02,620 --> 02:16:05,620
 Then the other term here.

1288
02:16:05,620 --> 02:16:13,620
 Now this is independent of all the data.

1289
02:16:13,620 --> 02:16:17,620
 And actually this is also independent of the data.

1290
02:16:17,620 --> 02:16:19,620
 But it doesn't matter.

1291
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:22,620
 We can consider that as a function of theta.

1292
02:16:22,620 --> 02:16:28,620
 The constant is a special case of function of theta.

1293
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:32,619
 And then this, of course, this is the vector.

1294
02:16:32,619 --> 02:16:36,619
 But this is not quite yet in order to take the form.

1295
02:16:36,619 --> 02:16:45,619
 What do we need to do is to put, do a simple manipulation to put it into this form.

1296
02:16:45,620 --> 02:16:47,620
 That's very easy.

1297
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:51,620
 We are assuming first this i theta, this matrix invertible.

1298
02:16:51,620 --> 02:17:04,620
 So if we let G of X equal to i inverse multiplied by H X, then you can get this form.

1299
02:17:04,620 --> 02:17:11,620
 So basically you will be willing to create this i theta.

1300
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:16,620
 You must multiply i theta and the i theta inverse.

1301
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:18,620
 That becomes identity.

1302
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:27,620
 Then you will get the required stent form in this.

1303
02:17:27,620 --> 02:17:34,620
 So therefore we can now be sure i of theta equal to this.

1304
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:39,620
 And then from here you can get the inverse of this matrix.

1305
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:42,620
 Because here the off-diagonal element is not zero.

1306
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:45,620
 So you cannot, you will see here.

1307
02:17:45,620 --> 02:17:49,620
 Where inverse is not simply inverse these two elements.

1308
02:17:49,620 --> 02:17:53,620
 It's more complicated.

1309
02:17:53,620 --> 02:17:58,620
 So therefore we get this i theta inverse.

1310
02:17:58,620 --> 02:18:04,620
 And then the G of X using the formula, you know how to get this.

1311
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:07,620
 So it's a bit more complicated.

1312
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:11,620
 So therefore once we get this, we're done.

1313
02:18:11,620 --> 02:18:16,620
 Our theta H is equal to this G of X.

1314
02:18:16,620 --> 02:18:18,620
 But don't you can build.

1315
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:21,620
 This is two by one vector.

1316
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:23,620
 It's not a matrix.

1317
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:26,620
 Everything is added together into one element.

1318
02:18:26,620 --> 02:18:29,620
 And this is the second one.

1319
02:18:30,620 --> 02:18:37,620
 So therefore in this case this is MbE and also efficient.

1320
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:39,620
 So we are done.

1321
02:18:39,620 --> 02:18:46,620
 And then finally we want to get the CLB is...

1322
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:50,620
 The variance of A hat must be greater or equal to that.

1323
02:18:50,620 --> 02:18:53,620
 Similarly variance of B hat greater than that.

1324
02:18:53,620 --> 02:18:55,620
 How do you get this?

1325
02:18:55,620 --> 02:18:57,620
 You need to...

1326
02:18:57,620 --> 02:19:01,620
 You cannot say simply take the inverse of this element.

1327
02:19:01,620 --> 02:19:02,620
 You will not work.

1328
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:04,620
 You have to inverse the whole matrix.

1329
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:08,620
 And there after that since we already inverse,

1330
02:19:08,620 --> 02:19:14,620
 then this is what the variance we should get here.

1331
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:15,620
 Yeah.

1332
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:16,620
 Okay.

1333
02:19:16,620 --> 02:19:19,620
 So this is...

1334
02:19:19,620 --> 02:19:26,620
 You can see the vector parameter case is a little bit more involved.

1335
02:19:26,620 --> 02:19:30,620
 Is it right?

1336
02:19:30,620 --> 02:19:31,620
 Okay.

1337
02:19:31,620 --> 02:19:34,620
 Any questions at this point?

1338
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:38,620
 So can you follow?

1339
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:39,620
 No.

1340
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:40,620
 Cannot.

1341
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:41,620
 How?

1342
02:19:41,620 --> 02:19:43,620
 Which part is difficult?

1343
02:19:43,620 --> 02:19:48,620
 The matrix one or the probability one?

1344
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:50,620
 Or...

1345
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:55,620
 All the steps looks like quite standard.

1346
02:19:55,620 --> 02:19:56,620
 Is it?

1347
02:19:56,620 --> 02:19:58,620
 It's not much.

1348
02:19:58,620 --> 02:20:01,620
 And then matrix I assume you have...

1349
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:06,620
 You know how to inverse at least 2 by 2 matrix.

1350
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:08,620
 Also...

1351
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:09,620
 Yeah.

1352
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:17,620
 Maybe how many of you already learned like positive definite?

1353
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:22,620
 The matrix is positive definite or positive semi definite?

1354
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:24,620
 Any concept?

1355
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:25,620
 How many?

1356
02:20:25,620 --> 02:20:26,620
 One.

1357
02:20:26,620 --> 02:20:31,620
 At least now I give you all...

1358
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:33,620
 I give you all matrix.

1359
02:20:33,620 --> 02:20:36,620
 Maybe I will do a quick test.

1360
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:53,620
 Just a little bit time.

1361
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:57,620
 So how is this matrix?

1362
02:20:57,620 --> 02:21:04,620
 Positive definite or positive semi definite?

1363
02:21:04,620 --> 02:21:06,620
 Or none of that?

1364
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:07,620
 How about this?

1365
02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:13,620
 Given a 2 by 2 matrix.

1366
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:16,620
 Any conclusion just by guessing?

1367
02:21:16,620 --> 02:21:18,620
 Positive definite.

1368
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:20,620
 Yes, very good.

1369
02:21:20,620 --> 02:21:25,620
 So to be positive definite, you see...

1370
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:31,620
 The definition is you have to make sure this...

1371
02:21:31,620 --> 02:21:39,620
 The quadratic function assume the 2 by 2 1.

1372
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:41,620
 This is the 2 by 2 element.

1373
02:21:41,620 --> 02:21:43,620
 X1, X2.

1374
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:46,620
 So you must...

1375
02:21:46,620 --> 02:21:53,620
 For positive definite, this product must be always the quadratic term.

1376
02:21:53,620 --> 02:22:01,620
 So this is the matrix A11, A12, A21, A22.

1377
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:04,620
 When you multiply, you become a scalar.

1378
02:22:04,620 --> 02:22:08,620
 Because this is row vector multiplied by 2 by 2 matrix,

1379
02:22:08,620 --> 02:22:10,620
 multiplied column vector.

1380
02:22:10,620 --> 02:22:15,620
 Must be greater or greater than 0 is positive definite.

1381
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:23,620
 For all possible values of say X1, X2.

1382
02:22:23,620 --> 02:22:24,620
 Rhoea, of course.

1383
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:30,620
 We are talking about take the Rhoea value.

1384
02:22:30,620 --> 02:22:36,620
 But then the difficulty is how can we be sure

1385
02:22:36,620 --> 02:22:40,620
 by evaluating all the possible X1, X2 values.

1386
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:43,620
 Take from minus infinity to infinity.

1387
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:44,620
 That's not practical.

1388
02:22:44,620 --> 02:22:46,620
 Even you're wrong on computer.

1389
02:22:46,620 --> 02:22:50,620
 You're never in, you know, because your Rhoea value,

1390
02:22:50,620 --> 02:22:54,620
 Rhoea number are not countable.

1391
02:22:54,620 --> 02:22:59,620
 So computer cannot directly solve by exhausting that.

1392
02:22:59,620 --> 02:23:03,620
 So there is a very useful trick to verify.

1393
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:06,620
 Just look at this simple example.

1394
02:23:06,620 --> 02:23:10,620
 What we need to do here, 2 minus 1 minus 1, 2.

1395
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:15,620
 We only need to test the one by one.

1396
02:23:15,620 --> 02:23:19,620
 I mean this is the first diagonal element.

1397
02:23:19,620 --> 02:23:22,620
 2, greater than 0, it's fine.

1398
02:23:22,620 --> 02:23:27,620
 Then the second one is you just take the determinant, you see.

1399
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:31,620
 Determinant of this, of this, this matrix.

1400
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:36,620
 How to get the 2 by 2 matrix, the determinant.

1401
02:23:36,620 --> 02:23:39,620
 I'm sure everyone know how to do that.

1402
02:23:39,620 --> 02:23:45,620
 You know, it's just multiply this, 2 multiplied by 2.

1403
02:23:45,620 --> 02:23:50,620
 And then your minus 1 multiplied by minus 1.

1404
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:57,620
 Because you got to 3 minus 1 minus 1 become 1.

1405
02:23:57,620 --> 02:23:58,620
 Sorry, sorry.

1406
02:23:58,620 --> 02:24:00,620
 4 minus 1 becomes 3.

1407
02:24:00,620 --> 02:24:03,620
 So I'm doing a big jump, jumping to the conclusion.

1408
02:24:03,620 --> 02:24:06,620
 So therefore this is, again, greater than 0.

1409
02:24:06,620 --> 02:24:08,620
 So that's it.

1410
02:24:08,620 --> 02:24:10,620
 This is a finite step.

1411
02:24:10,620 --> 02:24:14,620
 Given a matrix, of course, another condition is

1412
02:24:14,620 --> 02:24:20,620
 when we talk about positive semi-definite or positive definite matrix,

1413
02:24:20,620 --> 02:24:24,620
 must talking about a symmetry matrix.

1414
02:24:24,620 --> 02:24:32,620
 If someone give you this minus 1 minus 3,

1415
02:24:32,620 --> 02:24:37,620
 then you should say we cannot test this.

1416
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:42,620
 This is not a symmetry matrix.

1417
02:24:42,620 --> 02:24:52,620
 Of course, you can convert it here to back to the normal definition by, you see here.

1418
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:56,620
 If you are given this, then to verify,

1419
02:24:56,620 --> 02:25:03,620
 you still can do it here for 2 by 2, 2 by 2 matrix.

1420
02:25:03,620 --> 02:25:04,620
 Okay?

1421
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:11,620
 Because this is, assuming this is constant 2 by 2 matrix.

1422
02:25:11,620 --> 02:25:16,620
 So what you'll do is you'll write this as a quadratic function

1423
02:25:16,620 --> 02:25:20,620
 of 2 variable x1, x2, quadratic.

1424
02:25:20,620 --> 02:25:35,620
 And any quadratic function, you can rearrange that into the standard form about,

1425
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:40,620
 you see, let me see, about again this x1, x2.

1426
02:25:40,620 --> 02:25:48,620
 But now I create a new symmetric matrix for this.

1427
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:51,620
 And then x1, x2.

1428
02:25:51,620 --> 02:25:59,620
 So you have, you can create from no asymmetric matrix using this form

1429
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:03,620
 to convert it into another equivalent symmetric matrix.

1430
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:10,620
 Then after that, you can apply what they just say, you know, this method to verify.

1431
02:26:10,620 --> 02:26:13,620
 Because in the end, we want to verify this quadratic function

1432
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:20,620
 with it's always greater than zero or greater or equal to zero or so on.

1433
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:21,620
 Okay?

1434
02:26:21,620 --> 02:26:27,620
 So I hope maybe you'll go back and, now the internet is very useful.

1435
02:26:27,620 --> 02:26:33,620
 At least in Singapore you can use Google.

1436
02:26:33,620 --> 02:26:39,620
 I went to China a few days ago after, you know,

1437
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:42,620
 after last Wednesday teaching on Thursday.

1438
02:26:42,620 --> 02:26:47,620
 I took a flight to China just back on Monday.

1439
02:26:47,620 --> 02:26:52,620
 And then there I think you can use other searching engines

1440
02:26:52,620 --> 02:26:56,620
 but not that as powerful as Google.

1441
02:26:56,620 --> 02:27:04,620
 So at least here you can do a quick search about how to define linear,

1442
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:11,620
 how to define any algebraic, you know, positive, definite matrix and so on.

1443
02:27:11,620 --> 02:27:12,620
 Okay?

1444
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:20,620
 Yeah, I think before ending, I just am a very quick run on this.

1445
02:27:20,620 --> 02:27:22,620
 But I won't go into detail.

1446
02:27:22,620 --> 02:27:30,620
 It's a bad, it's how you try to figure out how this step by step to do that.

1447
02:27:30,620 --> 02:27:37,620
 So this one contains, you know, very useful derivations and some of the property.

1448
02:27:37,620 --> 02:27:41,620
 So, and also explain why we need regularity.

1449
02:27:41,620 --> 02:27:42,620
 Okay?

1450
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:48,620
 So let's see here we are looking at a scalar case, the easy one.

1451
02:27:48,620 --> 02:27:51,620
 And then the data is, observation data is vector,

1452
02:27:51,620 --> 02:27:55,620
 then PDF or sometimes called likely function.

1453
02:27:55,620 --> 02:27:58,620
 Anyway, it's depending on the data.

1454
02:27:58,620 --> 02:28:01,620
 And we try to estimate based on the data.

1455
02:28:01,620 --> 02:28:05,620
 And then the true value, just a single one.

1456
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:10,620
 And assuming we are dealing with unbiased estimator.

1457
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:20,620
 And then, so step one is, yeah, this also right now probably how we mathematically,

1458
02:28:20,620 --> 02:28:25,620
 we, if you only, how do we define expectation?

1459
02:28:25,620 --> 02:28:31,620
 I assume you all know how to do that because you have PDF.

1460
02:28:31,620 --> 02:28:44,620
 Then what the meaning here is you are, yeah, you will be trying to integrate this using this PDF as a weighting.

1461
02:28:44,620 --> 02:28:54,620
 And then integrate over all the, we are dealing with, you know, real, real, real function.

1462
02:28:54,620 --> 02:28:56,620
 So the data are all real.

1463
02:28:56,620 --> 02:29:03,620
 But then this, this is depending on how many beta samples, integration will be, if two,

1464
02:29:03,620 --> 02:29:08,620
 two value is a double integration, if n, you will be integrate n time.

1465
02:29:08,620 --> 02:29:09,620
 You see?

1466
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:11,620
 Yeah, one after the other.

1467
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:20,620
 So the trick here is, you know, we take derivative with theta with xl, okay, one.

1468
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:27,620
 And then here, how you get is you bring this inside, you get this.

1469
02:29:27,620 --> 02:29:33,620
 And you know this one, the estimate independent of theta.

1470
02:29:33,620 --> 02:29:39,620
 So when you bring this in, you only derivative on this and so on.

1471
02:29:39,620 --> 02:29:44,620
 And this is a very useful trick to verify.

1472
02:29:44,620 --> 02:29:47,620
 This one is equal to change to this.

1473
02:29:47,620 --> 02:29:49,620
 And that's why it's very useful.

1474
02:29:49,620 --> 02:29:51,620
 We take the log, you see?

1475
02:29:51,620 --> 02:29:57,620
 So let's see, yeah, how do we change from here to here?

1476
02:29:57,620 --> 02:30:06,620
 You can verify this always equivalent, of course, assuming this p is greater or equal to zero.

1477
02:30:06,620 --> 02:30:10,620
 Because a negative value, you cannot take log.

1478
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:16,620
 So, but then this agree with our PDF definition.

1479
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:24,620
 Therefore, this one very, there will now this regularity condition is useful because e of

1480
02:30:24,620 --> 02:30:26,620
 this equal to zero.

1481
02:30:26,620 --> 02:30:33,620
 So that means you already get this e equal to that.

1482
02:30:33,620 --> 02:30:44,620
 And then the important one here is you see here, you need to assume your integration

1483
02:30:44,620 --> 02:30:47,620
 and derivative you can exchange.

1484
02:30:47,620 --> 02:30:57,620
 That means your derivative and integrate is the same as your integrate first, then take

1485
02:30:57,620 --> 02:31:02,620
 derivative, okay, assuming this one, you can swap.

1486
02:31:02,620 --> 02:31:05,620
 So therefore, why is useful?

1487
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:13,620
 Because if I swap the operator, then because this one here will be equal to one, you know?

1488
02:31:13,620 --> 02:31:19,620
 You know PDF, you integrate over all the possible value is equal to one.

1489
02:31:19,620 --> 02:31:23,620
 And then one, you take derivative of code become zero.

1490
02:31:23,620 --> 02:31:31,620
 So therefore, this condition means you are able, you can swap these two operators.

1491
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:34,620
 And that's what we need here.

1492
02:31:34,620 --> 02:31:42,620
 So then now using this regularity condition, you can put back into what we did earlier.

1493
02:31:42,620 --> 02:31:46,620
 And then we create this one.

1494
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:52,620
 And then after that, you see here, this is positive, greater equal to zero.

1495
02:31:52,620 --> 02:31:59,620
 I can make this one as a product of the square root of it and then multiply another square

1496
02:31:59,620 --> 02:32:00,620
 root.

1497
02:32:00,620 --> 02:32:08,620
 That just means you have two equal to square root of two multiplied by square root of two.

1498
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:12,620
 So why do we want to do this?

1499
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:19,620
 Because we want to use the very useful shuwa in equality.

1500
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:25,620
 This one, because we are not going to read it like this, just assume this is always true.

1501
02:32:26,620 --> 02:32:31,620
 Then you apply this to what we have here.

1502
02:32:31,620 --> 02:32:38,620
 Then you see, so remember there is a power of two here.

1503
02:32:38,620 --> 02:32:45,620
 So then you just think about this one is here, here.

1504
02:32:45,620 --> 02:32:49,620
 Because once make power of two, stay equal to one.

1505
02:32:49,620 --> 02:32:53,620
 So we have this and then you apply into this.

1506
02:32:53,620 --> 02:32:56,620
 So that means we have two functions here.

1507
02:32:56,620 --> 02:33:03,620
 f of x is this one, where h of x is this one.

1508
02:33:03,620 --> 02:33:08,620
 So you see here, this one you make power of two.

1509
02:33:08,620 --> 02:33:11,620
 Then this factor becomes power of two.

1510
02:33:11,620 --> 02:33:18,620
 And now this square root, the text square root, power of two, becomes, of course, going back to itself.

1511
02:33:18,620 --> 02:33:25,620
 Similarly, for this one, then you have power of two and then you have the v here.

1512
02:33:25,620 --> 02:33:31,620
 And therefore, you see this is the definition of the variance in this one.

1513
02:33:31,620 --> 02:33:37,620
 So what we do is divide this one into that.

1514
02:33:37,620 --> 02:33:40,620
 So we get our CLP.

1515
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:45,620
 That's how this is, you know, divide here.

1516
02:33:45,620 --> 02:33:54,620
 And then furthermore, we want to see because why we do not stop here.

1517
02:33:54,620 --> 02:33:59,620
 Because later you will see, at least from your homework assignment,

1518
02:33:59,620 --> 02:34:06,620
 you will see to get this one is much more involved to raise the power,

1519
02:34:06,620 --> 02:34:11,620
 first derivative raise the power of two and then to integrate.

1520
02:34:11,620 --> 02:34:21,620
 It's much more difficult than you take the second derivative and then take the expectation and take the minus sign.

1521
02:34:21,620 --> 02:34:29,620
 Because typically when you take the second derivative, you can simplify quite some term.

1522
02:34:29,620 --> 02:34:38,620
 It's making it easier rather than you raise the power of two of the first derivative.

1523
02:34:38,620 --> 02:34:42,620
 So that's how, yeah.

1524
02:34:42,620 --> 02:34:48,620
 And then, again, you apply the regular condition and the so-called chain rules,

1525
02:34:48,620 --> 02:34:52,620
 you will get this result.

1526
02:34:52,620 --> 02:34:59,620
 So you get the same except you replace the early one with this.

1527
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:01,620
 This is easier to get.

1528
02:35:01,620 --> 02:35:13,620
 And then here, you see the inequality, you want to make the equality hold become equal.

1529
02:35:13,620 --> 02:35:19,620
 Then the two functions must satisfy this condition, you see.

1530
02:35:19,620 --> 02:35:29,620
 Because our function is with respect to, you know, you see to the variable x.

1531
02:35:29,620 --> 02:35:33,620
 Whatever independent of x is considered as a constant.

1532
02:35:33,620 --> 02:35:41,620
 Therefore, if this satisfy, then you differentiate this further, you will get this.

1533
02:35:41,620 --> 02:35:44,620
 That's a very simple rule.

1534
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:47,620
 Remember, you need to take expectation.

1535
02:35:47,620 --> 02:35:53,620
 And that's why I say after taking expectation, the result become much simpler.

1536
02:35:53,620 --> 02:35:55,620
 You only have this.

1537
02:35:55,620 --> 02:36:02,620
 And then finally, the feature information, it will be just equal to this.

1538
02:36:02,620 --> 02:36:04,620
 And minimum value will be here.

1539
02:36:04,620 --> 02:36:10,620
 So that's how you derive this CLB for the scalar case.

1540
02:36:10,620 --> 02:36:21,620
 And matrix case is similar, but then it's more complicated because you're involving some of the matrix manipulation.

1541
02:36:21,620 --> 02:36:24,620
 So, yeah, you see here.

1542
02:36:24,620 --> 02:36:27,620
 So I will not go through that.

1543
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:36,620
 And I, of course, ideally if you can work out and it will be good, but otherwise this is not required.

1544
02:36:36,620 --> 02:36:39,620
 It will find difficult.

1545
02:36:39,620 --> 02:36:40,620
 Yeah.

1546
02:36:40,620 --> 02:36:41,620
 Okay.

1547
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:43,620
 So I think it's a lot of time to finish here.

1548
02:36:43,620 --> 02:36:49,620
 I know that if you leave a big lake, the queue for taking part is very long.

1549
02:36:49,620 --> 02:36:52,620
 So it's just probably 10 minutes earlier.

1550
02:36:52,620 --> 02:36:56,620
 At least it may be the long queue.

1551
02:36:56,620 --> 02:36:57,620
 Hopefully.

1552
02:36:57,620 --> 02:37:00,620
 Anyway, yeah, all the best.

1553
02:37:00,620 --> 02:37:07,620
 And yeah, so I hope to see you, all of you next week.

1554
02:37:07,620 --> 02:37:11,620
 If you don't drop out, still have a few hours to decide.

1555
02:37:11,620 --> 02:37:12,620
 Okay.

1556
02:37:12,620 --> 02:37:13,620
 Okay.

1557
02:37:13,620 --> 02:37:16,620
 All the best.

1558
02:37:17,620 --> 02:37:19,620
 Any question?

1559
02:37:19,620 --> 02:37:20,620
 Okay.

1560
02:37:20,620 --> 02:37:21,620
 Stay back here.

 Okay.

1603
02:58:46,620 --> 02:58:48,620
 Okay.

1604
02:59:16,620 --> 02:59:18,620
 Okay.

1605
02:59:46,620 --> 02:59:48,620
 Okay.
