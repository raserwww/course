1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 .

2
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Okay. So, yeah, before we start our discussions, here's a piece of information you can share

3
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 So, confirm the date and also, yeah, basically just a date because of time.

4
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 First session for undergrad, so you don't need to worry about, but the two sessions for post-grad

5
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 and the list is not available yet. They are still working on it.

6
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 But you can see, yeah, two sessions. So one starting from 10.35, another from 11.40.

7
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Each session is 45 minutes. It's in the lab. So you will be in one of the lab, you know,

8
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 either ISL, IM workshop, or EFS, or the last one, the PCD.

9
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 So they will tell us the exact date. I mean, later we will see for each of you which location you will be put in, which session.

10
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 So we will get that list later. So as soon as I have it, I definitely will upload to the course website.

11
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Okay. So just book your calendar. That date is fixed now.

12
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Okay. So the date is available next Saturday.

13
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 So not this coming Saturday, but next week.

14
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We are in, yes, we are in week four, week six.

15
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Okay. So it's not next. It's not this week. It's not next week. It's a week after.

16
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Okay. Okay. So that is about the quiz, which is only my part.

17
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And that's why it's from the week one to week five.

18
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 The first, I only have one hour in week five.

19
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Okay. So I'll say lecture one to 13 for the first 13 hours.

20
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Okay. So this is for your information first.

21
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And then we can move on to our discussions.

22
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Okay. So great. This is the last topic I need to cover.

23
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Okay. So what we are doing today is we want to introduce the data mining,

24
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 especially the two important algorithms to us.

25
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Okay. So this is the main focus.

26
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So basically still symbolic face approach.

27
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Okay. So we focus on, before we have deep learning way to do recommendation.

28
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And how do we do the association of mining?

29
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 How to find interesting patterns or significance important patterns or kind of knowledge.

30
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Using this knowledge to make decision or solve problems.

31
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Okay. So this is what we are going to talk about data mining and also the related algorithm.

32
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 As well as in the end, actually the knowledge is represented by a set of the rules.

33
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 So that's why we say, actually, it's a, let's create, represent everything to show the association or correlation to see the patterns or items.

34
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 The items we are interested to see how they related to each other and how can we make sense of it.

35
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Okay. So this rule actually presented in the way of association rule.

36
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 How the A associate with B. The A and B association, each, it can be a set of items.

37
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Okay. So it's called item set.

38
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So item set including, for example, Apple banana associate with cornflakes milk, for example.

39
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Okay. So that is association.

40
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 But can be like Apple banana and also fruits, other fruits like grapes associate with just milk.

41
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 You know, so header and tell doesn't matter.

42
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Doesn't need to be balanced.

43
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And also the items from set to another set.

44
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Okay. How they related.

45
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 That's final delivery.

46
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 So that is association mining, the end results.

47
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Okay. So the key thing here is how to find out what are the patterns are interesting.

48
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Right. What are the patterns which is significant enough.

49
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Why you bother banana, Apple and the grape.

50
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Why not I'm interested in tomato and the salad other things, you know, like celery.

51
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So other things why I'm interested in these three items and related to another few items.

52
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Right. So that is one question.

53
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Another question is how to quickly identify these things and how to measure the importance and significance.

54
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Of these items and how to associate them under what condition this rule is confident enough to say, okay, Apple and banana associate with milk, for example.

55
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Right. How confident, how confident you are.

56
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 So this rule, how strong this rule is.

57
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 So this is things we want to answer.

58
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Okay. So you can see here.

59
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 So first few minutes.

60
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 I tried to cut down the first hour about introduction to data mining.

61
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And then we want to more talk about the actual algorithms.

62
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Okay. So algorithm will spend more time, but we still need to know what's the difference between data information knowledge or even wisdoms.

63
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Okay. So what, what, what is this about.

64
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And then different type of data like the market basket data.

65
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Okay. The association of the transaction data we want to focus on.

66
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And then talk about what are the key functionalities or tasks we are, we are, we try to address for under the data mining.

67
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 And then we talk about the different kind of, I mean, the key tasks.

68
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 So you can see association analysis. This is the focus.

69
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Okay. So we are going to talk more the algorithms to do that.

70
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 That is association rule mining and then associate analysis.

71
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 The others, you can see this very much like other tasks in machine learning.

72
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Right. Like classification, prediction, clustering, regression, and some detection, you know, so summarization.

73
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And then the others, which is under the, you know, machine learning topic.

74
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 And the other two professors were going to cover those.

75
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Okay. So they are going to cover classification, clustering, regression, and so those are the mainly using the deep neural network or using neural network approach.

76
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 But they also touch some symbolic approach.

77
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 For example, using decision tree or using for clustering.

78
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 They also talk about k-means.

79
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 They also talk about HIN.

80
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Oh, I'm not sure.

81
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 A heredical clustering.

82
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Okay. So they also can be the symbolic base.

83
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 So that's why I'm only talk about association rule mining in this part.

84
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Okay.

85
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 So first, some introduction.

86
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Basic terminologies we are talking about.

87
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 So what is data?

88
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Okay. So what is data in your words?

89
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 What is data?

90
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 What is data nowadays?

91
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 So easy to actually digitize everything.

92
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Right. So those facts, figures, numbers, images, or anything possibly can be digitized.

93
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 And also stored in the computer database.

94
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I mean, in the not necessary database.

95
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I mean, just stored.

96
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Okay. It can store somewhere as a file also.

97
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Okay. So those are the things we are talking about.

98
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 We are interested about.

99
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 So collection of data objects or their attributes.

100
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Okay. So even talk about attributes.

101
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Attributes meaning the properties.

102
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Right.

103
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 So this like a particular, the each role is something.

104
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 This could be the, some customer information.

105
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 You know, so you see the ID and indexing and also certain attributes and also certain credits and so on.

106
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Each column is one attribute.

107
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Okay. So this is the, this is the kind of typical well organized structured data.

108
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Then we also have many unstructured or actually like image, like audio, video, those digitized things.

109
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Right. We are interested.

110
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 So we already can store them in computer.

111
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 So that is the data or object we are interested.

112
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Okay. So maybe not process yet.

113
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Just a role data.

114
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 So it's a role fact we collected.

115
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Like the temperature, you know, over the whole month, say for example, August, the whole month, the temperature in Singapore or the temperature in Shanghai or the temperature in London.

116
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 So those actually role data, we just collected every day.

117
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Okay. So this could be the, in the text as well can be actually in the text format.

118
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 So we talk about the descriptions or summary or abstract.

119
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 So things can start.

120
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 So similarly here, just to say, okay, if it's a structure one, we can put into the roles each role of the, all of them.

121
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Data shared the same attributes.

122
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 So they share the same columns.

123
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 So we can actually tabulate it.

124
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Right. So it's like a table.

125
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 So you can have roles to indicate the entrance and then the column indicate the property.

126
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Transaction data.

127
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 That is something probably not everybody see this before.

128
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Okay. So this is actually beginning.

129
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 That's, that's the thing make the data mining very popular.

130
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 That is because we want to do the customer market, you know, market analysis and market related customer relationship management.

131
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 So we actually start to collect the transactions.

132
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 So you can see the ID here indicate each transaction ID.

133
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Okay. And then the items indicate the customer number one.

134
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 What are the things he bought?

135
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Okay. So for example, they bought milk, coke and bread for example, for the first customer.

136
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Second customer bought something.

137
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 So each one is an item.

138
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Okay. We call it each one is an item.

139
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And then you have like you have basket and then you check out trolley.

140
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 So first one, the checkout trolley including three items.

141
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 The second one have other things they bought.

142
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Okay. So those are the transaction data.

143
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 We record it.

144
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And we record it because we want to find out how those items are associated one with another.

145
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And this is important not just to provide the enough support, you know, supplies in the store room, but more importantly, they want to place the things next to each other.

146
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Or they want to have something which is good for promotion, certain products are actually easy assessed by the customers.

147
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 If you think put next to each other, for example, you put the bread next to the milk, you probably initially you just want to buy milk.

148
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 But okay, you look at the bread also, why not buy another pack of that.

149
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 So including that kind of try to understand customer psychology or try to actually enhance their convenience and try to in a way make the sale easier.

150
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Right. So this is the things that's why you have those transaction data.

151
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Okay. Yeah.

152
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Yeah. This kind of data or network or graph and now social media.

153
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Yeah. It's a typically easily can be captured right to see how person relate to each other.

154
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 But this one is talk about also can be, you know, useful for biology or for the talk about genome sequence and so on.

155
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 You can actually generate a graph or subgraph to indicate how the molecules or the parts related to each other.

156
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Okay. Graphical.

157
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 This is talking about, yeah, I update these slides.

158
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 It's just this year and I mean last year, but actually it's very much talk about until end of last year.

159
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 They say what are the important data, the volume, okay, the different volume they generated by all kind of people.

160
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 For example, I pay attention to this one.

161
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Check GBT.

162
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Okay. So this is per every minute.

163
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Okay. They collected.

164
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So this is how many actually prompts they submitted.

165
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Okay. So you can see interesting like e-commerce.

166
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Okay. Look at Amazon.

167
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 The sales.

168
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 This is per minute.

169
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 So this is the sales increase.

170
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 I mean the transaction they have and also this is the treat.

171
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Okay. So this is really the trading.

172
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Okay. So you see the bonds.

173
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Also pay attention to this cyber security related.

174
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Okay. So you see they have this attack.

175
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 They only pay attention to what type of attack.

176
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Sorry. The video attack.

177
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Yes. Video attack.

178
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Okay. So that means actually they try to flood your server with all kind of fake.

179
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 I said, so you are overloaded.

180
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 So you are unable to serve your customer.

181
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 For example, we have a coffee shop and very simple server and didn't do very well cyber, you know, defense and then they flood with this attack.

182
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Then you cannot, your real customer cannot really take order, I mean, make place order at all.

183
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Right.

184
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 So you see this is so important.

185
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Yeah. Do mo is a company.

186
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 They always provide the every year you can check their website.

187
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 They actually report the data, the volume and especially on those very important area.

188
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 We probably pay attention to and they generate this.

189
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 So they actually win this award this year.

190
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Okay. So this is talking about every minute how much new data generated and available.

191
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 So we are flooded by data.

192
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Okay. So we are starving for knowledge.

193
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Okay. So that is not what I said.

194
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Actually is this gentleman.

195
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 This is our future.

196
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Future list.

197
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Okay. So he has this very popular book called Miga trends.

198
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 So talk about future.

199
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Okay. So he's a very, very, you know, he predict many things which is quite create a big impact to everybody.

200
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Okay. So you can see, yeah, this is what he said.

201
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 We are drawing information.

202
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 I actually hear information probably close related to the data.

203
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Also starving for knowledge.

204
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Okay. So this gentleman talk about that.

205
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And our important doctor, Dr. William Damme, actually he's a one.

206
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 He's very much talk about quality control, quality revolution.

207
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 His advisor to, you know, for all the business.

208
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 He talk about everything.

209
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 If you want to improve the business in the end, the best thing is you look at the data.

210
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Okay. So data talks.

211
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 So you need to look into the data and then you try to find out the solution from there.

212
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 You need to conduct the thorough analysis through the data and then come up with a suggestion solution for improvement.

213
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Okay. So that is both gentlemen talk a lot about the importance of having data also even for information.

214
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Okay. So what's the difference between data and information?

215
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Data, we are talking about the role facts, right?

216
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 We collected and then information is to kind of make sense.

217
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Okay. What is this about?

218
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 So like the data, we know, okay, the reading is like a 30, 33.

219
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 You don't know what this 33 means anything to us.

220
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Right. It's just a role data.

221
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Then you need to take it.

222
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Okay. So this is a temperature in Singapore on particular day.

223
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Okay. Then this become a piece of information.

224
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 So this is after process and after you laboring it or you actually associate something, take to it.

225
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Then this data, the role data become information.

226
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Okay. So after you have, so, so, so, so definitely information is very important.

227
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Right. But the data you need to collect from the role data, you have it and then you can do something to organize it, to process and organize it and probably remove the noise and do some analysis on this.

228
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And then you can actually represent it in a way which can call it as information because it can be used for certain purpose.

229
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Okay. So you need to process it and become something.

230
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 So this is what we are saying here.

231
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 The data actually refer to those role facts.

232
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Can be words, can be numbers or can be text or can be image or can be photo, you know.

233
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 So can be stored and processed by computer.

234
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Okay. So those are the things we call it.

235
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 So it's a basic building block.

236
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Right. Basic building block for information or basically building block for knowledge.

237
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Okay. So what about information?

238
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Information, information we talk about, you know, the already processed it and also you know the, the, the relationship among them.

239
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Okay. So I said that you can tag this.

240
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 So it become useful, okay, for certain purpose.

241
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 So like a temperature.

242
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 So then you can actually probably make use of temperature to decide to make something like decide, okay, today I should wear a dress or I should actually wear a winter coat.

243
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Right.

244
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 So that is something can be useful.

245
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And then what about knowledge?

246
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So knowledge information can be converted into knowledge about historical pattern and future trends.

247
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Okay. So that is something we can actually apply.

248
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 So it's a deeper level of the information.

249
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 So have information probably can help us to answer certain questions like what to do with this piece of information.

250
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Okay. So this is another level.

251
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 So for weather, okay, weather.

252
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 So you have the raw data with the temperature, the number and then you have information.

253
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 So actually I can tag with this.

254
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 So this is a, this is a temperature in which country or which city.

255
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Okay. So you can associate them.

256
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 And then the knowledge I probably can apply this temperature to decide.

257
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Okay. So I'm traveling to London and I can actually work on this.

258
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 So I can figure out the, in average, what is the temperature like?

259
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Average temperature in August, for example, they say it's the coolest summer in UK this year.

260
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 So based on that, I probably can predict, you know, in September likely what would be the temperature like?

261
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And then how am I going to pack my travel luggage?

262
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Right. So that is you apply the information and then you have the knowledge and then you need to make a decision.

263
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 I can make the decision for my travel plan.

264
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Okay. So I can advise somebody, you know, they are traveling soon and what to pack, what you probably need to pack.

265
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Not just the autumn clothes probably even consider winter clothes if it's very cold.

266
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 This summer very cold and then you predict the autumn can be very cold as well.

267
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 You know, that is a kind of knowledge.

268
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Yeah. So it's a deeper level and a comprehensive and also insight.

269
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 You have to have experience and then add together with this information and then you can make decision.

270
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Okay. So this is the things we are talking about.

271
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Another level you could be wisdoms.

272
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Okay. So then this is even high level.

273
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Okay. So you need to like our future predict the, what's the name, the gentleman, John, John, John, John, some.

274
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Yeah. Actually he actually can tell, you know, we are going to steal lack of knowledge.

275
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Okay. Because the way we process information probably is not still not enough.

276
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 And then the way we identify interesting pattern probably is not there yet.

277
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Right. So he actually can predict something which is, so this is relied on his knowledge as well as his experience as well as his ability to foresee and to actually comprehend the knowledge and then try to tell us something which is beyond the knowledge itself.

278
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Okay. So that is the wisdom we are talking about.

279
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Yeah. So, okay. So it's not, so wisdom is knowing not to use. Yes.

280
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 So tomato, like a tomato we know is a, it can be a vegetable or can be a fruit.

281
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Right. So you know, you are not going to use tomato in a fruit salad.

282
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Yeah. At that time, you know, tomato is a vegetable.

283
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Okay. So not mixed with, but sometimes people like the color, they can mix as well. It's edible anyway.

284
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Okay. So this is just to say, can have a subtle difference.

285
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Okay. But those wisdom, you are able to decide, you are able to judge.

286
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Okay. So this is a different level of the data or information or knowledge or wisdom you can actually handle.

287
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 So of course, data mining definitely involve collect raw data and then tag them.

288
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 So become information. And then after that, how to make use of information come out with the knowledge.

289
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Okay. So that is the knowledge. Try to extract that is the most important thing.

290
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Right. Because the knowledge will be help us to use, to address what is this about how related, you know, to answer.

291
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Questions and make decisions. So data mining basically is about knowledge discovery.

292
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Okay. So this is the definition. Why is data mining?

293
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Okay. So this is our professor Han Jia.

294
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 We actually, he's the one wrote a very popular textbook for introduction to data mining.

295
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And we know Fiat is the one. It's very important people in data mining and also the AI.

296
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And this is another textbook written by professor Tan.

297
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Okay. So you see they try to define different way.

298
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Okay. So this is a professor Han focus on discovery interesting pattern.

299
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Okay. So from, from large amount of data stored information repository.

300
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 So we are talking about the data.

301
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Data already stored information repository.

302
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 That means already tag them. Okay.

303
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Already have columns and the rules, for example.

304
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 And then you are able to find the interesting pattern out of it.

305
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Okay. So that is the knowledge discovery in a way.

306
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And then, then see a second author actually try to emphasis on is the process is not trivial.

307
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Okay. So it's, we need to make a quite a lot effort in order to identify such kind of pattern.

308
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Okay. So the pattern must be valid.

309
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Okay. So it's not like a full of arrow.

310
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Also kind of new.

311
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Okay. So it's an interesting pattern.

312
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Potentially very useful.

313
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And also they want this to be understood by people.

314
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Okay. Understandable.

315
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 This is something very important.

316
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 That's why in the end they actually put presented in a form of rules.

317
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Right. This is something deep neural network is very hard to achieve.

318
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Right. How to make the things understandable to people.

319
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Okay.

320
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Then also actually also emphasis on automation.

321
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Okay. So this, the whole process discover the pattern need to be automated.

322
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Yeah. Why?

323
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Because data volume increase so much.

324
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Right. Before probably we can manually look at this like a mini supermarket and then they have transaction data.

325
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 We can still manually work out.

326
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Okay. The pattern now talk about large volume.

327
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 So it's not the large volume as we talk about trillions, you know, those data, but you also need to find out the pattern.

328
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 We need to have a automate, automate the whole process.

329
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Right. So this is, so also try to highlight the automation automatically discover useful information from large report tree.

330
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Okay. And to find out more useful pattern.

331
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Yeah. So this is also the thing.

332
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Also he highlight.

333
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 If don't do that, maybe this is something which is remain unknown.

334
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Okay. So it's still there like mining the gold.

335
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Okay. Although the gold is there, but if you don't try hard, don't mine it out.

336
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Don't dig out.

337
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Then it's remain unknown and not useful to others.

338
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Right. So this is the definition.

339
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 So this is, I try to summarize this to say basically knowledge discovery from data is about extracting the interesting.

340
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 So interesting here is non-trivial.

341
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 And so we are not going to pay attention to some trivial outliers or trivial things.

342
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Okay. And implicit.

343
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Right. So it's not explicitly already there.

344
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 So it's not, it's kind of hidden previously unknown and potentially very useful.

345
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 This kind of pattern or knowledge from a huge amount of data.

346
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Okay. So huge data.

347
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 We actually try to dig out these things.

348
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Okay. So take a look.

349
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Which one is data mining?

350
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Which one is not?

351
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Can divide the customer of a company according to their agenda.

352
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Is this a data mining?

353
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 I mean, I try to say already store those data in a database, for example.

354
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Okay. And then let's see which one is we need to try very hard to get it.

355
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Another one is just to directly can retrieve it.

356
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 First one, then divide people by their particular gender.

357
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 So is this a data mining or is a database retrieval database retrieval.

358
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Right. Just database and query.

359
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And you get the answer.

360
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Okay. Second one, sorting a database based on the ID number SQL.

361
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Right. Sorting.

362
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Okay. Counting number. Taking this course.

363
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Counting.

364
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Yeah. Again, you can use a function, right.

365
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Directly call.

366
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Yeah. What about this predict the future stock price using historical record?

367
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Yes. Yeah. So this is probably a prediction.

368
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Right. Prediction. Yeah. Extra frequency of a sound wave.

369
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Like this.

370
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 And this data mining task.

371
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 The data information is stored there.

372
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 And you just do signal processing.

373
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Yeah. So, yeah, we are here.

374
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Most of you are signal processing and machine learning.

375
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Signal processing looks very familiar.

376
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Frequency. Yeah.

377
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Monitoring heart rate to check whether they are abnormal or normal.

378
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Probably have to base on the past history, a period of time and see their heart beat.

379
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Certain pattern you identify and then can classify this patient as the normal or abnormal.

380
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Right. So it's not a direct calculation.

381
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 You need to do observation and then you need to come out with a criteria and then you need to observe over a certain period of time.

382
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 And then check the pattern belongs to which category.

383
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Right. So classification. Yeah.

384
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Okay. So it's not direct signal processing.

385
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Okay. What about searching for information from Internet?

386
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Find the very rare kind of pokemons.

387
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Any of you still play pokemons?

388
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 No.

389
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 Okay. So, so you want to find out where to catch those very rare ones.

390
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 They keep moving on. They keep moving so you cannot predict.

391
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Yeah. You need to be very skillful.

392
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 I mean, a lot of randomness there, but yes, you need to have certain way to catch these things.

393
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 So it's not just an equation. You can write it.

394
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Right. Probably you have to train the system to how to do that.

395
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Yeah. Normal people cannot do it.

396
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Okay. I cannot catch.

397
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Okay. So this is, although say searching for this information, but yeah, so definitely kind of mining.

398
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 What about financial institute try to actually identify those like a very suspicious forduren transactions?

399
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Normal transaction, fordurens transaction.

400
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Yeah. Then fordurens transaction has certain behavior. I need to identify.

401
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 So definitely mining. Right.

402
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Next supermarket chain want to optimize the placement, products placement from basket analysis.

403
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Right. So likely who buy something and they will buy something together.

404
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 Then from there you try to see, okay, milk probably should put quite close to yogurt or should put close to fruit juice.

405
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 So that is all for breakfast, for example. Right. Yeah.

406
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Okay. Next one retail. Try to improve marketing again. Yeah. Similarly marketing strategy.

407
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 So you need to do a very good analysis to customer behavior or customer, what kind of things. Yeah.

408
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Then you can probably have a targeted marketing. Right.

409
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 So whoever buy a computer say particular very powerful server and most likely, I cannot say most likely they will play game.

410
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Okay. Game, game, game, game server.

411
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Then they probably likely they will play the, the, the, the, the, what's that called?

412
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Wukong. Wukong. Okay.

413
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 So they probably play Wukong. Okay. Then, then we should targeting. Okay.

414
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Send this kind of link Wukong where to download or buy, you know, this kind of marketing strategy.

415
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Then probably you can easily got Wukong game. Okay. Yeah.

416
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 So these are the mining. Okay.

417
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 So this is what we are talking about in business intelligence are very useful, very useful data mining.

418
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 So it's an information discovery. And then, yeah, we definitely need to have those raw data and then we need to be processed and then also stored.

419
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Okay. Maybe you need to integrate them, not just in one type of database.

420
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 You probably have all kinds of databases, especially now talk about cloud. Right.

421
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 So we can put everywhere. And then you need to have a way to get the visualized data or have a summary of the data statistics, patterns and reporting structure and so on.

422
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 So those are the exploring the data. Use a statistical way.

423
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 You can also easily see outliers and also some means and values and so on. For example, then from there, we need to have a more sophisticated way to identify interesting patterns.

424
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Okay. So that is the data mining.

425
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 Then after that, we should present the results. Right.

426
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 So visualization that is a final findings and then present. Okay.

427
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 So finding, present the findings and then help our boss or decision makers to make decision. Okay.

428
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 So this is make it. That's why it's very important to make it very easily can be understood by people.

429
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Okay. Then those high rank people, they probably don't know the, you know, the technology jungles.

430
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 So they don't need to know. They can see the rules and then they can make decision, make recommendation.

431
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Okay. So this is a whole purpose.

432
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 And then normally typical view. So you can see from machine learning or statistics.

433
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 So you can see you have a data prep processing part and then we have a mining and then post processing, which is more for visualization come out with the rules.

434
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 Can explain the pattern. Okay.

435
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 So the data mining is a key step in discovery.

436
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 So that's why it's called KDD knowledge discovery.

437
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Knowledge discovery. Sorry. Knowledge database discovery. I think.

438
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 Okay. So this is, we, we involve the pre processing and post processing as well.

439
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 So key tasks. Okay. So one type is actually predictive.

440
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 So you need to have a model, build a model and then you can predict.

441
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Okay. And I predict the label.

442
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 So that means a particular category.

443
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 Okay. So that is classification or predict the value, the function value, executive value.

444
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 So that is a regression or actually you can conduct this kind of prediction for time theory related.

445
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 Or you can predict something like a temperature in the future or a cell price in the future or something like, or even predict the future train.

446
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 Okay. There are not a big category is more descriptive.

447
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 Okay. Describe the things.

448
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 So it's like a clustering.

449
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 So you based on a relationship between the objects and then try to see how close they are.

450
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 And then you describe which category they probably belong to.

451
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Okay. And summarization is a very typical descriptive.

452
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 Right. You describe.

453
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 Okay. So for this book, what is the summary?

454
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 So you describe it. And then association rule. Right.

455
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 The rule, rule is descriptive.

456
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 So described it.

457
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Also can be discovered as a sequence.

458
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 I mean the description can be related to time as well.

459
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 Okay. So those are the key tasks.

460
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 So we are going to more focus on this part.

461
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 Okay. Association rule.

462
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 So here just to help us to see what are the, you know, top method.

463
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 This is a bit out of date, but they stopped updating now.

464
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 I think it's mainly probably the dominant one is which one.

465
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Probably the deep neural network.

466
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 Right. Okay. So, yeah.

467
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 So before it was like a regression.

468
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 You use a lot like a decision tree, you know, but we are, we will still introduce decision tree.

469
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 You still introduce clustering method visualization.

470
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 There are many tools available now.

471
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 They are random forest.

472
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 So this is very much rated decision tree and more like a K and N and text mining.

473
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 And those are the feature pre-processing.

474
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Yeah. So those are the methods, you know, popular methods and five basic one in, in, uh, these few years.

475
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 Yeah. Still, still this, this, this.

476
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 Okay. But those are more conventional one.

477
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 So, but, um, the skills for data science probably, yeah, smash. Still very important.

478
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 Okay. That database.

479
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Probably, probably also important.

480
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Then machine learning methods.

481
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 Those are the methods.

482
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 Okay. So, uh, yes, we are talking about, you can refer to some link to get details for job wise.

483
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 Yeah. So you can see, uh, that was five years ago.

484
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 So we can see the deep, deep learning.

485
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Yeah. It's still the very much increase a lot.

486
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 Right. The demands actually increase a lot.

487
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 And then those are the key tools and the methods we need to learn if you intend to be a data scientist.

488
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 Okay.

489
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 Uh, so for data mining, we still have those key functionalities or to address those tasks.

490
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 Right. So like a generalization, association, classification, clustering, outlier analysis.

491
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Those are the top, uh, important areas to, to look into it.

492
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 And for data wise, yeah, relational data, uh, also the, like transaction data for association, room mining, and then more advanced database.

493
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 We support those kind of data.

494
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 Now I think nowadays most important data problem is social media data, right.

495
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Data from social media.

496
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 So how to model these data likely is using a network or graph and then, uh, transaction data, they probably have different way to handle it now.

497
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 Okay. They, they, they try to, uh, to, to, to see they probably also looking to the graph.

498
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 Okay. Because naturally you can.

499
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,120
 You can, you know, each item, how they relate to each other, and then how these things associate

500
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,760
 with a particular customer.

501
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,440
 And then you see customer behavior, which customer is a friend or which one, and then

502
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,080
 how this friend can make inference, right?

503
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,080
 Yeah.

504
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,040
 Um, application, yeah, application.

505
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:38,800
 So before, like, market analysis and risk analysis, those are the important things,

506
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,120
 but also can be very useful for other data analysis.

507
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,120
 Okay.

508
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:51,960
 So this is, again, talk about the application, the areas, yeah, for data scientists.

509
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,760
 So you can see which year and how they change.

510
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,840
 And yeah, this is just for your information.

511
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:04,840
 So basically, data science is really need people from different backgrounds work together.

512
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
 Okay.

513
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:11,560
 So we are trying to have this, the machine learning and AI, and also make data mining

514
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,560
 this part.

515
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,560
 Okay.

516
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:21,240
 So it's also, you know, help to, to make sense of the data or the role, the information we

517
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
 have.

518
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,240
 Okay.

519
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,560
 So you can also look at from the system architecture.

520
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,560
 Okay.

521
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:32,000
 Most likely you have database and data warehouse or even cloud database nowadays.

522
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,520
 And then you have knowledge base behind and then you have an engine to handle this data.

523
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:44,720
 And then evaluation, visualization, graphical user interface to help the user visualize

524
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:51,400
 the results and then help the decision making makers to, to, to use the system.

525
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,400
 Okay.

526
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
 So it's like this.

527
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,800
 Uh, major issue.

528
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,800
 Okay.

529
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,400
 So, um, the technology, the method itself.

530
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,400
 Okay.

531
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:07,440
 So it's like, how to make the method effective, efficient, and also, you know, especially

532
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,280
 handle the large data and also different data type now.

533
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,280
 Right.

534
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,120
 So how to come up with the best way.

535
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:20,840
 So this is a, you know, very, very diverse data type and how to do this.

536
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:27,400
 And also the, the, the, the information on the internet could be a lot of noise as well.

537
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,400
 Okay.

538
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:35,400
 So, um, this is how to incorporate discovery knowledge with the existing methods, how to

539
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,400
 feel them together.

540
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,720
 Then the user interaction part.

541
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:49,480
 How can actually use the data and with the good user interface with the interaction.

542
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:56,040
 So actually how to embed human knowledge, for example, to make the whole thing more

543
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,720
 feasible interact with them, have a different level of extraction.

544
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,560
 And hopefully, yeah, you have a, uh, one level and you get some information and present to

545
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,600
 the user and then user can actually have the input or select something and then feedback

546
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,640
 and then system can refine.

547
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:20,720
 So yeah, it's become like, uh, more interactive and also hopefully, uh, more interpretable.

548
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,720
 Right.

549
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,720
 Yeah.

550
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:29,120
 So this is, uh, uh, application that was specially talked about how the association

551
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,240
 online can be used.

552
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,240
 Okay.

553
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:39,000
 Then, um, basically based on this introduction, you can actually think about this exercise

554
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,040
 and talk about this is how many years ago, close to 30 years ago.

555
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,040
 Okay.

556
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,160
 At that time, they really, when they see this information like, uh, supermarkets, they actually

557
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,319
 look at these, um, Barbie dolls.

558
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:54,319
 Okay.

559
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,319
 They find actually it was sold very, very quickly.

560
00:46:57,319 --> 00:46:58,319
 Okay.

561
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,319
 So every 20 seconds that is one Barbie sold.

562
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,319
 Okay.

563
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:08,040
 And I had a 60% likelihood of buying one of the three type of candy bar.

564
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,040
 Okay.

565
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,040
 They noticed this.

566
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,520
 Whoever buy the Barbie, they also buy candy.

567
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,520
 Okay.

568
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,040
 So that noticed this.

569
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,040
 And then the supermarkets have this information, but they don't know what to do with it.

570
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,520
 Say, have, I don't have a clue.

571
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,520
 So how can you help?

572
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:33,800
 You know, you can think, okay, with this information and, um, what can you do to increase the market

573
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:40,920
 sale or to increase, you know, things you can suggest anything you feel is, is good

574
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,400
 for, for business.

575
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
 Okay.

576
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400
 So you can think of something.

577
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,160
 So that is making use of the information or knowledge.

578
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,040
 Actually, you try to propose something, which is to address this.

579
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:59,560
 Um, based on the phenomenon, try to actually do something to make the sale even better.

580
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,560
 Right.

581
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,560
 So this is your target.

582
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,560
 Okay.

583
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:09,760
 Then second one is also try to link this with a real world problems to see, uh, what

584
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,760
 is the association?

585
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,760
 What is a regression?

586
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,280
 What is a regression different from the classification?

587
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,280
 What is a clustering?

588
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,360
 And you can use a real world, uh, example to explain that.

589
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,360
 Okay.

590
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,760
 We can discuss about this next week.

591
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,280
 So we don't, don't talk, you can think about this first.

592
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,280
 Okay.

593
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:37,640
 So this is what we try to cover in the first 40 minutes.

594
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:43,799
 So basically we want to use data mining techniques to discovery interesting patterns.

595
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:44,799
 Okay.

596
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,799
 So interesting.

597
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:47,560
 That means it will create impact.

598
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,560
 Okay.

599
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,560
 So it's not something trivial and that is something you want to pay attention to.

600
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,560
 Okay.

601
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,560
 So interesting pattern from very large volume of data.

602
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,560
 Okay.

603
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,120
 So, uh, so it's kind of steps for knowledge discovery.

604
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,120
 Okay.

605
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:08,200
 So it's from the, from the knowledge, from the data to the information from information

606
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,799
 to get this knowledge.

607
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:10,799
 Okay.

608
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:18,839
 And then, um, so mining can be performed most likely in a variety of information repository.

609
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:23,640
 So we are talking about database, we talk about cloud database, we talk about data warehouse,

610
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,560
 you know, so, so on.

611
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,560
 And then functionality.

612
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,000
 So we talk about two category, right?

613
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,720
 So one is descriptive or actually another one is to actually get this, uh, work out

614
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,520
 the exact value or exactly label or exactly future value.

615
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,520
 Yeah.

616
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,000
 Then there are many opportunities and applications and issues and challenges.

617
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 Okay.

618
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,960
 So, uh, still unsolved problem, but still already have this have been applied it to help

619
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:01,400
 many industry and, uh, have some, you know, already have some impact, but still not enough.

620
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,640
 So still waiting for you guys to help.

621
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,640
 Okay.

622
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,040
 So before that, we still need to learn what are the things already exist.

623
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,040
 Right.

624
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,920
 So get yourself familiar with the most popular techniques and then in the future you probably

625
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,480
 can contribute.

626
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:24,360
 So for this, uh, we focus on social reminding and then we look at, okay, how to get this

627
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,280
 interesting pattern.

628
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,280
 Right.

629
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,440
 So interesting pattern reflect in a way like they occur very frequently.

630
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,440
 Okay.

631
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,680
 So you see this pattern several times.

632
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,680
 Okay.

633
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,720
 That is a frequent enough to actually attract our attention.

634
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,720
 So that is a frequent item set generation.

635
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,720
 Okay.

636
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,000
 So there are various ways to generate this item set.

637
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,480
 And then we use the algorithm.

638
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,800
 Remember, we must automate the whole process.

639
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,800
 Right.

640
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,800
 We need to have automation.

641
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,520
 So that's why we need to have an algorithm and then we have computer to do it for us.

642
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,520
 Okay.

643
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,520
 So we introduced two algorithms.

644
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,520
 One is a apollary.

645
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,520
 Another one is a FP growth.

646
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,520
 Okay.

647
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:13,520
 So you can see one, uh, as a working, uh, algorithm, another one is a fasting, a faster approach.

648
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,520
 Okay.

649
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,520
 Make use of the data structure.

650
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:26,040
 Um, so some terms, important terms like, uh, support, confidence, and also the lift.

651
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,040
 Those are the measures.

652
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,040
 Okay.

653
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:35,040
 And then what is this frequent item and what is the two important algorithms we are going

654
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,040
 to introduce.

655
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,040
 So those are the key things.

656
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,040
 Uh, okay.

657
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,240
 Still talk about motivation.

658
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,040
 So basically interesting and useful.

659
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,040
 Okay.

660
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,280
 So this is the pattern we want to pay attention.

661
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:52,000
 It's kind of discover the knowledge and we want to make use of this in the future.

662
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 Okay.

663
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,800
 So question we can ask ourselves like, uh, what pattern, what products have often been

664
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,800
 purchased together?

665
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,800
 Okay.

666
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:05,320
 As I said, like a milk and also the juice, for example, why these two always purchase

667
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,320
 together?

668
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:12,840
 Uh, what are the sub, uh, sub, sub sequence purchase after buying a computer?

669
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,840
 Okay.

670
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,600
 So you also buy a computer, then you also buy buy one game.

671
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,600
 Yeah.

672
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,280
 I know it's not true for you guys.

673
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,280
 Okay.

674
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,280
 But some, yes.

675
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,320
 Um, or actually you buy book club by book.

676
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:34,280
 For example, you buy, uh, whoever buy the data mining book or AI book.

677
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,080
 Likely you also buy Python programming.

678
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,080
 You also buy database.

679
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,080
 You know, you also buy, uh, the related book.

680
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,759
 So in Amazon, they can recommend to you.

681
00:52:45,759 --> 00:52:46,759
 Okay.

682
00:52:46,759 --> 00:52:51,880
 Whatever you purchase AI book, they probably recommend Python programming, uh, database,

683
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:58,360
 uh, also cloud computing, you know, they, they recommend that's, uh, that's a relationship.

684
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,360
 What kind of DNA?

685
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,360
 Yeah.

686
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:05,799
 It can be very sensitive or related to particular drop type and, uh, you know, reactive.

687
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:11,640
 So it's, it's good to have this information and then how to automatically classify the

688
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,759
 documents based on their contents.

689
00:53:13,759 --> 00:53:14,759
 Okay.

690
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:15,759
 How similar is similar.

691
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:19,720
 And then you can automate the review and process.

692
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,720
 Right.

693
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,160
 Uh, also you want to identify someone who is anti-social.

694
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,160
 Okay.

695
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,440
 So you actually want to identify whether particular blog, you know, blogger did online, online

696
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,480
 people behavior and try to identify this.

697
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,480
 Yeah.

698
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:40,359
 So very, a lot of application on no need to talk anymore.

699
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:41,359
 Okay.

700
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,840
 So, uh, try to formulate the problem.

701
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,840
 Okay.

702
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,480
 So association when you mining is about what?

703
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,880
 So it's about, um, finding relationship between items.

704
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,880
 Okay.

705
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,240
 That's a very high level.

706
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,840
 So when I say this, I immediately think, okay, milk and the bread, for example.

707
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,840
 Okay.

708
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,640
 Milk and bread, how they related.

709
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:11,320
 So you need to find frequent pattern association correlation and you know, how they, uh, how

710
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:18,760
 they related to each other from a huge volume of a repository database, for example.

711
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,440
 And then the pattern need to be, you know, we identify these things.

712
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,440
 They occur very frequently.

713
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,600
 If they only occur once or twice, this is not significant enough.

714
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,840
 You probably don't want to find solution for this.

715
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,840
 Right.

716
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:39,720
 And then from there, after you find a frequent pattern, then you want to find out the rules.

717
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,120
 So this rule is called association rule.

718
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,879
 So it's like if I buy X, I'll buy Y as well.

719
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:46,879
 Okay.

720
00:54:46,879 --> 00:54:49,399
 For example, then here X can be a set.

721
00:54:49,399 --> 00:54:50,720
 Y is another set.

722
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,200
 And then inside this set, you have many items.

723
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,200
 Okay.

724
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,200
 Many items.

725
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,200
 Okay.

726
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,759
 So this is a very general way to talk about this problem.

727
00:55:00,759 --> 00:55:03,560
 Then specifically, let's look at this.

728
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:09,560
 Um, so you like to use I to indicate items in a dataset.

729
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,799
 So you have I1, I2, so those ID.

730
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:21,720
 So here like a bread, one item, coke, another item, milk, another item.

731
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,160
 So we have many beer and also diaper, milk.

732
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,160
 Oh, milk already have.

733
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,160
 Yeah.

734
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,160
 Anymore?

735
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,160
 Yeah.

736
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,160
 That's all.

737
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,160
 Okay.

738
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,160
 So this is how many items.

739
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,160
 Then each one is one I there.

740
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,160
 Okay.

741
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,920
 So set is a capital I indicate all those items.

742
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
 We are interested.

743
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,920
 Okay.

744
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,920
 We are interested.

745
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,759
 So suppose this is transaction data.

746
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:52,600
 So, um, but in our supermarket, we probably have others like, uh, just the first five

747
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,200
 customer they haven't bought it.

748
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,200
 Okay.

749
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,279
 So that doesn't mean we, those are the only one.

750
00:55:57,279 --> 00:55:59,720
 So we can have many, many of it.

751
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,839
 So you can have a D of it.

752
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:02,839
 Okay.

753
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:07,720
 And then T here, each T indicates transaction.

754
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,720
 Okay.

755
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:15,720
 So this is a T1, T2, T3, each transaction, each transaction we are talking about.

756
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,720
 Okay.

757
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,360
 So it's a market basket data.

758
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:24,840
 And then the end, the capital N is a total number of transaction.

759
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:30,640
 For example, uh, NTU mini market every day probably have 5,000 transactions.

760
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,359
 And I just, yeah, I think more than that probably.

761
00:56:34,359 --> 00:56:35,359
 Right.

762
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:36,359
 Okay.

763
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:41,960
 Just assume every day just 5,000 transactions and each transaction people bought what?

764
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,960
 Okay.

765
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,960
 Yeah.

766
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,640
 So that is the end.

767
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:54,120
 And then, um, so each TJ here is a subset of the I, right?

768
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,120
 Yeah.

769
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,120
 You see?

770
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,319
 So the transaction only three items.

771
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,319
 So subset of the big I.

772
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:09,440
 So big I, we have one, two, three, four, uh, five, only five.

773
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,440
 Okay.

774
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:17,680
 So can add like, uh, you add, uh, cookie, my banana, apple, you know, you can add in.

775
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,600
 And then this is a subset, each transaction is a subset of it.

776
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:28,360
 And then, um, contains one or number of items chosen from big I.

777
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,360
 Okay.

778
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:35,880
 So a collection of zero or more items is called, it's a termed as a item set.

779
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:36,880
 Okay.

780
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,960
 It's an item set.

781
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,920
 And then, uh, if an item set contain K items, it's called K item set.

782
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,920
 Okay.

783
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,040
 So what is this item set?

784
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,040
 One.

785
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,040
 One item set.

786
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,040
 Okay.

787
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,440
 So three item set, that means you have three.

788
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,640
 You have three of them.

789
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,640
 Yeah.

790
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,640
 Okay.

791
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:00,240
 So, uh, so, so, so you have three items that's called three item set.

792
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,240
 Okay.

793
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,240
 Uh, empty one is now.

794
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,240
 Okay.

795
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,240
 So that's don't contain anything.

796
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:10,400
 So probably the number six customer, yeah, didn't check out, didn't buy anything.

797
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,600
 Then you probably also don't need to include him in the transaction table.

798
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,600
 Okay.

799
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:22,880
 Uh, item set Y is a super set of the X, uh, or equivalent X is a subset of the Y.

800
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,000
 Uh, if all the item X are also items of Y.

801
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 Okay.

802
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 So easily.

803
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
 Do we have a subset here?

804
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
 Uh, not really, huh?

805
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
 Any?

806
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 Uh, uh, yeah, none of it.

807
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
 Right.

808
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,000
 So suppose I have six, I have a, uh, transaction six here, just bought the diaper and milk.

809
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 Then do you see relationship?

810
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
 Diper and milk.

811
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:02,000
 And then this, this one is a super of the six and that one is the subset of that.

812
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
 Okay.

813
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 Yeah.

814
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
 Okay.

815
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,000
 So now we want to introduce you to measurements.

816
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 Okay.

817
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
 One is called support.

818
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
 Another one is called confidence.

819
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 Okay.

820
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:26,000
 Support can always refer to the frequency or the pattern, how significant this pattern

821
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
 come out.

822
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
 Okay.

823
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
 So it's related to the probability, how frequent.

824
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 Okay.

825
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,000
 And then the confidence is more related to the strong or not strong.

826
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 The rule related to the rule.

827
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
 Okay.

828
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
 Rule.

829
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
 Okay.

830
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
 So this is the general definition.

831
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
 The support also can refer to rule.

832
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
 Okay.

833
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
 Support can also refer to rules.

834
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
 We talk about the support of the rule.

835
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
 So it's a, this rule basically is also a pattern.

836
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
 Right.

837
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 So how, how frequent, how, how, how, um, how, um, how do you see the, how, how, how

838
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
 frequent, how, how, how, um, significant.

839
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
 Okay.

840
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
 So let's take a look at the details.

841
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
 The transaction TJ is set to contain a subset.

842
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
 Yeah.

843
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
 Sorry.

844
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
 It's a content item set X. If the X is a subset of the TJ.

845
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
 Okay.

846
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
 So this is what, um, not much new, nothing new.

847
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
 Okay.

848
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
 And then, um, the support.

849
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
 Oh, yes.

850
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
 For support, actually we have two things.

851
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
 Either we use a percentage.

852
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
 I mean, it's a probability to, to refer to a support.

853
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
 Another one is to say support count.

854
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
 Okay.

855
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
 So it's counting.

856
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
 So it's more a number.

857
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,000
 So we refer to how many number of the transactions contain a particular item set.

858
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
 Okay.

859
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
 So come to this, come to this.

860
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 What is, uh, what is, uh, support count of beer?

861
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:21,000
 Number of the transactions contain the item beer.

862
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
 Okay.

863
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
 So how many?

864
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
 One, two, three.

865
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 Okay.

866
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
 Yeah.

867
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
 What about the two item set?

868
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 Okay.

869
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:43,000
 So what is a support count for beer and bread?

870
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
 Beer and bread don't have.

871
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
 Beer and bread have one.

872
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 One transaction have this.

873
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
 Beer and bread don't have.

874
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 Beer and bread have.

875
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
 Right.

876
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
 So total?

877
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
 Two.

878
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 So two out of five.

879
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
 So if you use the probability, that is two out of the total.

880
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
 Right.

881
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
 So two out of five, that gives you the support.

882
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:18,000
 But if I say support count is counting the number of the transactions contain this particular

883
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
 item set.

884
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
 Okay.

885
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
 So that is different.

886
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
 Yeah.

887
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
 Sometimes actually they all mix.

888
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
 They don't even call it support count.

889
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
 They just call support.

890
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
 But they actually give you a number.

891
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
 So you know that is actually the support count.

892
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
 Okay.

893
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
 The, the, the, the, you can tell.

894
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
 Okay.

895
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:47,000
 So this is, so for hours here, okay, I try to use this sigma x to indicate this is a support

896
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
 count, the counting, okay, of the item set x.

897
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
 Yeah.

898
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,000
 So item set x, refer to the number of the transaction which contain this item set x.

899
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
 Okay.

900
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
 So it's a sigma here.

901
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
 Okay.

902
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
 So without say sigma, you can use s to indicate support if you really like.

903
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 Okay.

904
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
 But we, we actually didn't really, cannot, can, can use, but I didn't introduce the symbol.

905
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
 Just don't want to confuse everyone.

906
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
 Okay.

907
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:21,000
 So support actually equal to support count divide by the total number of transactions.

908
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
 Yeah.

909
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
 So this is a definition.

910
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
 This is a definition.

911
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
 Support, okay.

912
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
 Support has count and then not count.

913
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
 Just call support.

914
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
 Okay.

915
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,000
 And association rule is a implication of the, it's actually represent in this form.

916
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
 So it's a really rule.

917
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
 So you have a header part which is x and then derive the y.

918
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
 Okay.

919
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
 So this is tail.

920
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
 This is a head.

921
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
 This is tail.

922
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
 So both actually are referred to the transaction set.

923
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
 Okay.

924
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
 The story, sorry.

925
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
 Item set.

926
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
 Item set.

927
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
 Okay.

928
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
 Item set.

929
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
 Item set.

930
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
 See the x and the y.

931
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
 Both are item set.

932
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
 Okay.

933
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
 And they are, yeah, they join as MC.

934
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
 So for example, diaper and milk and your idea.

935
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
 Okay.

936
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
 Do you think this is the real, I mean, could be real.

937
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
 Whoever they buy diaper and buy milk, they also buy beer.

938
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
 Oh, what's the meaning?

939
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
 Okay.

940
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
 Young mom also drink beer or young dad.

941
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
 They like to grab a beer.

942
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
 Okay.

943
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
 They also help in shopping.

944
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
 So they bought diaper and milk.

945
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
 They also get the beer for themselves.

946
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
 Okay.

947
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
 So that is possible pattern.

948
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:48,000
 So because of this pattern, you probably like to put the beer close to even diaper.

949
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
 You know, that could be the case.

950
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
 Yeah.

951
01:04:52,000 --> 01:05:00,000
 So the strengths of association rule can be measured in terms of their support on confidence.

952
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
 Okay.

953
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,000
 So that means the strength to how confident you are when you say this association.

954
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
 Okay.

955
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 So that's why we say rule can be described by two things.

956
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
 One is a support.

957
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
 Another one is confidence.

958
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
 Okay.

959
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
 Item set can only represent buy support.

960
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
 Right.

961
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
 There is no confidence such thing.

962
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
 Yeah.

963
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
 Okay.

964
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:33,000
 So confidence specify how frequent items in Y appear in transaction that contain X.

965
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
 That means under the condition of X.

966
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
 Right.

967
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
 Conditional probability.

968
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
 Okay.

969
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
 So do a little bit calculation here.

970
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
 So we just put everything so called equations here.

971
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
 You can see support is referred to the item set.

972
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
 Okay.

973
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:00,000
 And it's referred to the support count divided by the transaction number, total transaction

974
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
 number.

975
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
 So it's the probability of the X. Okay.

976
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
 And then support for rule.

977
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
 So these two are for rule.

978
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
 These two are for rule.

979
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,000
 So support, if you want to say support of the whole rule, that means it's a support

980
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:23,000
 count of both items that merge together divided by the total number of the transactions.

981
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
 Right.

982
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
 Or confidence.

983
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
 So it's a confidence of the rule.

984
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
 Basically you can use a support count divide, I mean support count of both sides and then

985
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
 divide by the header part.

986
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
 Okay.

987
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
 Header, header.

988
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
 Okay.

989
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
 This is the header part.

990
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
 This header part.

991
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
 Support of the head.

992
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
 Support count of the header.

993
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
 Okay.

994
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
 Yeah.

995
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
 You can both, you can use a support or support count.

996
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 Right.

997
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
 As long as this is a ratio.

998
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
 Yeah.

999
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
 So that actually indicates a confidence.

1000
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
 Okay.

1001
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:04,000
 So you can see again, I want to highlight here.

1002
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
 These two refer to the rule.

1003
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
 This one only refer to the item set.

1004
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
 Okay.

1005
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
 Okay.

1006
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
 So now practice again.

1007
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
 So the X now is talking about these three things.

1008
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
 Okay.

1009
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
 We want to have beer, milk and a diaper.

1010
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
 So what's the support count for this X?

1011
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
 Bread.

1012
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
 No.

1013
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
 Beer.

1014
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
 No.

1015
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
 This one.

1016
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 Yes.

1017
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
 Have one.

1018
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
 And beer, bread and diaper.

1019
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
 Sorry.

1020
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
 Beer, milk and diaper.

1021
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
 Beer, milk and diaper.

1022
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
 Yes.

1023
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
 Another one.

1024
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
 No.

1025
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 So what is this value?

1026
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
 Two.

1027
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
 Yeah.

1028
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
 So this is a support count.

1029
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
 Okay.

1030
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
 So what if I ask you, what is the support?

1031
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
 Support.

1032
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
 Then you need to divide by five.

1033
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
 Yes.

1034
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
 Okay.

1035
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
 Good.

1036
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
 Yeah.

1037
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
 So similarly, we can do this.

1038
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
 Okay.

1039
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
 Quick one.

1040
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
 Milk, diaper, milk, diaper, milk, diaper, one, milk, diaper, two, milk, diaper, three.

1041
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
 So three.

1042
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
 Yeah.

1043
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
 So these three.

1044
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
 Yes.

1045
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
 Okay.

1046
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:26,000
 So this is a way to calculate support as well as confidence for a rule.

1047
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
 Okay.

1048
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
 For a rule.

1049
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
 So support of the rule.

1050
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
 Basically you need to have these three items.

1051
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
 Right?

1052
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:38,000
 So three items and milk, milk, diaper and beer.

1053
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
 Milk, diaper and beer.

1054
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
 This one.

1055
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
 So it's two.

1056
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
 Right?

1057
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
 So the support count of these three items is two.

1058
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
 And then we want you to calculate the support.

1059
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
 That's why it's divided by the total five.

1060
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
 Right?

1061
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
 So this is a number for this rule.

1062
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
 Okay.

1063
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
 What about confidence?

1064
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,000
 For this rule, is these three items together the support of it and divide by the header

1065
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
 part.

1066
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
 Okay.

1067
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
 Header is part.

1068
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
 Remember, here is a header.

1069
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
 Okay.

1070
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,000
 Don't not calculate the support of the tail.

1071
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
 Okay.

1072
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
 It's header part.

1073
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
 Yeah.

1074
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
 Header.

1075
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
 Header support.

1076
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
 Okay.

1077
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
 So that's why.

1078
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
 Yeah.

1079
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
 So this is the three items.

1080
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
 Now we know milk, diaper and beer.

1081
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
 What am I doing?

1082
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
 Am I correct?

1083
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
 This is three is two.

1084
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
 Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1085
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
 This two.

1086
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
 And this two is three.

1087
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
 Correct, huh?

1088
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
 The header is only this two.

1089
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
 This two is three.

1090
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
 We just calculated.

1091
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
 So that's why you get the confidence value.

1092
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
 Okay.

1093
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
 Everybody know how to calculate?

1094
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
 Okay.

1095
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
 So this is important measure.

1096
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
 Important one more is about lift.

1097
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
 Okay.

1098
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
 We'll talk about lift later.

1099
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,000
 So normally the data mining is you want to find out.

1100
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
 Significant enough, that means you want the support to be above certain threshold.

1101
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:18,000
 So you have a mini support and then whatever pattern item set, they achieve the support

1102
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
 above that threshold that you treat them as a interesting support.

1103
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
 You treat them as a significant enough patterns.

1104
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
 Okay.

1105
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
 And then you try to see how they associate with each other, the rules.

1106
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
 Then you can actually work out.

1107
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
 You also have a mini confidence level and then you believe that it's a confident rule.

1108
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
 Okay.

1109
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,000
 So then you want to do something, make decision based on the strong, confident rules.

1110
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
 Try to derive something.

1111
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
 Okay.

1112
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
 Yeah.

1113
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
 Okay.

1114
01:10:51,000 --> 01:11:01,000
 And association rule mining, so basically it's to find out support should be greater

1115
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
 than a threshold.

1116
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
 Confidence also greater than a threshold.

1117
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:13,000
 So here these two thresholds is one is to indicate the minimum value of the support, minimum

1118
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
 value of the confidence.

1119
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
 Okay.

1120
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
 And then we actually want to find out this pattern.

1121
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
 Okay.

1122
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
 So one way you can actually do the exhaustive way, right?

1123
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
 Like what we did for search.

1124
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
 Yeah.

1125
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,000
 We can actually search for all the possible combination of the item set, right?

1126
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
 Then you check for everyone.

1127
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
 You check for everyone to see whether this one is above threshold or not.

1128
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
 Huh?

1129
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
 This is the one way.

1130
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
 Definitely you can do it.

1131
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:51,000
 If you have enough time and also enough space to store all the possible item set.

1132
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
 Agree?

1133
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:58,000
 But think about nowadays the supermarket probably have millions of items.

1134
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
 Can you imagine you do like this?

1135
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
 Okay.

1136
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
 So probably doesn't work, right?

1137
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
 That's why we need the algorithm which is automate and also efficient.

1138
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
 So that is the purpose.

1139
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
 Okay.

1140
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
 So we say, yes, you can do exhaustive.

1141
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:19,000
 You can use a brute force approach to compute support and confidence for every possible

1142
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
 rules or every possible item set, right?

1143
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
 Yeah.

1144
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
 But this approach is very, very exhaustive, right?

1145
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
 Very, very computational.

1146
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
 Not feasible.

1147
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,000
 Especially if it's related to the rule, not just item set, but for every item set you

1148
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
 need to break down to the rules.

1149
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
 Okay.

1150
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:50,000
 Every item set can be a header and the rest of the remaining item set can be the tail.

1151
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
 Okay.

1152
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
 Do all the possible combination that is generate all the possible rules.

1153
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
 And then for every rule you do the evaluation.

1154
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
 That is really not possible.

1155
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
 Okay.

1156
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
 I don't know how they come up with this figure.

1157
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
 I'm not sure.

1158
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
 I didn't check.

1159
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
 Okay.

1160
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
 You're very interested.

1161
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
 Ask Chess GBT how they work out.

1162
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
 Okay.

1163
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
 So, they are total possible rules for this content.

1164
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
 D items.

1165
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
 Okay.

1166
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
 D items.

1167
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
 So, imagine this D is talking about millions.

1168
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
 Items.

1169
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
 Okay.

1170
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
 Yeah.

1171
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
 So, even when D is six, there's already so many possible rules can be generated.

1172
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
 Okay.

1173
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
 Then you evaluate each of these that is not feasible.

1174
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
 So, how to do this more effectively?

1175
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
 That is the algorithm we are going to learn.

1176
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:46,000
 But before that, we want to highlight what for automation, what would be the procedure.

1177
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
 Okay.

1178
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
 So, basically two tasks.

1179
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
 First task is we try to get all the frequent items first.

1180
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
 Okay.

1181
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
 Those not frequent items throw away.

1182
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
 Don't need to evaluate.

1183
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
 Okay.

1184
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
 So, firstly, do this.

1185
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
 Get all the frequent items first.

1186
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
 Then secondly, only for those frequent items generate the rules.

1187
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
 And then for each rule, then we can possibly decide whether above the threshold or below

1188
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
 the threshold.

1189
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
 Okay.

1190
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
 So, this is things.

1191
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
 Then we can quickly narrow down a lot.

1192
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
 Right.

1193
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
 So, if we have a way to identify the frequent pattern, it's already a very good approach.

1194
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
 Right.

1195
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
 Then after that, actually rule, we also have a certain way to see how to prune away certain

1196
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
 rules.

1197
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
 Okay.

1198
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
 So, that is not the algorithm I'm going to introduce.

1199
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
 So, basically, the algorithm will focus on generate frequent patterns.

1200
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
 Okay.

1201
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
 Frequent item set.

1202
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
 Yeah.

1203
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:46,000
 So, just now we say the rules force way is very not feasible.

1204
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
 Right.

1205
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
 So, we still can take a look.

1206
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
 Okay.

1207
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
 What would be the search tree like?

1208
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
 Okay.

1209
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
 So, this is a search tree looks like a graph.

1210
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
 Graph.

1211
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,000
 So, see, just now we say D equal to six is already have 600 above the different rules.

1212
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,000
 Now, we talk about five items in only in a mini market, only five items, ABCDE.

1213
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
 Okay.

1214
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:14,000
 So, how many possible combination of these five items?

1215
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
 Yeah.

1216
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
 Two to the power of five.

1217
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
 If you don't want to consider empty sets, then you should minus one.

1218
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
 Right.

1219
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
 So, total 31.

1220
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
 31, you see.

1221
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
 So, you don't consider this one.

1222
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,000
 Then, those are the every two combination, every three combination, then four combination,

1223
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
 then five.

1224
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
 Okay.

1225
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
 31 of it.

1226
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
 Two to the power of the D or K minus one.

1227
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
 So, that is a possible items.

1228
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
 Right.

1229
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
 So, those are the possible items.

1230
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
 Just now, another equation three to the power D or something.

1231
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
 That is talking about the rules.

1232
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
 Okay.

1233
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
 We are talking about item set now.

1234
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
 Item set is less.

1235
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
 Right.

1236
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
 It's easier.

1237
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
 It's two to the power of K minus one.

1238
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
 Okay.

1239
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
 So, then, we are talking about finding the frequent patterns.

1240
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
 Right.

1241
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
 So, this is all potentially can be a frequent pattern.

1242
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:22,000
 So, if you want to do evaluation, use of brute force kind of exhaustive search, how many

1243
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
 times do you need to do?

1244
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
 31 times.

1245
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
 Right.

1246
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
 Calculate.

1247
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,000
 For each of these, you need to calculate the support or support count.

1248
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
 Right.

1249
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
 And then, check above or below.

1250
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
 Yeah.

1251
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,000
 So, is there any better way to do it?

1252
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:51,000
 Say, for example, if this one we already know, this one is not a frequent pattern.

1253
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
 Okay.

1254
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
 So, apple and carrots.

1255
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
 Apple and carrots.

1256
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
 Okay.

1257
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
 Apple and carrots is not a frequent pattern.

1258
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:12,000
 Do you think you can prune away some other items containing these two, such as this one?

1259
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:18,000
 So, this one may mean apple, banana, and the carrots.

1260
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
 Apple and carrots are really not a frequent pattern.

1261
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,000
 Do you think this could be a frequent pattern?

1262
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
 Support.

1263
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:35,000
 Think about the definition of support, counting the number of these two, counting this number

1264
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
 of these three.

1265
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
 So, these are really lower than the minimum support.

1266
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
 Do you think this have a chance to be higher?

1267
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
 No.

1268
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
 No way.

1269
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
 Right.

1270
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:52,000
 But if this one is not a frequent pattern, do you need to check this one?

1271
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
 And this one?

1272
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
 And this one?

1273
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
 No.

1274
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
 Can prune away.

1275
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
 Right.

1276
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
 So, is there anything we can do based on this idea?

1277
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
 Find the algorithms to do that.

1278
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
 Okay.

1279
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
 So, that can cut down a lot of time, right?

1280
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:21,000
 So, that is the idea for the apirari actually.

1281
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
 Okay.

1282
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:28,000
 But before we introduce this, I still want to tell you the time, the approach requires

1283
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
 how many comparisons.

1284
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:35,000
 So, suppose this is total number of transactions, and then this is the average number of the

1285
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,000
 items we bought, and then a list of candidates is the M of it.

1286
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:47,000
 So, you can see the approach actually you need to compare M multiplied with M multiplied

1287
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
 with W. That is a big O. Okay.

1288
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
 Because the M actually have the possible combination is 2 to the power k minus 1.

1289
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
 Right.

1290
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:04,000
 So, you can see this is a comparison to scan the database and then check the item and then

1291
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
 to check whether this is above threshold or not.

1292
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
 Right.

1293
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
 So, it's a huge lot.

1294
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
 That's why apirari come into play.

1295
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
 Okay.

1296
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
 So, you want to reduce this complexity.

1297
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
 Right.

1298
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:25,000
 So, this is the purpose is want to reduce number of the candidates.

1299
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
 Okay.

1300
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
 So, you want to reduce this number.

1301
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
 The origin number M is what?

1302
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
 2 to the power k minus 1.

1303
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
 Right.

1304
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
 So, you want to reduce this.

1305
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
 Reduce the number of comparison.

1306
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
 Okay.

1307
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
 So, reduce the number of the item set.

1308
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
 Candidate item set.

1309
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
 That means possible.

1310
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:49,000
 And then also because you remove, you reduce this of course you reduce the comparison.

1311
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
 Okay.

1312
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:59,000
 So, you see the principle is if item set is a frequent then all the subset must also be

1313
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
 frequent.

1314
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
 Just now we say other way around.

1315
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:08,240
 We say if it's a subset is not frequent then the extended is parents also superset cannot

1316
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,240
 be frequent either.

1317
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,240
 Right.

1318
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:19,000
 So, now if this one is not frequent then the subset, then all the subset must also be

1319
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
 frequent.

1320
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
 Otherwise it's not.

1321
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
 Right.

1322
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
 So, this is a working principle.

1323
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
 Okay.

1324
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
 So, we based on this principle can eliminate many candidates.

1325
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
 Candidates.

1326
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
 No need to check.

1327
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,000
 So, without knowing, no need to count their support counting or support evaluation.

1328
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
 So, comparison also a bit reduced greatly.

1329
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
 Okay.

1330
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
 Yeah.

1331
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:53,000
 So, similarly if this term here, this is a frequent item, then all the subset must be

1332
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
 frequent.

1333
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
 Okay.

1334
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
 If the subset is not frequent then it will not generate the superset which is frequent.

1335
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
 So, just this principle.

1336
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
 Okay.

1337
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
 Yeah.

1338
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:09,000
 I think in your version I put there is, I think this should be updated as a treat this

1339
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
 as a three item set.

1340
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
 Okay.

1341
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:17,000
 Three item set in this itself is a frequent pattern and then the subset should be the

1342
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
 one.

1343
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
 Yeah.

1344
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:26,000
 I think that one is forgot to correct the PDF version.

1345
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
 Understand the principle?

1346
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
 Yes.

1347
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
 Okay.

1348
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
 Then similarly, yeah.

1349
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:41,000
 So, we are talking about if the A B is not frequent, yeah, then the super parents.

1350
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
 So, just now I already show you this.

1351
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
 Right.

1352
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
 So, you can directly prune away.

1353
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
 Directly prune away.

1354
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
 So, this is talking about pruning.

1355
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
 So, okay.

1356
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
 Now, ready for the algorithm?

1357
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
 You can come out with your own.

1358
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
 Yeah.

1359
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
 But this is the one.

1360
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
 They propose to address this issue.

1361
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
 So, starting from K equal to 1.

1362
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
 Okay.

1363
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
 Sorry.

1364
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
 Here the K is not about the item.

1365
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
 It's about the item set, the length.

1366
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
 Okay.

1367
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
 Item set length.

1368
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
 So, length increase.

1369
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
 Not the total number of the items in the market.

1370
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
 Okay.

1371
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:29,000
 So, I'm using the same K because I use a K for the number of the items in the supermarket.

1372
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
 Right.

1373
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
 Yeah.

1374
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
 So, this is the K here.

1375
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
 It's a frequent item.

1376
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
 So, length equal to 1.

1377
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
 Okay.

1378
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
 Starting from 1, then 2 items there, 3 items there, 4 items there, like that.

1379
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
 Okay.

1380
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
 Repeat this process.

1381
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,000
 This process.

1382
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
 So, we should generate candidates.

1383
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
 Okay.

1384
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
 Here is just a candidate.

1385
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
 The candidate may be pruned away.

1386
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
 Okay.

1387
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
 We have a way to check.

1388
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:03,000
 But firstly, you need to generate candidates first from, okay.

1389
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:09,000
 Length from 1 and then from the K item set, K item set.

1390
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
 And then you get the candidates of K plus 1 set.

1391
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
 Okay.

1392
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
 Increase by 1.

1393
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
 And then you prune the candidate K plus 1 item set.

1394
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
 If you notice, some of the subset is infrequent.

1395
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
 Okay.

1396
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
 So, K items are not frequent.

1397
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
 So, you can directly prune away, prune away.

1398
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
 Okay.

1399
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,000
 And then, if not pruned, that means those are remaining candidates.

1400
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
 Okay.

1401
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
 Remaining candidates.

1402
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
 Then you should calculate the support or support count.

1403
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
 Okay.

1404
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
 Support or support count of each of these candidate items.

1405
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
 Item set.

1406
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
 Buy, scan the database and calculate.

1407
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
 Okay.

1408
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
 Calculation.

1409
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
 Then you can eliminate those candidates' item set.

1410
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
 They are infrequent.

1411
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:04,000
 That means their support count is lower than the minimum support count.

1412
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
 Or their support is lower than minimum support.

1413
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
 Okay.

1414
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
 Get it?

1415
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
 So, you see, you have two chance to remove.

1416
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:21,000
 First chance is when you generate from the K, get the K plus 1.

1417
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
 So, you get the whole set of candidates.

1418
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
 Right.

1419
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
 Whole set of candidates.

1420
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
 Then from this candidate, you should check quickly.

1421
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:35,000
 Any of these candidate K plus 1 candidates that have a subset, which is not frequent.

1422
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
 Remove.

1423
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
 Remove.

1424
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
 Okay.

1425
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
 Then you can remove K plus 1 item set.

1426
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:46,000
 Then the remaining K plus 1 item set calculate the support.

1427
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
 Okay.

1428
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
 Only those support is greater than the minimum support.

1429
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
 Take them.

1430
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
 Otherwise, throw away again.

1431
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
 Okay.

1432
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,000
 And then, then what?

1433
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
 Then increase the K by 1.

1434
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
 Okay.

1435
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
 Next.

1436
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
 So, it's starting from one individual one item set.

1437
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
 And then after that, become two item set.

1438
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
 Okay.

1439
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:19,000
 For two item set, quickly check if any of the two item set is have a subset, which is

1440
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
 not frequent.

1441
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
 Remove them.

1442
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
 Okay.

1443
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
 Then calculate those item set, so-called strong candidate.

1444
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
 Calculate their support value.

1445
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,000
 And if the support value is still below the minimum, remove.

1446
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:42,000
 Then finally, only those really strong two item set will be picked as a frequent two

1447
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
 item set.

1448
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
 Okay.

1449
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:50,000
 And then generate, self-join to generate three item set.

1450
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
 Repeat.

1451
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
 Okay.

1452
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
 Get it?

1453
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
 That's a working principle.

1454
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
 That's, I mean, that's an algorithm details.

1455
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
 So, you need to run like this here.

1456
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
 Okay.

1457
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:11,000
 So, I may ask you to do exercise on this, or ask you to do this in the final, or in the

1458
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
 quiz, or not, not in the quiz.

1459
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
 Yeah.

1460
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
 You know, you can run this algorithm and then work out.

1461
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
 Okay.

1462
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
 Before you do that, we still look at the principle.

1463
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:28,000
 Also, so the principle is generate candidates by merging a pair of the K, two pair, a pair

1464
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
 of the frequent K items.

1465
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
 Okay.

1466
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
 Only if the first K item are identical, so basically merging.

1467
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:43,000
 Now that you get this K plus one item set generated, and then we actually put away if any of the

1468
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
 subset is not a frequent item.

1469
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
 Okay.

1470
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,000
 And then the remaining one, then you go calculate their support.

1471
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
 And then only take the strong one.

1472
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
 That's working.

1473
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
 So, when you merging, so how to merge?

1474
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
 You merge, say for example, merge these two.

1475
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
 How to merge?

1476
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
 So, you assume the first few is all identical.

1477
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
 Only merge the last.

1478
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
 Okay.

1479
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
 So, this is a tree here.

1480
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
 Indicate those are the tree item set.

1481
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
 Right.

1482
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
 Tree item set.

1483
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,000
 And this tree item set, when they merge, to form a candidate of four items set.

1484
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:26,000
 So, this is a way to merge for P and Q. So, first few are identical.

1485
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
 Only the last one is different.

1486
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
 Then you just, you see, these two are the same.

1487
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
 So, then you will have a ABCD.

1488
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
 Okay.

1489
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
 Only the last one merged together.

1490
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
 So, the C4 here is an ABCD.

1491
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
 Okay.

1492
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
 Yeah.

1493
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
 So, example.

1494
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:51,000
 So, you see these, those are the frequent two items.

1495
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
 So, you self-join with yourself.

1496
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
 So, check.

1497
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
 So, this one, any beer?

1498
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
 No beer.

1499
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
 Okay.

1500
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
 So, this one not merging with anybody.

1501
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
 This one merging with this.

1502
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
 Right.

1503
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
 Because the first two are the same.

1504
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
 The last one is different.

1505
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,000
 So, you can one become tree item set.

1506
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
 Okay.

1507
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
 Any more?

1508
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
 No more.

1509
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
 Right.

1510
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
 So, this self-join with this, you only have one candidate here.

1511
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
 So, one candidate.

1512
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
 You get this one candidate.

1513
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:36,000
 Then, shall we do pruning for this?

1514
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
 So, prune.

1515
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
 This is tree item set.

1516
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
 Right.

1517
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:53,000
 So, if any of the subset of this tree item set is not frequent, this can be pruned.

1518
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:58,000
 Meaning, we should check whether the individual is a frequent pattern.

1519
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
 Yes, definitely.

1520
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:05,000
 Because you see, this already have two items set including beer and milk, for example.

1521
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
 So, individual yes.

1522
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,000
 And the combination, is this a frequent item set?

1523
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
 Bread and diaper.

1524
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
 Bread and diaper.

1525
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
 Yes.

1526
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
 Right.

1527
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
 Is this bread and milk?

1528
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
 Yes.

1529
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
 Diaper and milk?

1530
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
 Yes.

1531
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
 So, no subset is not frequent pattern.

1532
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
 Right.

1533
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
 So, can we prune away?

1534
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
 Yes.

1535
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
 So, survive the pruning.

1536
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
 Then what?

1537
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,000
 Then calculate the support for this whole thing.

1538
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
 Okay.

1539
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
 So, have two type of prune.

1540
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
 Two type of prune.

1541
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
 So, first type prune is the candidate.

1542
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
 Check whether subset is not frequent pattern.

1543
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
 If it is, prune away.

1544
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
 Okay.

1545
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
 Any of the.

1546
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
 So, what I'm saying, any of it.

1547
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
 So, suppose.

1548
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
 Suppose diaper and milk is not frequent item.

1549
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
 Okay.

1550
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
 So, I remove this.

1551
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
 If I'm removing this.

1552
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
 If I'm removing this.

1553
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
 Can this prune away?

1554
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
 Yes.

1555
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
 This will be prune away.

1556
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
 Okay.

1557
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
 Because a subset is diaper and milk.

1558
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
 Diaper and milk is not frequent pattern.

1559
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
 Then these three prune away.

1560
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
 No need to compute the support.

1561
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
 Okay.

1562
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
 But now, because this is not prune away.

1563
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:42,000
 So, this is not prune away.

1564
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:48,000
 So, this cannot be prune away directly.

1565
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
 Then we should calculate the support for this one.

1566
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
 Okay.

1567
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
 I cannot calculate because it's not here.

1568
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
 You can compute.

1569
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
 Okay.

1570
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
 And then see what is the support value and what is the minimum support.

1571
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
 So, if it is still below the minimum support.

1572
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
 Prune away.

1573
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
 Okay.

1574
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
 Remove.

1575
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
 I mean it's not.

1576
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
 It's a candidate.

1577
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
 But it's not the final.

1578
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
 Okay.

1579
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
 So, it's a candidate.

1580
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
 Not the final.

1581
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
 Okay.

1582
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
 That's all.

1583
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
 Yeah.

1584
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
 I think your version here something wrong and some typo right.

1585
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
 I think.

1586
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
 No.

1587
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
 Ah, yeah.

1588
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
 Yeah.

1589
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
 So, it should be diaper and milk.

1590
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
 Thanks.

1591
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
 Okay.

1592
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
 Any question?

1593
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
 Two pruning, different pruning.

1594
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
 Why the chat, the subset?

1595
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
 Another one is the support value enough or not.

1596
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
 Okay.

1597
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
 Yeah.

1598
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
 So, let's do this.

1599
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:46,000
 This is our table.

1600
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:52,000
 And we do one scan to get.

1601
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:58,000
 So, we get C and C indicate candidates.

1602
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
 Okay.

1603
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
 C candidate.

1604
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
 Here the number indicate one item set.

1605
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
 Okay.

1606
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
 One item set.

1607
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
 So, you see we have A, C, D.

1608
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
 Then we have B, E.

1609
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
 So, that's why we have this.

1610
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
 Okay.

1611
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
 You can sort it whatever.

1612
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
 Okay.

1613
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
 Doesn't matter.

1614
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
 The sequence doesn't matter.

1615
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
 Okay.

1616
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
 Then we calculate.

1617
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:25,000
 So, we have one C. One item set listed here.

1618
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
 And then we second scan to get the count.

1619
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
 Okay.

1620
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
 Support count.

1621
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
 So, support count.

1622
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
 So, for A, we have one here.

1623
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
 A for one here.

1624
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
 That's why it's two.

1625
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
 Okay.

1626
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
 And then C is three.

1627
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
 Oh, sorry.

1628
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
 B is three.

1629
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
 One, two, three.

1630
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
 Yeah.

1631
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
 So, that's how we get it.

1632
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:53,000
 So, suppose our mini-minimum support count is two and above.

1633
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
 Okay.

1634
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
 Two and above.

1635
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
 Then what?

1636
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
 Then this one.

1637
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
 Okay.

1638
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
 This one.

1639
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
 Okay.

1640
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
 Okay.

1641
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
 This one will be removed.

1642
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
 All right.

1643
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
 So, this one will be pulled away.

1644
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:16,000
 That's how, from the candidates, we calculate the support here.

1645
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
 Support count.

1646
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:22,000
 And then we pick those, have a mini-minimum support above the threshold.

1647
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
 Okay.

1648
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:33,000
 Then we get L. L here is a final frequent item for this lens.

1649
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
 Okay.

1650
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
 So, lens is one.

1651
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
 We get it?

1652
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
 Then what?

1653
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
 According to the algorithm, we should increase the K by one.

1654
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
 Right?

1655
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
 So, we need to do self-join.

1656
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
 So, here is L one.

1657
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:56,000
 Join with L one.

1658
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
 Okay.

1659
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,000
 So, we get, actually we can say get the candidates.

1660
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
 Candidates.

1661
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:12,000
 So, you see, A, B, then A, C, then A, E, then B, C, and B, E, and C, E. So, we get this.

1662
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
 Okay.

1663
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
 And then, we should scan again.

1664
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
 Sorry.

1665
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
 Actually, we don't scan again.

1666
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:29,500
 Suppose the first thing we need to do is, we probably should have a C2 prime, which

1667
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,000
 is really the candidate.

1668
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:37,000
 And then, we check any of this, any of the subset is not frequent pattern.

1669
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
 Okay.

1670
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
 So, any of the subset is not frequent pattern.

1671
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,000
 We don't have anything which is related to the D, right?

1672
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,000
 So, actually, luckily, all of them are frequent pattern.

1673
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
 So, that's why all of them are candidates.

1674
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
 And then, you can scan the database to calculate their support value.

1675
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
 Okay.

1676
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:03,000
 So, that's how you calculate A, B. So, calculate A, B. Don't have one.

1677
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
 Okay.

1678
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
 That's why one here.

1679
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
 A, C, A, C1, A, C2.

1680
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
 Okay.

1681
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
 So, A, C2.

1682
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
 So, that's how we calculate it.

1683
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:21,000
 And then, prune away the support count less than 2.

1684
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
 Right?

1685
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
 Prune away, prune away.

1686
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,000
 So, we have this 4.

1687
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
 Copy over as a L2.

1688
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
 Okay.

1689
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
 Then, L2 is L2.

1690
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
 We get, can we get this?

1691
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
 We can get like this, huh?

1692
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,000
 B, C, B, E. So, we have a B, C, E. Yes?

1693
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
 When you're self-joined.

1694
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
 Yeah, we should have B, C, E, for example.

1695
01:35:53,000 --> 01:36:00,000
 So, this one, B, C, E. Why this is not here?

1696
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
 Oh, sorry.

1697
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,000
 B, C, E is here.

1698
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:13,000
 A, C, E. Okay.

1699
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:19,000
 If you write C, A, and then C, E, then you can have A, C, E, right?

1700
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
 So, A, C, E, right?

1701
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
 Where's A, C, E?

1702
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
 I try to have a candidate.

1703
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
 Candidates of candidates.

1704
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
 Okay.

1705
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,000
 So, why this one is not here?

1706
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
 Actually, it can't be there.

1707
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
 And then, we should check subsets.

1708
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
 Right?

1709
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:49,000
 So, the subset of this, which one is not a frequent pattern?

1710
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
 A, E. Yeah?

1711
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
 We don't see A, E here.

1712
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
 That's why this was removed.

1713
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
 Okay.

1714
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
 What about A, B, C?

1715
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
 You have a C, A, C, B, right?

1716
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
 A, B, C, right?

1717
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,000
 A, B, C, A, B is not there.

1718
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
 Right?

1719
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
 So, pull it away, pull it away.

1720
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
 You see, this was pulled away.

1721
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
 This was pulled away.

1722
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
 And then, only left with this.

1723
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
 Okay.

1724
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,000
 Then scan to calculate the support.

1725
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
 Okay.

1726
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
 And then what?

1727
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
 Can we continue?

1728
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
 Yeah, we get this.

1729
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:38,000
 Do we have further itself, right?

1730
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
 Yeah.

1731
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
 The line is empty set.

1732
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
 So, stop.

1733
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
 That's all.

1734
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
 Okay.

1735
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
 Get it?

1736
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
 So, that's how you manually run this.

1737
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
 Use the appareil.

1738
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
 You get a frequent pattern.

1739
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:04,000
 So, the frequent pattern is B, C, E, anymore.

1740
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
 So, is this?

1741
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
 And this?

1742
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
 And this?

1743
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
 Right.

1744
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:21,000
 But actually, from here, you can derive some.

1745
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
 Not all of them.

1746
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
 Not this.

1747
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
 Right.

1748
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
 Okay.

1749
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
 So, this is how you calculate this.

1750
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
 And your turn to do it.

1751
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
 Just a quick one.

1752
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
 Okay.

1753
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:40,000
 We'll see.

1754
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
 Ten minutes.

1755
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
 Ten minutes to try.

1756
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
 And the toilet break as well.

1757
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
 And then we come back to discuss about.

1758
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
 We still have to go through the F.P. growth.

1759
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,000
 That one is even more troublesome.

1760
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
 But more efficient.

1761
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
 Okay.

1762
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
 Yeah.

1763
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
 Try, try, try this one.

1764
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
 So, have we said anything?

1765
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,000
 Assume minimum support is 30%.

1766
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,000
 So, you can convert into the support count.

1767
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,000
 How many counts?

1768
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
 Two counts.

1769
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
 Right.

1770
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
 30% multiplied by six.

1771
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
 So, two counts.

1772
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
 Okay.

1773
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
 Okay.

1774
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
 Okay.

1775
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
 Okay.

1776
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
 Okay.

1777
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
 Okay.

1778
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
 Okay.

1779
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
 Okay.

1780
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
 Okay.

1781
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
 Okay.

1782
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
 Okay.

1783
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
 Okay.

1784
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
 Okay.

1785
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
 Okay.

1786
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
 Okay.

1787
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
 Okay.

1788
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
 Okay.

1789
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
 Okay.

1790
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
 Okay.

1791
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
 Okay.

1792
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
 Okay.

1793
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
 Okay.

1794
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
 Okay.

1795
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
 Okay.

1796
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
 Okay.

1797
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
 Okay.

1798
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
 Okay.

1799
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
 Okay.

1800
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,000
 Let's continue our discussion.

1801
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:48,000
 So, for this one, just, just need to be patient and run one by one.

1802
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,000
 Okay.

1803
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,000
 So, we say the minimum support here is 30%.

1804
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
 So, 30% multiplied by six.

1805
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
 So, it's 1.8.

1806
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
 1.8.

1807
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
 That means two.

1808
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
 So, the support count is two.

1809
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:10,000
 So, if we use the apararite, we just need to select the frequent item should be two and above.

1810
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
 Two and above.

1811
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
 Yes.

1812
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
 Okay.

1813
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
 So, just do one by one.

1814
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:20,000
 For example, then we have the list one item set.

1815
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
 So, C1, sorry.

1816
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
 C1.

1817
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
 And then we have N.

1818
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
 We have E.

1819
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
 So, I don't do the sorting.

1820
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
 So, I have W.

1821
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
 And I have O.

1822
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:41,000
 And I have G.

1823
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
 Right?

1824
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:48,000
 And then, robot.

1825
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
 Okay.

1826
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
 Then count.

1827
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:54,000
 So, N, we have one, two, three, four.

1828
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
 So, N is four.

1829
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
 Then E is what?

1830
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
 One, two, three, three.

1831
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
 What about O?

1832
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
 O also three.

1833
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
 Four.

1834
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
 W?

1835
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
 One, two, three.

1836
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
 So, it's all there.

1837
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
 Right?

1838
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
 So, just do it one by one.

1839
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
 And then, seems all okay, right?

1840
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
 G.

1841
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
 Or G is one only.

1842
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
 Right?

1843
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
 So, G is one.

1844
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
 W is one.

1845
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
 Okay.

1846
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
 Please tell me.

1847
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
 Four.

1848
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
 O.

1849
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
 Four.

1850
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
 So, next one.

1851
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:34,000
 So, this C1 becomes this prune away.

1852
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,000
 So, you have L1.

1853
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
 L1.

1854
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
 So, just have N, E, W, O.

1855
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
 Okay?

1856
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,000
 And then you have N1 self-join with N1.

1857
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
 You become C2.

1858
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
 Or C2 have prime.

1859
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:57,000
 That is N, E.

1860
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,000
 And then NW.

1861
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
 Then you have NO.

1862
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:15,000
 And have EW, EO.

1863
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
 WO.

1864
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
 Okay.

1865
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
 And then calculate.

1866
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
 Then check.

1867
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,000
 If any subset is not a frequent pattern, then prune away.

1868
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
 Okay?

1869
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
 So, it looks like it's all.

1870
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:35,000
 I mean, before you calculate, you should check whether any of this is not frequent.

1871
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
 If it is, then you calculate the support.

1872
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
 Okay?

1873
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
 So, all of them become C2.

1874
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
 Right?

1875
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
 And then you calculate the N, E.

1876
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
 We have 1, 2, 2.

1877
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
 Right?

1878
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:55,000
 Then NW, 1, 2, 2 as well.

1879
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
 NO, 3.

1880
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
 Is that?

1881
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,000
 NW.

1882
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
 Ah, NW is 3.

1883
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
 Okay.

1884
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
 NO, 3.

1885
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
 Is that 3?

1886
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
 Okay.

1887
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
 Just do like this.

1888
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
 Okay.

1889
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:19,000
 And then next is confirm the L2.

1890
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
 Then L2 self-join with L2.

1891
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
 Get the C3 candidates.

1892
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,000
 And then see any subset can be removed, prune away first.

1893
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
 If not, confirm all.

1894
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
 And then check, calculate the support.

1895
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
 Okay?

1896
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
 So, this is how you can continue.

1897
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,000
 And this is what we have.

1898
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
 So, this one can be prune away.

1899
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
 And then self-join.

1900
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:55,000
 So, you have NEW and NEO.

1901
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
 And what about NO?

1902
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,000
 Oh, no, no more.

1903
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
 Yeah.

1904
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,000
 So, this is three of them.

1905
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
 And then you work out the count.

1906
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
 So, these two can be prune away.

1907
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
 Okay.

1908
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
 Then this is the two.

1909
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
 Can stop already.

1910
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:30,000
 Then you can list out all the frequent items.

1911
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
 Okay.

1912
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:39,000
 So, we know how to use the appareil to get the frequent items.

1913
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:44,000
 Next is to have a different way to get frequent items.

1914
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
 Okay.

1915
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,000
 Using a different algorithm.

1916
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
 That is FHE growth.

1917
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
 FHE growth.

1918
01:57:54,000 --> 01:58:02,000
 So, you can say that we actually spend quite some time to get the candidates.

1919
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:11,000
 For each, I mean, when we grow, right, when we grow, we have a K item set.

1920
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
 Candidates are there.

1921
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
 And then we need to check with the set set.

1922
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:21,000
 If it's not prune away, we need to scan the database again and again in order to calculate the support.

1923
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
 So, that is quite time consuming.

1924
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
 This is FHE growth.

1925
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
 Try to, you know, speed up.

1926
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:37,000
 And also try to represent the frequent items using so-called this particular database, data structure.

1927
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
 So, it's called FHE tree.

1928
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:46,000
 And then basically we will reduce a lot of time to scan the original transaction table.

1929
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,000
 Okay.

1930
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
 This can be very time consuming as well.

1931
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
 Imagine it's a huge supermarket.

1932
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,000
 Every day have millions of transactions.

1933
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,000
 So, it's very big database to scan.

1934
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,000
 Okay.

1935
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,000
 So, this is try to increase that efficiency.

1936
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,000
 And also the working principle will be very different.

1937
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,000
 Okay.

1938
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
 Different.

1939
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
 So, you don't have these candidates anymore.

1940
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
 You don't have the candidates idea.

1941
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
 So, it will directly generate the frequent items.

1942
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
 Okay.

1943
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
 So, it's a different transaction.

1944
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
 I have several times in common.

1945
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
 So, they may overlap.

1946
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:28,000
 So, basically we need to construct the FHE tree.

1947
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,000
 So, from the name you can tell, this is already a frequent pattern tree.

1948
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,000
 Okay.

1949
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
 So, only frequent pattern you construct.

1950
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
 You grow.

1951
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,000
 You get the tree.

1952
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
 And then you try to grow your tree.

1953
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
 Okay.

1954
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:48,000
 So, this is when you grow the frequent pattern, actually you are, you can do it concurrently.

1955
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
 Okay.

1956
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,000
 For different kind of candidates.

1957
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
 No, sorry.

1958
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
 Not candidate.

1959
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:02,000
 You can generate concurrently produce their conditional pattern base.

1960
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
 Okay.

1961
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:09,000
 And then based on their conditional pattern base, you grow your own conditional pattern

1962
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
 base related FP tree.

1963
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
 That's the idea.

1964
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
 Okay.

1965
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:19,000
 So, you can identify the frequent pattern directly.

1966
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
 So, here are the key steps.

1967
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
 Okay.

1968
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:27,000
 So, firstly you need to construct the tree for the entire data set.

1969
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
 Okay.

1970
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:35,000
 And then try to concurrently construct the conditional pattern base for each item in the header table.

1971
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
 Okay.

1972
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:43,000
 So, you create a header table and then create the frequent pattern tree, the big one.

1973
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:48,000
 And then each of the items you will link to the header table.

1974
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:54,000
 Then for each items in the header table, you create their conditional pattern base concurrently.

1975
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
 Okay.

1976
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
 You don't need to wait.

1977
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
 Not sequentially.

1978
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
 You can divide and conquer in that sense.

1979
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
 Okay.

1980
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:08,000
 So, you can construct your own conditional pattern tree, frequent pattern tree for each, for

1981
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
 each of the conditional pattern base.

1982
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
 Okay.

1983
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:16,000
 So, you recursively do this, grow your frequent pattern.

1984
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
 So, basically the frequent pattern is growth.

1985
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:25,000
 And then that's actually lists out all the possible item sets.

1986
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
 Okay.

1987
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
 So, this is the idea.

1988
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:33,000
 We have to go through this example to show you, okay, the key steps.

1989
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:37,000
 So, you see we still have these five transactions recorded.

1990
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:40,000
 And then each one, they bought things.

1991
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
 Okay.

1992
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:47,000
 So, the first time is, so total for this one, total now you only need to scan the whole

1993
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
 transaction table two times.

1994
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
 Two times only.

1995
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
 Okay.

1996
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
 Now only need two times.

1997
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
 Why?

1998
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:04,000
 First time you get all the, you basically build this kind of like a header table.

1999
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
 Okay.

2000
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
 Like header table.

2001
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
 But some actually can be removed.

2002
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:16,000
 So, you have the F, you have the A, you have the C, you have D, G, I, M, P. Okay.

2003
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
 So, each, each, each you listed, each listed here.

2004
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
 And then you work out.

2005
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:29,000
 Second time, second time you can compute a scan, a scan this database and then you calculate

2006
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,000
 the support.

2007
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,000
 Okay.

2008
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
 Calculate for support for each one item.

2009
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
 One item set.

2010
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
 For F, you get the value of four.

2011
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,000
 You see one F here, one, three, four.

2012
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,000
 Right?

2013
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
 So, four.

2014
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
 You put the four here.

2015
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:51,000
 And then A, you have one, two, three.

2016
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
 So, A, four.

2017
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,000
 One, two, three only.

2018
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
 Oh.

2019
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
 Oh yes, yes, three.

2020
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
 Okay, three.

2021
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:05,000
 And then C, yeah, you get four and so on.

2022
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:09,000
 Okay, but D, what about D?

2023
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,000
 D, you can tentatively put here.

2024
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:18,000
 D, you get one, one only.

2025
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
 Right?

2026
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
 Yeah, so suppose our minimum support is three.

2027
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
 Okay.

2028
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
 Our minimum support is three.

2029
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
 Yeah.

2030
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
 So, this one is not frequent pattern.

2031
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
 So, it should be removed.

2032
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:40,000
 Okay, so same thing for G, same thing for I, and same thing for L, O, you know, that's

2033
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,000
 below the minimum support so you can cancel away.

2034
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:52,000
 Then we need to reorganize your frequent items, frequent one item set now.

2035
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,000
 Okay.

2036
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:58,000
 So, that means you based on this header table.

2037
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:03,000
 The header table only records those frequent one items.

2038
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:08,000
 Okay, so not including the D and not including G, those are already removed.

2039
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
 So, it's not in the header table.

2040
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:14,000
 Header table only keep those items which are frequent.

2041
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,000
 Okay, so that's why we have this.

2042
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:23,000
 These two F and C have the same frequency so you, up to you, you can put the C first

2043
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
 or you put the F first.

2044
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,000
 Okay, so that's the sequence we have.

2045
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:36,000
 And then we should sort these items you bought in the transaction table accordingly.

2046
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:40,000
 Okay, you ordered the only frequent items.

2047
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:44,000
 You already throw away those infrequent one.

2048
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:52,000
 Okay, so that is you have F and then C in front of A, you order them because C have four,

2049
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
 A have three.

2050
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,000
 So, and throw away DGI already.

2051
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,000
 So, that's how you get this and how you get this.

2052
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
 So, you see the three columns?

2053
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,000
 Three columns.

2054
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:07,000
 So, the first one is ID, second one is item you actually bought.

2055
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,000
 The third one is only frequent one.

2056
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,000
 Okay, only frequent items.

2057
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:17,000
 And also ordered based on your header table the frequency.

2058
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:21,000
 Okay, you call it support count.

2059
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,000
 Okay, so that's how you ordered it.

2060
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,000
 Done?

2061
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:31,000
 Okay, so after that, then we should construct this.

2062
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,000
 What is this?

2063
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
 This is called frequent pattern tree.

2064
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:40,000
 Okay, that is only frequent pattern we are paying attention.

2065
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
 We throw away not frequent one already.

2066
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
 Only pay attention to frequent patterns.

2067
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:51,000
 So, when we construct, we basically need to go through this table second time.

2068
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:56,000
 Okay, so what we do is we go through this column.

2069
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:06,000
 So, we go through F, C, A, so this is the F, then C, then A, then M, then P.

2070
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
 Okay, I'll show you later.

2071
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
 But this is the final one.

2072
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:17,000
 This is actually the final FP tree.

2073
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,000
 I'll show you how to construct it later.

2074
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:23,000
 But suppose just accept this is the tree.

2075
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:29,000
 So, this is we scan the database once, find the one item, frequent one items.

2076
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:34,000
 Okay, then we sort based on their support count.

2077
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
 And you get the F list.

2078
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
 So, this is called F list.

2079
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
 Okay, so ordered.

2080
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,000
 Now we scan this to construct the tree.

2081
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,000
 To construct.

2082
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
 So, this is a final tree.

2083
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
 Okay, final tree.

2084
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
 So, how to construct the tree?

2085
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
 Basically scan this one by one.

2086
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:58,000
 Okay, so this is how you construct.

2087
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:06,000
 So, just now the first, first, okay, we just do it here.

2088
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
 Okay, so F, C, A, M, P, right?

2089
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:14,000
 So, the number here, suppose in the beginning is one.

2090
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
 Right, so this is only one.

2091
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
 So, here also one.

2092
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,000
 And then here also one.

2093
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
 And then here also one.

2094
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
 Here also one.

2095
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:34,000
 That is what we have when we first branch were created after done this.

2096
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
 Okay.

2097
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,000
 Then do the second one.

2098
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
 So, F increased by one.

2099
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
 So, now become two.

2100
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
 Update, okay?

2101
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,000
 And then C become two.

2102
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:52,000
 And then A, two.

2103
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,000
 And then B.

2104
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:56,000
 So, B cannot go this way, right?

2105
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
 So, have to have a new branch.

2106
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
 So, B, one.

2107
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
 And then M, one.

2108
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
 That's how you do this.

2109
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,000
 Okay, so that, down with this.

2110
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
 Then third one.

2111
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
 F and B.

2112
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
 F increased by one.

2113
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
 Become three.

2114
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,000
 Then B, now cannot go here already.

2115
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,000
 So, B.

2116
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
 Okay, B first time.

2117
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,000
 So, B, one.

2118
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:25,000
 So, we have done this.

2119
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,000
 Number four, C, so it's not F.

2120
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
 So, have to new branch.

2121
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,000
 C, one.

2122
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
 B, one.

2123
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,000
 P, one.

2124
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
 Okay, so how we get this?

2125
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
 And then, last one.

2126
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
 F, C, A.

2127
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,000
 So, F, now become four.

2128
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
 Okay?

2129
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:51,000
 So, I erase.

2130
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
 So, and then C.

2131
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:56,000
 So, C was two, now become three.

2132
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,000
 Okay, A was three.

2133
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
 Uh, A was two, sorry.

2134
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:08,000
 A was, A was two, yes.

2135
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
 A was two.

2136
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
 Okay, now A three.

2137
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:15,000
 Okay, and then M, M increased by one.

2138
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
 So, M was one, now become two.

2139
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,000
 And then P, P increased by one.

2140
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
 So, what's one, now become two.

2141
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
 Okay, we are done.

2142
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,000
 That's how we construct the FP tree.

2143
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:41,000
 Okay, so we are finishing the construction.

2144
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:53,000
 And one more thing is to link the header table, okay, to each of these nodes in the FP tree.

2145
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:56,000
 So, F, yeah, the only node is here.

2146
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
 So, we point into here.

2147
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:01,000
 The C, point into the first one.

2148
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
 And then this C actually also have another C.

2149
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
 So, we also link them up.

2150
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
 Okay?

2151
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,000
 And then, uh, A.

2152
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
 So, A also the only A we have here.

2153
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,000
 And then B, B have one B here, have another B here.

2154
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
 So, oh, sorry, another B here.

2155
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
 And then also link to this.

2156
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
 Okay, so those are the B related.

2157
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
 And then, uh, lastly, the P.

2158
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,000
 Okay?

2159
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:30,000
 So, this is how you actually, yeah, M also have the M related.

2160
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
 That's all.

2161
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:36,000
 That's how we construct the FP tree.

2162
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
 Okay.

2163
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,000
 So, you can see FP tree only hold what?

2164
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
 Only hold frequent patterns.

2165
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,000
 Okay, only hold frequent patterns.

2166
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:53,000
 So, so this is how we have this.

2167
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
 Okay.

2168
02:10:54,000 --> 02:11:06,000
 And then, next one is concurrently take the nodes in the header table to construct your own conditional pattern base.

2169
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
 Okay?

2170
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,000
 Conditional pattern base.

2171
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:13,000
 So, for example, so that means each, so that means you have a contract.

2172
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:20,000
 You can contract the conditional pattern base for F, for C, for A, for B, and for each of these.

2173
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,000
 Okay?

2174
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,000
 So, concurrently, you don't need to wait because each of this is independent.

2175
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
 So, for example, here to see the M.

2176
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,000
 So, M related to this, right?

2177
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:36,000
 And also this, this is only two M in this FP tree.

2178
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
 So, when we have this one, we track back.

2179
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
 So, this is two.

2180
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:45,000
 So, that means A can be two, C can be two, F can be two.

2181
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,000
 Okay?

2182
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
 So, that is this.

2183
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:54,000
 The conditional pattern base for M is this tree.

2184
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,000
 The value is two.

2185
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
 So, this is the one.

2186
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
 Okay?

2187
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
 And second one for M is here.

2188
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
 So, track back.

2189
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,000
 This is a branch.

2190
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
 Okay?

2191
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:09,000
 So, you have F, C, A, and B.

2192
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,000
 And the value is one.

2193
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
 Okay?

2194
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:18,000
 So, you get the M conditional pattern base.

2195
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
 And then, then what?

2196
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:25,000
 You treat this as a frequent pattern base like what you did before.

2197
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,000
 Okay?

2198
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:35,000
 Then you try to construct the frequent pattern tree for this conditional pattern base.

2199
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,000
 Okay?

2200
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
 So, this is the first one.

2201
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:42,000
 That's why we have F, C, A, and it's two.

2202
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:49,000
 So, it should be two.

2203
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,000
 Okay?

2204
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:59,000
 So, it should be two, two, two.

2205
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,000
 Right?

2206
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
 Based on this.

2207
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
 I'm done with this.

2208
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
 And then, second one.

2209
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,000
 F, C, A, B.

2210
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:13,000
 So, F, C, A are increased by one.

2211
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:19,000
 So, that's why it's three.

2212
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:26,000
 So, become three, three, and three.

2213
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:30,000
 Then what about the B?

2214
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,000
 Oh, sorry.

2215
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:38,000
 Actually, do we need to have the B?

2216
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,000
 Okay.

2217
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:49,000
 Based on this pattern base, we should have the, we should work out the frequent pattern.

2218
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,000
 Okay?

2219
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:57,000
 So, that is F. F become two plus one.

2220
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
 So, three.

2221
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:03,000
 And C become two plus one.

2222
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:04,000
 Three.

2223
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:07,000
 A become three.

2224
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:10,000
 Three, three, and three.

2225
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,000
 One.

2226
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:15,000
 So, this is not there.

2227
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,000
 Okay?

2228
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:20,000
 So, that's why you construct this.

2229
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:23,000
 So, that is the M conditional FP3.

2230
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:24,000
 Frequent pattern.

2231
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:30,000
 B is not frequent pattern in this conditional pattern base.

2232
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
 Okay?

2233
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:38,000
 So, after you have this, a single branch already, you basically can list out all the combinations.

2234
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:44,000
 That means you have, you can have F with M, which is a frequent pattern.

2235
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:50,000
 And then, you can have F with M, which is a frequent pattern.

2236
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:55,000
 And then, you can have F with M, which is a frequent pattern.

2237
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:01,000
 That means you have, you can have F with M, which is a frequent pattern.

2238
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:12,000
 And then, C with M, and A with M, and then, FC with M, FC, F, A with M, CA with M, you

2239
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
 know, all the possible combinations.

2240
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:21,000
 And then, also, FC, AM, those are all possible frequent patterns.

2241
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,000
 You automatically generate it.

2242
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
 That's all.

2243
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
 How nice.

2244
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:34,000
 Concurrently, you can do this conditional pattern base.

2245
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:39,000
 Then, construct your conditional pattern FP3.

2246
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:42,000
 And then, recursively do this.

2247
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:50,000
 So, if your tree is not a single branch yet, do very much like, so you still have a header table for your

2248
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:54,000
 conditional pattern base, and do this again.

2249
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
 Okay?

2250
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,000
 Recursively.

2251
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:05,000
 Until you get a single branch, then you just do the all the possible elimination, and then,

2252
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
 you will eliminate, okay?

2253
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,000
 Then, you list out all the possible, possible combinations.

2254
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:14,000
 That's all.

2255
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,000
 Okay.

2256
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:24,000
 So, that is the details about just now, yeah, how this is constructed.

2257
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,000
 Like, AB, that's why you have AB.

2258
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:32,000
 Then, this is when you read the second transaction ID.

2259
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:36,000
 So, you have the BCD, that's why you have a BCD.

2260
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:39,000
 And then, B and B can connect together.

2261
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
 Okay?

2262
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:45,000
 So, that's the details about constructing the FP3.

2263
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
 We did it together already, right?

2264
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:56,000
 And this is the final layer, the constructed FP3 here, based on this transaction.

2265
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
 And then, create the table.

2266
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
 Okay?

2267
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:04,000
 We also did it together earlier.

2268
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:09,000
 The pointer in the header table, just pointing to one of it.

2269
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
 Okay?

2270
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,000
 And then, the related one, they should connect themselves.

2271
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
 Okay?

2272
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
 Connect together.

2273
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:20,000
 Because this will be useful to construct your conditional pattern base.

2274
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,000
 Okay?

2275
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
 Get it?

2276
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:31,000
 So, scan once to get all the one single frequent items, and then, sort it to get the F list.

2277
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:36,000
 Then, from the F list, you construct, scan again to construct the FP3.

2278
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:41,000
 And for each, after you finish construct the FP3, you get the header table.

2279
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:50,000
 And then, from each of the items in elements in header table, you construct the conditional pattern base.

2280
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
 Okay?

2281
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:56,000
 Then, grow like that.

2282
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:02,000
 And also, yeah.

2283
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:06,000
 This is the one to show us how to construct conditional pattern base.

2284
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
 Okay?

2285
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,000
 So, just now, we say one more example to use a D, for example.

2286
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:17,000
 Use a D as a, we try to construct the conditional pattern base for D.

2287
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:18,000
 Okay?

2288
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,000
 So, D is one here.

2289
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,000
 That's why you have a A, B, C one.

2290
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
 Actually, for each of these is one.

2291
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,000
 Okay?

2292
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:26,000
 So, this is one.

2293
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:32,000
 And then, for second D is A and B. So, it's A and B here, the first one, the first branch,

2294
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,000
 second branch.

2295
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
 And then, this D is AC.

2296
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:41,000
 So, it's A and C. And then, this one is A only.

2297
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:47,000
 And then, this D, which is a B and C. Okay?

2298
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:52,000
 That is a pattern base, a conditional pattern base, conditional pattern base.

2299
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:57,000
 And then, we should apply the NP growth on this conditional pattern base.

2300
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:02,000
 That means we should actually get the F list.

2301
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,000
 Right?

2302
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,000
 Get their F list.

2303
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
 Because the A now is four.

2304
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
 One, two, three, four.

2305
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
 And B, three, C, three.

2306
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
 Okay?

2307
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
 So, all of them are available.

2308
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,000
 Right?

2309
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:20,000
 So, your list will be A, B, C. And then, A, B, and AC.

2310
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:27,000
 So, there you can construct the tree.

2311
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
 Okay?

2312
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:35,000
 So, this is your FP3 for this conditional pattern base of the D. Okay?

2313
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
 So, yes, ABC.

2314
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,000
 Okay?

2315
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
 It's one.

2316
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,000
 And then, AB.

2317
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,000
 So, A increased by B increased by one.

2318
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
 Okay?

2319
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,000
 Then, AC.

2320
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:46,000
 A increased.

2321
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
 So, A becomes three now.

2322
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
 C is the new one.

2323
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,000
 C is the first time.

2324
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,000
 So, B was two.

2325
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
 Yeah?

2326
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
 Then, AC done A. Yeah?

2327
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
 A becomes four.

2328
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
 Then, BC.

2329
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
 So, BC.

2330
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,000
 So, that's how you get it.

2331
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,000
 And then, you should have a header table for this tree.

2332
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,000
 Okay?

2333
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:07,000
 The header table here should have a C. Should have a A.

2334
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:10,000
 Uh, uh, uh, let's wait.

2335
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,000
 ABC.

2336
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
 Yes, yes.

2337
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
 So, you should have ABC.

2338
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
 You should have ABC.

2339
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:26,000
 Then, you can have, uh, concurrently do that for, just now, this is a D. The conditional

2340
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:36,000
 pattern base for D. So, you can with C and then, you track back to construct recursively.

2341
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
 Okay?

2342
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:42,000
 So, this is a D under the condition of that construct base.

2343
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,000
 Okay?

2344
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
 So, this is finally, you can get this.

2345
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:50,000
 You can go back and check how to construct further from here.

2346
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,000
 So, you have a header table.

2347
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
 And then, this is ABC.

2348
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:07,000
 So, the C and B. And then, you have A. And then, A link to.

2349
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
 So, A should connect to here.

2350
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:13,000
 And then, B connect to here.

2351
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:14,000
 And C connect to here.

2352
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,000
 And then, you should construct that accordingly.

2353
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
 So, that means under the condition.

2354
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:28,000
 So, you will create a conditional pattern base, conditional pattern base, based on the D and

2355
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,000
 the C. Okay?

2356
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:34,000
 Because, because this is C, which is from the D. Okay?

2357
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,000
 So, that is how you do it.

2358
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
 Grow like this.

2359
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,000
 And you can also have a counting greater than two.

2360
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:46,000
 You can actually eventually, you get this.

2361
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,000
 Okay?

2362
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:53,000
 And this is actually based on the principle of what?

2363
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:56,000
 Fp grows actually based on this principle.

2364
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,000
 Okay?

2365
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:07,000
 To say, if the alpha is a frequent pattern in the original transaction database.

2366
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:15,000
 And then, the conditional pattern base for alpha, if you call it as a B. Okay?

2367
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:25,000
 So, if you call this as a B. And then, one of the items called beta in the B. Okay?

2368
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:33,000
 Beta in the B. So, if you want to check whether alpha together with beta is a frequent pattern

2369
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:40,000
 in the original database, you need to make sure this beta definitely is a frequent pattern

2370
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:48,000
 in the conditional pattern base of the B. So, you see, that's why you can divide on

2371
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,000
 CONQUER.

2372
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
 You divide into their own.

2373
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,000
 And then, each of these own construct their conditional pattern base.

2374
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:00,000
 And then, make sure identify all the frequent patterns in that conditional database.

2375
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:08,000
 Then, possibly, it can merge with your conditional pattern alpha to be a frequent pattern.

2376
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,000
 That is the working principle.

2377
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
 Okay?

2378
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
 Okay?

2379
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,000
 Yeah, example.

2380
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:18,000
 So, if now alpha is a M, just now we have M, remember?

2381
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:24,000
 The M. And then, the conditional pattern base is like this, for example.

2382
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:28,000
 You have FCA, which is three, and B is one, and so on.

2383
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:32,000
 So, that is their conditional pattern base, for example.

2384
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:36,000
 And then, one of the things which is beta, right?

2385
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
 This beta actually only have one.

2386
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:42,000
 So, that is not a frequent pattern at all.

2387
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:47,000
 So, it's no way you will have M and B. Okay?

2388
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
 Or B and M.

2389
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
 So, how about this one?

2390
02:23:51,000 --> 02:24:02,000
 Is there a chance you have FCA and M?

2391
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,000
 Yes or no?

2392
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:10,000
 Is this a frequent pattern in this conditional pattern base?

2393
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,000
 Yes.

2394
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
 So, yes.

2395
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:14,000
 Okay?

2396
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:17,000
 So, you can have FCA M.

2397
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:22,000
 Now, can you have FCB M?

2398
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
 No, right?

2399
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:26,000
 Because B is not a frequent pattern.

2400
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:31,000
 So, the combination of course not.

2401
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
 Remember?

2402
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:37,000
 If the subset is not a frequent pattern, the superset cannot be.

2403
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:38,000
 Right?

2404
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
 Yeah.

2405
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:42,000
 So, that's the same thing.

2406
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:46,000
 So, this is the whole idea.

2407
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,000
 Okay?

2408
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:50,000
 That's why they can divide and each one do your own.

2409
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:56,000
 And then, to see whether you can identify frequent pattern can combine with my parents.

2410
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
 Like, yeah.

2411
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
 That is how you grow.

2412
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
 Okay?

2413
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,000
 Yeah.

2414
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:15,000
 I think you need to go through and go through this again to see whether you can understand this fully.

2415
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:23,000
 So, the conclusion remark is we make good use of the tree and then the growing algorithm.

2416
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:31,000
 So, basically the new data structure is stored in compressed frequent patterns.

2417
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:35,000
 So, use a tree to store the frequent patterns.

2418
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
 And then, it's very compact.

2419
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
 So, you form this.

2420
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:46,000
 And then, you use the NP growth which is to use conditional pattern base.

2421
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,000
 So, can achieve this divide and conquer idea.

2422
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,000
 Okay?

2423
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:54,000
 So, this is a method actually proposed after you have the a priori.

2424
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:57,000
 So, that was Professor Han Jiawei's team.

2425
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
 They actually did this.

2426
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,000
 Yeah.

2427
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:03,000
 And, yeah, it's increased the efficiency greatly.

2428
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,000
 Okay?

2429
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
 But now, they have more advanced.

2430
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:14,000
 I mean, on top of this, they have a more progress made and also now deep learning related, right?

2431
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:19,000
 Deep learning which is more to do is just a final recommendation and so on.

2432
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
 Yeah.

2433
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:28,000
 So, exercise, we can only discuss it next week.

2434
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,000
 Okay?

2435
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:33,000
 So, the next week we will go through all exercises which haven't covered.

2436
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:37,000
 So, you have time to go back and work on this on your own.

2437
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
 Then, you probably have better idea.

2438
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:43,000
 So, actually, you can also use a priori to do it.

2439
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,000
 Okay?

2440
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
 For this, you can actually compare.

2441
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
 You should get identical answer.

2442
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,000
 Right?

2443
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,000
 You should get the same thing.

2444
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,000
 It's just one is more efficient than another one.

2445
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
 Okay?

2446
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:00,000
 And, do you remember so far I covered two algorithm already?

2447
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:07,000
 But, what is another big task we haven't achieved for association rule mining?

2448
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,000
 The rules.

2449
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:09,000
 Right?

2450
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:14,000
 So far, we only say how to identify frequent patterns but haven't touched anything about

2451
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,000
 rule generation.

2452
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,000
 Okay?

2453
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,000
 So, rule generation, a general guideline.

2454
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:20,000
 Okay?

2455
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:24,000
 So, for any frequent pattern or frequent item set, why?

2456
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:27,000
 We can generate all the non-empty subset.

2457
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:28,000
 Okay?

2458
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:37,000
 So, non-empty subset of the Y. And then, for every non-empty subset of the X here, you

2459
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,000
 do this.

2460
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
 Okay?

2461
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:45,000
 You calculate the support of the Y divided by the header.

2462
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:46,000
 Okay?

2463
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,000
 The header of the root.

2464
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
 Support of the header root.

2465
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:52,000
 And then, you see whether this is greater than minimum confidence.

2466
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:55,000
 If it is, yeah, this is a strong root.

2467
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,000
 Okay?

2468
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,000
 Otherwise, throw away.

2469
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
 So, that is a general guideline.

2470
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:03,000
 So, of course, this one is very exhaustive way to approach, right?

2471
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:08,000
 So, we know if the K is big, there are also a lot, a lot candidates.

2472
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,000
 Yeah.

2473
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:13,000
 So, this is just a general guideline for getting the rules.

2474
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,000
 But, they have some special algorithm to speed up.

2475
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,000
 Okay?

2476
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
 But we don't have time to do that.

2477
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:26,000
 So, just understand, you know, that is a systematic way we can collect the rules.

2478
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:33,000
 So, example, here, suppose we have Y, which is three items.

2479
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:40,000
 And then, each of, so we should generate the subset for each of this, for this Y, right?

2480
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:46,000
 So, yeah, individual is one subset, and then, combination, every two combinations.

2481
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
 So, you have six of this.

2482
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
 Yeah.

2483
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:55,000
 Then, for each of these, you calculate the support.

2484
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:00,000
 So, you can see the support of this, and then divide by the header of the support,

2485
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:04,000
 and then see whether it's above the minimum confidence.

2486
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,000
 Okay?

2487
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:11,000
 So, this is how we can pick the rules.

2488
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
 So, for small K, it's okay.

2489
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:16,000
 So, small K, we can do it systematically.

2490
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
 Okay?

2491
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
 So, that's a general idea.

2492
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:28,000
 If you identify the frequent pattern, then you can check out all the possible rules associated

2493
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:31,000
 with each of the frequent patterns.

2494
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:32,000
 Okay?

2495
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:42,000
 So, that's why, second half of the exercise, the example one is to check how to get the

2496
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:48,000
 rule, which is, we want the minimum confidence is 60%.

2497
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,000
 Okay?

2498
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:53,000
 So, just now, we had, yeah.

2499
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:59,000
 So, here are those frequent patterns, and then, we can just get two rules.

2500
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
 Okay?

2501
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:05,000
 For example, you can try this one.

2502
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:08,000
 Suppose we should have every combination, right?

2503
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:15,000
 I mean, every subset of, because this one, this was a frequent pattern, we identified it.

2504
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:20,000
 So, actually, you can have all the subset of it, and then, to be the header, the rest

2505
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,000
 would be the tail, and then, check their support count.

2506
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:32,000
 So, suppose, so this one, yeah, is a 66, all greater than 60%.

2507
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:35,000
 So, these are the two possible rules.

2508
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:42,000
 So, meaning, if you buy N and W, you also can buy O. So, this is confident enough to say

2509
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,000
 that.

2510
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:50,000
 Okay, so this is, all others, you can also list out, and then, check one by one.

2511
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:51,000
 Okay?

2512
02:30:51,000 --> 02:31:02,000
 Yeah, I still want to show you a bit of the pruning, and so, previously, it was a support-based

2513
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,000
 pruning, right?

2514
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
 So, now, it's a confident-based pruning.

2515
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:11,000
 So, we are talking about, if this rule, we already know this rule is not confident.

2516
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,000
 Okay?

2517
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:21,000
 Then, if this rule is not confident, do you think, do you think any others can be pruned

2518
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:22,000
 away?

2519
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:25,000
 Anything else can be pruned away?

2520
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
 So, this is not confident already.

2521
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:36,000
 Do you think this will be confident?

2522
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:39,000
 So, you need to go back and work out.

2523
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:45,000
 The key thing is how you work out, how you calculate the confident value, right?

2524
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:52,000
 So, for calculating confidence of value of this rule, basically, it's all the items calculate

2525
02:31:52,000 --> 02:32:01,000
 the support count of the whole four items, and divide by the header.

2526
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:04,000
 So, divide by the header of the support, right?

2527
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:05,000
 So, that is the one.

2528
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:09,000
 We already know this value is less than the minimum confidence.

2529
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:10,000
 Okay?

2530
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
 Then, what about this?

2531
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:19,000
 This also, the four of them, to work out the support count.

2532
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:26,000
 Then, denominator is the header, which is C and D. So, which one is bigger?

2533
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:29,000
 Normally, this is bigger, right?

2534
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:32,000
 So, this one already too small.

2535
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
 Do you think this one will be big?

2536
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:35,000
 No.

2537
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:40,000
 So, it can only be even less than the minimum confidence.

2538
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:44,000
 So, prune, prune, prune.

2539
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
 So, those can be pruned away.

2540
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:47,000
 Okay?

2541
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:50,000
 So, this gives you an idea.

2542
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:53,000
 The rule actually can be pruned away as well.

2543
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:54,000
 Okay?

2544
02:32:54,000 --> 02:33:00,000
 And, this part can be pruned away.

2545
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:08,000
 So, this again is about how to generate the candidate's rule.

2546
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:19,000
 And then, if you know any of these, we can actually prune away some of the rules if they share the same.

2547
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:28,000
 If we know one of them is already not strong, then the combination of these two can be...

2548
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:33,000
 So, this one candidate rule can be pruned away as well.

2549
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,000
 Okay?

2550
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:39,000
 And then, the exercise 4.3 is for you to...

2551
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:44,000
 For us to try to see whether this can be pruned away.

2552
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:49,000
 And, if this is a frequent item, what are the possible candidate rules?

2553
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,000
 Okay?

2554
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:57,000
 So, again, discuss next week, and you can try to work out yourself first.

2555
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:01,000
 Last one, we want to highlight is about the lift.

2556
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,000
 Okay?

2557
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:08,000
 So, so far, we only say we identify frequent pattern because of the significance.

2558
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,000
 Right?

2559
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:12,000
 We say that they're above the some strong...

2560
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:16,000
 Show the strong pattern, I mean strong frequency.

2561
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
 So, the support count is big.

2562
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:21,000
 That's why we want to identify them.

2563
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:25,000
 Then, from them, we also want to come out with the rules.

2564
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:30,000
 But actually, those high...

2565
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:39,000
 Highly frequent occur pattern may not be interesting.

2566
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:40,000
 Okay?

2567
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
 May not be interesting.

2568
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,000
 Why?

2569
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,000
 Now, look at this table.

2570
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,000
 Okay?

2571
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:49,000
 So, we are talking about this association rule.

2572
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:52,000
 Whoever they drink tea, they also drink coffee.

2573
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:53,000
 Okay?

2574
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:57,000
 So, is this interesting rule?

2575
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:58,000
 Okay?

2576
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,000
 We ask ourselves, is this an interesting rule?

2577
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:08,000
 So, in order to work out this, actually, we want to look at the confidence of this rule.

2578
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,000
 Right?

2579
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
 So, confidence of this rule is quite high.

2580
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,000
 Quite high.

2581
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,000
 So, the...

2582
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:21,000
 But the issue is, actually, the probability of this coffee itself is also very high.

2583
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:28,000
 So, that means, actually, whether they drink coffee is because they drink tea, then they

2584
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
 drink coffee, or they just drink coffee.

2585
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,000
 You know?

2586
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:35,000
 So, when you say this rule, probably not so interesting.

2587
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:36,000
 Okay?

2588
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:39,000
 So, that's why we use another measure called lift.

2589
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:46,000
 So, lift, actually, is to work out the ratio between the confidence and support of the

2590
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,000
 why.

2591
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:48,000
 Okay?

2592
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,000
 So, be careful on here.

2593
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:56,000
 Remember, the way to calculate the confidence is a header to be in the denominator.

2594
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,000
 Okay?

2595
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:01,000
 So, here, is a why to be in the denominator.

2596
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
 Okay?

2597
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:07,000
 So, this is the confidence of the rule divides the support of the why.

2598
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,000
 Okay?

2599
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
 So, this is a way to work out the lift.

2600
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:19,000
 So, if the lift is less than one, that means it's not correlated.

2601
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
 So, it's a negatively correlated.

2602
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:22,000
 Okay?

2603
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
 So, it's not very interesting.

2604
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:28,000
 Unless it's positively correlated, it's greater than one.

2605
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
 That means this rule is interesting.

2606
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
 So, it's strong and interesting.

2607
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,000
 Okay?

2608
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:34,000
 We want to find out these rules.

2609
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:39,000
 So, this is a final example I want to show us.

2610
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:44,000
 I think we should stop here.

2611
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:48,000
 So, to summarize what we have today.

2612
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,000
 Okay?

2613
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:55,000
 So, we start to introduce you the association rule mining, especially introduce the measures,

2614
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
 actually three measures.

2615
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:01,000
 One is the support, one is confidence, one is the lift.

2616
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,000
 Okay?

2617
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:03,000
 So, those are the three.

2618
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:08,000
 So, we can use support to pick up those frequent items.

2619
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:09,000
 Okay?

2620
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:15,000
 So, frequent items, that means those items, they are significant enough for us to pay attention

2621
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:16,000
 to.

2622
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:17,000
 Okay?

2623
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:20,000
 Then, we based on that, we can work out the rules.

2624
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:23,000
 So, we want to only select the strong rules.

2625
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:27,000
 Strong rules actually indicate the association between items.

2626
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,000
 Okay?

2627
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
 So, we want to put strong rules.

2628
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:37,000
 And then, we introduce you the third measure, actually, to double confirm whether the rule

2629
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:41,000
 itself is a strong rule itself, is that interesting or not.

2630
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,000
 Okay?

2631
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:52,000
 And then, we introduce two algorithms to quickly or efficiently without using exhausted way

2632
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:56,000
 to actually identify frequent pattern.

2633
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:59,000
 That's all we covered today.

2634
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:07,000
 So, that is the whole summary for this topic four.

2635
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:13,000
 So, basically introduce those concepts and then talk about focus on association rule

2636
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
 mining, then the two algorithms.

2637
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:22,000
 And then, for rule generation, you know, after the frequent pattern is identified, then systematically

2638
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:26,000
 generate the rule and then pick the interesting one.

2639
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:27,000
 Okay?

2640
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:31,000
 So, this is a summary for this.

2641
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:34,000
 And hybrid, okay?

2642
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:40,000
 So, neural network actually can be applied to association rule mining.

2643
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:41,000
 Okay?

2644
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
 So, they can think of the way.

2645
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
 So, this is, I asked ChessGVT, okay?

2646
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:48,000
 Hopefully, this is the updated one.

2647
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:53,000
 So, they actually say you probably can have a way to embed the rule into neural network

2648
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:56,000
 or using the graph neural network.

2649
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,000
 Okay?

2650
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
 So, actually the associations, the relationship.

2651
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:06,000
 Actually, you can see these two are very much in apply now together with large language

2652
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
 model.

2653
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:08,000
 Okay?

2654
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
 Large language model together with graph neural network model.

2655
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:19,000
 Or, very, very hot topic in like apply the knowledge graph together with large language

2656
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:20,000
 model.

2657
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:21,000
 Okay?

2658
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
 To improve the performance of large language model.

2659
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:30,000
 But this is definitely where improve the overall recommendation system.

2660
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:31,000
 Okay?

2661
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
 So, this is purely for your information.

2662
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:34,000
 Okay?

2663
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:41,000
 It's nothing to do with exam and it's beyond the scope because this class suppose it just

2664
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:42,000
 introduce introduction.

2665
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:43,000
 Okay?

2666
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:51,000
 So, after we have this association rule mining together with deep learning, then can apply

2667
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
 to many real world applications.

2668
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:54,000
 Okay?

2669
02:39:54,000 --> 02:40:03,000
 And also the model like, yeah, still using the GNN graph neural network or transformer

2670
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
 to design these things.

2671
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:08,000
 And you can also think about what is the disadvantage.

2672
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:09,000
 Right?

2673
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:10,000
 Yeah?

2674
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:11,000
 Okay.

2675
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
 I think I should stop here.

2676
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:19,000
 Although you have the slides which is to talk about what is the maximum frequency item

2677
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,000
 set.

2678
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:26,400
 The way is to tell us if you just need to store, if you have a very limited space, you just

2679
02:40:26,400 --> 02:40:32,000
 want to store some of the, you know, frequent items, then the rest can be automatically

2680
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,000
 generated.

2681
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:34,000
 Okay?

2682
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:35,000
 So, you don't need to store all.

2683
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:36,000
 Yeah?

2684
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
 So, this is one to tell us that.

2685
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:45,600
 And then we can, yeah, so it's a small set of the frequent items should be stored and

2686
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:47,000
 then the rest can derived.

2687
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:48,000
 Okay?

2688
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,000
 So, that is the idea.

2689
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:56,000
 And then the close of frequent item set, that is, if you don't want to recalculate the support,

2690
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:57,000
 then that is a subset.

2691
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:01,000
 You need to, the minimum set of the item you need to store.

2692
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:02,000
 Okay?

2693
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:08,000
 So, basically, this one, this one, actually, you still need to recalculate the support

2694
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:11,000
 value for your generated patterns.

2695
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,000
 Okay?

2696
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:15,000
 Purely for your information, yeah, it's not examinable.

2697
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
 So, it's totally extra information.

2698
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:21,000
 Just to say you don't really need to store all of the frequent items, they can be generated.

2699
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:22,000
 Okay?

2700
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:25,000
 Based on the principle, you can actually generate it.

2701
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:31,000
 So, if you don't want to recalculate the support value, then this is another concept related

2702
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:32,000
 to that.

2703
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:33,000
 Okay?

2704
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:34,000
 Yeah?

2705
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,000
 That's all.

2706
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:41,000
 For today, yeah, a bit, drag, a bit too long, okay, without too much stress here.

2707
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:42,000
 Okay?

2708
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,000
 So, hopefully you bear with me.

2709
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:46,000
 So, basically, I cover all the contents now.

2710
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:51,000
 Next week, it's just purely for cover all the discussions and exercises.

2711
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,000
 Okay?

2712
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,000
 Then, Prof Tang with Ticklebar.

2713
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:59,000
 Next week, he's, the last two hours, he will Ticklebar.

2714
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,000
 Okay?

2715
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:04,000
 So, for my part, this is a plan for next week.

2716
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,000
 And then we have the quiz.

2717
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:10,000
 So, I still need to keep you informed about the actual, which session, the location.

2718
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,000
 Okay?

2719
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:14,000
 The time, exact time you need to go.

2720
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:15,000
 Yeah?

2721
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,000
 Thank you very much.

2722
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,000
 Thank you.

2723
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:18,000
 Thanks.

2724
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
 Oh, no, that is.

2725
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
 Okay?

2726
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
 Okay?

2727
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
 Okay?

2728
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
 Okay?

2729
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
 Okay?

2730
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
 Okay?

2731
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
 Okay?

2732
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
 Okay?

2733
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
 Okay?

2734
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
 Okay?

2735
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
 Okay?

2736
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
 Okay?

2737
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
 Okay?

2738
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
 Okay?

2739
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
 Okay?

2740
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
 Okay?

2741
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
 Okay?

2742
