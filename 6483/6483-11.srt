1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Hey, no, it's not.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 All right.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 All right.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I think we can get started.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Welcome back.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I hope you had a great public holiday yesterday.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Also, I believe a protest already introduced various methods on

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 neural networks, supervised learning, and now we are coming

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 back to maybe have a better understanding of those learning.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 But since the last time I met you was like four weeks ago,

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 or five weeks ago, so week six, I just want to, before I start

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 my own lecture today, I just want to have a quick recap on things

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I cover on week six, make sure you still have a good memory

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 of those things.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And as usual, for my part, through through the ask question.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 You can ask a question anytime you want, so you don't need to

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 wait until the end, so just raise your hand.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I'm happy to clarify any question you have.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 All right, so I hope you still remember, in week six, we talk

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 about several methods on supervised learning.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 We talk about clustering methods.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 We also talk about linear regression.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And I say that for clustering, you need to know the two

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 methodologies that we covered, and those are the only two,

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 which represents the partition-based method and also the

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 hierarchical clustering methods.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 So the first one is K-means, right?

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I hope you still remember what is K-means.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 A few key points for K-means method are, you need to know

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 that K-means, of course, is very different from the SVM or

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 neural networks you just learned from Prof. Tan.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 It's unsupervised.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 In other words, you will not need labels in the training.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 That's a major difference between supervised and unsupervised

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 methods.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 And the K-means also need a parameter, which is the K.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 You need to know the number of clusters before using them.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And also, you also need to specify the distance metric.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 So in most cases, in this subject, we're going to use Euclidean

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 distance, unless we specify in the question.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And one important thing for K-means is that you have to

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 care about how you initialize the algorithm.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And you do need an initialization.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 That's the very first step before running into the iterative

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 steps.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And usually, by saying initialization, we're talking

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 about initializing the centers.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 So for example, you have K clusters.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 You need to initialize what are the starting point of those K

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 centroids.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 So they must be specified.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And different initialization will affect your final results.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Because we know that K-means is very sensitive to the

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 initialization.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And remember the output of your K-means method.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Suppose you see one question in the exam.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And the exam asks you what is the output.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 You need to specify two things.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 So one is the membership for every data sample you have.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 So for every data you have in the question, there must be

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 associated to a specific cluster and only one, all right?

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Exact one cluster.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And you also need to tell us what are the learned centroids

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 for every cluster.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 So both of them you need to specify.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And that's the full, complete answers.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And also make sure you specify when you stop.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Give us the stopping criteria.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 So these are basically the key points you need to know.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 In order to make sure you get the answer properly addressed in

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 your final exam.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And another thing we learned is HAC.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 So HAC is another different approach compared to K-means,

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 but it's also for clustering.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And a few highlights or differences compared to K-means is

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 that first, it doesn't need any initialization.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 It's kind of deterministic.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 The algorithm always give you the same answer if data samples

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 are fixed.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I mean, other things are similar.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 For example, you also need, because this is an unsupervised

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 method, so you need a collection of data, but you do not need

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 labels.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 So it's like data without labels.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And you also need to specify distance metric.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 But this distance metric is slightly different.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 So when we talk about HAC, you need a distance metric, not just

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 between samples, but between clusters.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Because later we'll see some examples.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 But we basically learned for kind of distance, like inter-cluster

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 distance, the centroid, max, min, and average.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 So make sure you know what they are.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 You can tell the difference.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And for any of them giving the question, you know how to update

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 your distance table, how to come up with the cluster updates.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And, well, this distance metric well-determined how you merge

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 the clusters.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 So make sure you know, you can decide how to merge the cluster

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 from the distance table.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 So we say that from distance table, you can tell which pair of

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 clusters, the one with the minimum distance, and how to

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 visualize them.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 We talk about visualization, but of course, with only two

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 dimensional data, or maybe one dimensional data, you can

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 visualize them.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 And a very unique thing for HAC is that you can always come up

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 with a dendrogram.

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So the dendrogram, well, trace or kind of track all of this

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 merging process right in the beginning and all the way until,

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 let's say, only one cluster remains.

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 So if you have this dendrogram, you can actually get the result

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 for any number of cluster you like.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 So make sure you know how to interpret the dendrogram, and

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 also you can kind of plot the dendrogram from your

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 clustering process.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 So again, stopping criteria.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 But stopping criteria for HAC is quite simple.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 You just need to stop either when you only have one cluster

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 left, or if the question say, well, I need two clusters, then

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 you stop at two clusters.

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 So these are some of the things you just want to use them to

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 refresh your memories and make sure you know what I'm talking

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 about.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Every key point, those are something quite important when you

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 answer the question.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 You have to make sure they are covered in your answer.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 So these are some recap.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 So I actually give some examples, if you remember, in week

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 six.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 This is actually the four data sample example I gave.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And I show you how to do the HAC using the central distance and

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 average link.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Remember?

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Though I give these two examples in the lecture slides in week

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 six, because they are actually more complicated.

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 The reason I show these two is because actually using central

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 distance and average linkage actually is more complicated

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 because you have updated the central, it's calculating

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 average.

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And I didn't show the mean and the max distance because they

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 are relatively simpler.

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 But I still receive some questions where people ask how can

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 we do with the first two.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So I will use the same example.

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I show you in week six.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 But let's try using the single linkage and also complete

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 linkage.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 In other words, mean distance and max distance.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Let's see how they are different.

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 So in the beginning, any distance metric, as long as you are

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 doing HAC, the very first step is always the same.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 No difference.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 You have to come up with this distance table.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Of course, you only need, let's say, a lower triangle or

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 upper triangle because it's actually symmetric.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 But you need to calculate the point-wise distance in this

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 table.

158
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 So basically, if you have four points, you will need a four

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 by four matrix, but only the lower triangle, all of this value

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 to be calculated by comparing the distance between every two

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 samples you have.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 That's the same.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 That's always the same, no matter what inter cluster distance

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 you choose.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Now starting from this table, you can make a decision, say,

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 whichever give you the smallest distance, that's going to be

167
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 the pair of points you're going to merge.

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 So in this case, by comparing all of these non-zero numbers,

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 you can tell that the first merge is always 1 and 2.

170
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 That's kind of the same, no matter what distance you use.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Now starting from step two, this step makes a difference.

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Depends on what inter-class distance you are using.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 The procedure of making the second move will be different.

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 So if you remember, we talk about centroid distance.

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 If you are using centroid distance, you need to update the

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 centroids of this new cluster by merging 1 and 2.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 So basically, you need to compute the new center and

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 recalculate the distance.

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Now if it's not centroid distance, if it's average, mean,

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 and max, you don't have to explicitly compute the new center,

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 which makes the things easier.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 But you just need to update the distance table accordingly.

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 But how to update the distance table?

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 I hope you still remember for the average case, what we did is

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 that if we want to know the distance between, let's say,

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 1, 2, and 3, if we want to know the new distance between 1, 2,

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 and 3, the way we do that is by taking the average of distance

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 1, 3, which is here.

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 You can read from the first table.

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 This is your first distance table in step one.

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 You can extract or calculate this new distance directly from

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 the first table by simply taking the average of distance 1,

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 3, which is here, and the distance between 2, 3, which is here.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 So you just simply take the average of these two numbers.

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 That's how you get the 0.79, which is the distance between 3 and 1, 2.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 So you just need to take the average, but you don't have to

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 recalculate or update the new center.

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 The new center is not needed.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Make sense?

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 This is the recap.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I got the same thing in week six.

202
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 It's a recap.

203
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And then you can do the same thing for distance between 1, 2, and 4.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 So between 1, 2, and 4, similarly, you take the average over 1, 4, and 2, 4.

205
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 You take the average of these two numbers.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 That gives you the 1.24.

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 So this is your average distance.

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 The average distance, let's say, between x, y, and z.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 x plus y and z is equal to the average between x and z and y and z.

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Very simple.

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Make sense?

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 So make sure you know how to do it.

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Next time, it may not be 1 and 2.

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Next time, it may be 2 and 3.

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 But the principle is very similar.

216
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Now, how about the other two distance metric?

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 So how about, let's say, well, this is average.

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 So basically, this is the average.

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I already showed you.

220
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 You take the average of these two.

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 You can get the output here.

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Now, if we're talking about not average, but the mean, we say that

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 another way to calculate the inter-cluster distance is by looking

224
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 at what is the minimum.

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 What's the minimum pair of points between the two clusters?

226
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Now, if we are using the minimum distance, it's even simpler.

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Remember, previously, we're taking the average.

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Now, if it's a mean, you don't need to take average, but you take the mean.

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 So if it's a mean distance between 1, 2, and 3, it will be the

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 mean of distance 1, 3, and distance 2, 3.

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 So just compare the two, whichever give you the smaller

232
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 distance, that's become the final distance.

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 So now you have this 0.72 coming directly from the previous

234
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 distance between 1 and 3.

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Make sense?

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Then similarly, the other pairs, you can just take the

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 minimum of these two guys, whichever is smaller, make them

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 the distance between your new cluster and then 4.

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 So basically, you need to identify what are the two numbers you need,

240
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 then depends on the inter-cluster distance.

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Either you take average or you take the mean, or another way

242
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 is that you can take the max.

243
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 If you take the max, similarly, you just pick the bigger one,

244
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 all of the two.

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 So that's how you can do the mean distance and max distance.

246
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 It's even simpler, but all of the average, mean, and max,

247
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 they are actually simpler because you don't have to calculate

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 the centroid.

249
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 You can directly derive the new distance from the distance

250
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 table in your step 1.

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Is it clear?

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Because some people ask me, so I think it's better to clarify here.

253
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 So same principle, but you have to be very clear about what distance

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 you are talking about.

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Make that distance correspondingly and don't confuse yourself.

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 You cannot just change the distance.

257
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 It must be the same, specified by the question.

258
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 OK, great.

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Again, you will be very likely to see one question, at least,

260
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 in clustering, so make sure these two, k-means, h-a-c, you are familiar with.

261
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 This is the only thing I can tell you.

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 You will have one question about that point.

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Now, another thing we talk about in week six is the linear regression.

264
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 So linear regression is kind of a different problem.

265
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 It's not about labels.

266
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 It's about the continuous value.

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 You want to predict what is the, say, underlying y using the parameters

268
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 x to predict it.

269
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 And then if you assume that the model itself is linear, in other words,

270
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 you are having a line defined by the vector w and b,

271
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 you can actually predict the y by using a simple linear combination,

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 right?

273
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 x times y, sorry, x times w plus b.

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And so if we need to have a training process to obtain this w,

275
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 and we say that to do so, usually you need to have a training data set,

276
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 like a list of x and a list of y.

277
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And the way you train the w is by solving a mean square,

278
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 sorry, least square problem.

279
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 In other words, you are trying to minimize the mean square arrow

280
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 between your prediction, remember your linear regression,

281
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 the prediction is always w multiplied by x, basically it's

282
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 like inner product of the two plus b and distance between that

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 with the underlying yi, right?

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 You make the difference, you take the square, and then you want

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 to make sure that w you have is going to minimize this arrow

286
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 over the entire data set, the training data set, right?

287
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And that's how you can catch a w, right?

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And well, remember that we show a figure, right, in the plot,

289
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 if we are using the two-dimensional data, you can plot all of this

290
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 x and y in the 2D space, and we say that the actual arrow we are

291
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 minimizing, in fact, is the vertical arrow, right?

292
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Remember we say that?

293
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 So make sure you don't confuse it with the PCA

294
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 that we're going to see maybe next week, all right?

295
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 So the reason is these arrows are entirely in the y-dimension.

296
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 So vertical offset means the arrow in the y-direction, okay?

297
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 So in fact, all of these arrow are minimizing, it's the actual

298
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 point, the distance vertically from the point itself to the

299
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 projection onto the y, right?

300
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Sorry, not projection, I mean the vertical axis.

301
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 If you draw a vertical line, intersection with the linear

302
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 regression, that's the distance we have, okay?

303
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And we also quickly describe how you can derive this w.

304
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I mean, this is optional.

305
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I will not give you any questions specifically on

306
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 deriving the w, but for those who want to know this, right,

307
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 we say that there's actually a closed form solution to come up

308
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 with the optimal line, right, the w, is by first simplifying

309
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 this linear regression formulation by absorbing the wang

310
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 into the x, and now if you do so, you can formulate this matrix

311
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 vector multiplication, you know, linear kind of a, linear

312
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 algebra kind of regression, and now solving this problem is

313
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 nothing but finding a gradient and then making a gradient

314
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 equal to zero, right?

315
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 So if you do so, you can do a simply a matrix inversion of

316
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 the x transpose x.

317
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Of course, this x is the data matrix by concoilating all of

318
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 the x you have, and then as long as this x transpose x does

319
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 have an inverse, right, matrix inverse exists, your w will be

320
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 equal to nothing but the pseudo inverse of x multiplied by y,

321
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 right, so that's going to be the closed form solution of your

322
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 linear regression.

323
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 So suppose you want to use them for your project, you can

324
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 basically try this formula, right, it's very simple.

325
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 You don't even need to do any kind of gradient descent, right?

326
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 But, okay, again, this is not going to be tested, but good

327
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 for you to know, and I also got one question from the student

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 asking, well, can you give some example, right, like how

329
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 exact is this so-called linear, sorry, least square solution

330
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 can be calculated?

331
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 I give you like a quick example, right, so maybe you can

332
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 get a feel like how this formula can be applied, right?

333
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So suppose we have, let's say, three data samples, right, just

334
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 three, and every data sample will have a corresponding

335
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 near x and y, so suppose this is my data one, data two, and

336
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 data three, I got three data samples, so how can I use the

337
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 three data samples to construct my w, which is my linear

338
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 regressor, how can I use this formula?

339
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Well, you need to do actually three steps, all right, the

340
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 first step is to form a, you know, modify the x to incorporate

341
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 all of the samples, and what we're talking about is to

342
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 incorporate x and y together, right, remember, this is

343
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 what we did here, we have to concoinate the x with the

344
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 extra one here to incorporate it, so what we do here is by

345
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 incorporating the original x, right, zero one two with the

346
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 one adding to it, right, that's the step one, you make sure

347
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 the x is augmented with the extra offset, right, the

348
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 biostern, and step two is to formulate this data matrix x

349
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 and data vector y, so the matrix x will be nothing but

350
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 concatenating your x one, x two, and x three, right, this is

351
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 how you form this three by two matrix, now y vector is even

352
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 simpler, you just concatenate all of the label y, right,

353
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 your y one, y two, y three together as a vector, now the

354
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 only thing left is by applying the pseudo inverse, right, you

355
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 just need to calculate what is x transpose times x, this is

356
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 how you get your x transpose x, and you do an inversion, right,

357
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 you do an inversion of it, and then multiply by x transpose,

358
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 all right, and doing so, this becomes your w, right, the w is

359
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 very simple, this is nothing but just, you know, a vector one

360
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 one, right, that's how you can get your linear line, which is

361
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 exactly 45 degrees, right, so it's just one example for those

362
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 of you who are interested in giving a try, but again, i won't

363
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 give you any question like this, but this is some kind of example

364
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 to tell you that what really this closed form solution means,

365
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 right, okay, just for your curiosity, all right, and you

366
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 can see that all of these calculations are very simple, except

367
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 for this matrix inverse, right, so matrix inverse may take

368
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 a lot of time, but there's many solvers for getting the inverse,

369
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 okay, but sometimes the inverse may not exist, right, especially

370
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 when your matrix becomes super large, you need to make sure the matrix

371
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 itself has full rank, right, you cannot have any row or column

372
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 which is dependent, right, all of them must be independent, okay, so

373
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 I think that's all i want to recap for our week six, again if you

374
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 have any questions, feel free to ask me, we're going to have a break later,

375
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 or maybe in the class, so you can raise your hand, i'm happy to answer any question.

376
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Now, moving forward, starting from this week, i hope

377
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 i can cover most of them, but maybe not, so we're going to continue next week,

378
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 it's about, you know, how we can get the training

379
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 done right, all right, so you have learned

380
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 like SVM training neural networks like bag propagation,

381
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 i believe with neural networks with proptan, right, you have learned all of this,

382
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 and you know that one can actually train a neural network

383
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 by having a bunch of data, right, you can do BP, you can calculate

384
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 the gradients, you can update the weights to come up with a learned model,

385
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 okay, so everything seems to be pretty well defined, but

386
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 the next question is that how do we know the

387
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 learned model is working properly, okay, so in the project

388
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 you also have this kind of question, right, you come up with some, you know,

389
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 neural network with several layers, and many people even

390
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 ask me, say, hey, is it four-layer enough, right, is it like a three-channel

391
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 enough, so in the end you need to have the knowledge

392
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 to tell the answer, right, you cannot ask me, right, so this week

393
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 i'm going to tell you what's the tool, or what's the way to analyze

394
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 whether your model learned is working properly, or in other words

395
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 have you done, have you do it right when you learn the model, and how can you tell

396
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 it, and how can you quantify the amount of error

397
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 you get from your models, okay, so this is

398
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 what i mean by optimize the training model you have, and how to regularize the training

399
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 process to prevent some question from happening, okay, so these are

400
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 the main topics i'm going to do starting from this week,

401
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 so here's the outer line, right, so we're going to first kind of

402
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 formally define the pipeline of supervised training,

403
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 okay, because all of this thing i'm talking about is mainly for supervised training,

404
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 okay, supervised training means all the things you learn with pro 10, like

405
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 SVM, in your networks, but not something to do with what i teach

406
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 in week six, right, so what i did in week six is all unsupervised,

407
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 okay, this is supervised, so we're going to formally define it, and also even

408
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 mathematically define it, and then we're going to look at the two major

409
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 part of the error you will have, right, so whatever model

410
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 you get, if the model is not doing well, means that there's some error

411
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 in your prediction, the error comes from these two parts,

412
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 it's either the bios or the variance, okay, so remember

413
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 bios and variance are the two major components of your model

414
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 error, right, so later we're going to see what are they and where they come

415
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 from, and then due to the fact that these

416
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 errors may play a role in your model, right, your model could suffer

417
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 either from underfeeding or overfeeding, okay, you may

418
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 have heard of this term many times, that people use the term overfeeding, underfeeding to

419
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 characterize, okay, what is wrong with the model, right, so what is wrong with

420
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 the training process, so these two are the main phenomenon

421
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 you probably will observe, maybe in your project, in your other kind of

422
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 practice, practical training, and we're going to see where they come from, and

423
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 how can we make a call, right, how can we know this is overfeeding or

424
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 underfeeding, I'm going to introduce a very

425
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 introductory level of this theoretical analysis about

426
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 formally defined bios and variance, so I'm going to use some

427
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 simple tool of statistical learning, but it's optional, okay, so I

428
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 don't ask everybody to know it, and I won't give any question on that, but it's really

429
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 good for you to understand, you know, formally

430
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 what do I mean by bios and variance, okay, I would say very useful, but

431
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 because it involves some math, so I don't really, I won't really test on it,

432
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 okay, but so I put them as optional, so last but not least, we're going to

433
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 use all of this knowledge we learn to see that in practice

434
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 if you observe something in your training, model training, or maybe

435
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 your model behavior, right, during the training, how can we do

436
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 model diagnosis, in other words, how can we tell that this training is wrong

437
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 or something happened, alright, and correspondingly

438
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 how can we make it correct, what should we do to improve it,

439
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 or maybe to get it done correctly, alright, so this will be

440
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 the topic I'm going to do this week and also next week, okay,

441
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 so here are some questions, as usual, I wish

442
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 you to keep in mind, and also we should be able to answer by the

443
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 end of the lecture, right, so including what are the types of supervision,

444
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 so in total I'm going to introduce four types, okay, and

445
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 how to measure the degree of overfitting, so in other words,

446
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 how can we quantify the amount of overfitting the model is suffering from,

447
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 okay, and last but not least, if we know there's overfitting,

448
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 what is the method to prevent overfitting, or at least to alleviate overfitting,

449
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 alright, so these are some of the questions, let's answer together, right, after the

450
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 lecture, okay, so I will start by introducing

451
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 or review the supervised learning framework,

452
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 so from what we learned so far, right, my part, prof10's part, you should know that,

453
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 for example, the classification you learned, let's say

454
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 using SVM or neural network is supervised, and

455
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 the symbol for that is you always need a training

456
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 data with predefined labels in the training,

457
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 I mean that's the common thing, no matter you're doing SVM or neural network, you have to

458
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 have a data set with many, many samples involving

459
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 both the sample themselves and the underlying labels,

460
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 okay, that's the common thing, whereas the clustering

461
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 method we just recap, like HAC or K-Means,

462
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 is unsupervised, in other words, we won't have any preexisting

463
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 label, we don't need them, we just need the sample points, and we can

464
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 do them for training, right, that's the main difference, so now

465
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I'm going to focus on the first category, so in other words, I'm going to

466
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 focus on supervised training for the entire analysis I'm talking about,

467
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 in other words, we are at this

468
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 side, so if I'm going to use this dimension to summarize

469
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 those kind of type of supervision, unsupervised learning is like

470
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 the least restrictive things, you don't need

471
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 any label on the left-hand side of this axis,

472
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 the supervised training is on the right-hand side of this axis, in other words, you need

473
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 a complete training label for the tasks you want to do,

474
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 alright, so we have covered both of them, some of the

475
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 examples we have talked about, but we also have something in between,

476
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 I wish you to be aware of that, so in between there could be some

477
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 cases, for example, you may have labels, but you only have the label

478
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 for a small portion of your training data, suppose

479
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 you have 1000 samples in your training data, you only know the labels, maybe for

480
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 200, sorry, maybe 50 of them, like a small portion,

481
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 majority of them are unlabeled, so if you are training over

482
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 these kind of set, we call it a semi-supervised training,

483
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 so there's another kind of something between, it's called semi-supervised

484
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 means that the labels are partially available, only a few

485
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 of them are available, there's another category we call the weekly

486
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 supervised, I believe you heard of this term, like frequently, but the definition

487
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 for weekly supervised means you have a label for

488
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 all of the samples you got in the training, but those labels

489
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 could be noisy, in other words, the label could be right or could be wrong,

490
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 and the label could

491
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 be not exactly for the tasks you are interested, it could be

492
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 labeled for some other tasks but relevant, so these kind of

493
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 scenarios we call it the weekly supervised, alright, so all of these are not

494
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 quite ideal but you still have something, so

495
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 that's kind of the four scenarios if you read the literatures,

496
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 so basically these are the four most commonly seen scenarios

497
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 of supervision, but just wish to know that the

498
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 supervised training is actually the best scenario or the most ideal

499
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 scenario, everything is clean and you have all the labels, but we still

500
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 have two things in between, so you can actually memorize this using this one-dimensional

501
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 axis, alright, but now talking about

502
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 completely supervised training, so let's just recap what

503
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 we learned from prof10, we're talking about

504
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 have input, so for example if we are using the image classification as an example,

505
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 the pipeline is always taking the image as input

506
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 and the output will be the corresponding label, predicted label

507
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 of that image, so this is like a very classic supervised

508
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 image classification problem setting, you give the image

509
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 as input, the model predicts the desired output as a label

510
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 but to do so, to come up with the model

511
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 doing that, we always need a stage, we call it the training,

512
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 so you heard of this term training many times, and the

513
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 training in the supervised setting will be the following,

514
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 so we're talking about using a sample, the

515
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 images, not the label, we use the images, we will represent them using

516
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 whatever models we have, and we're trying to compare

517
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 with the training labels, I mean the ground-truth label we have,

518
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 we want to make them similar, like minimizing some errors or minimizing some

519
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 loss, such that we find the best model

520
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 that can represent all of these samples, and also the best model

521
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 to make the decision, think about SVM, your decision

522
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 boundary, that's something you want to learn, so bear in mind that

523
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 for the training process, you well know the label, so the training process

524
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 do not need to create any labels, the labels are given,

525
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 the purpose of training is to finalize

526
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 the model you learned, the purpose or the output

527
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 of the training is the learned model, so that's the major difference,

528
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 and then we use the model for testing,

529
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 the next thing is the testing stage, the testing stage

530
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 is fix the model you get from the training, you don't touch

531
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 the model, and you use the learned model to generate

532
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 the label prediction, so let's make them very clear,

533
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 training step, no need to worry about the labels, the labels will be given,

534
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 our purpose is to create or generate the learned model, and the testing

535
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 is talking about using the model you learned in the training, create

536
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 the prediction you have in the testing data set, so this

537
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 is like the general pipeline for all of the supervised training we talk about,

538
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 in this subject at least, and this is like the

539
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 illustration, I'm illustrating this using the

540
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 flow chart, now let's try to make it a little bit mathematics,

541
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 so instead of doing this hand-waving description

542
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 of training and testing, mathematically we

543
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 can represent the model we are talking about as a function, f,

544
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 here the function f, we use a function

545
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 f to represent the model we are talking about, I mean this f

546
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 can be very different from using different models, like SVM, this f will

547
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 be your support vector machine for predicting the label,

548
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 and it depends on your model, the neural network, f will be

549
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 your multilayer neural network taking the input and generating the output,

550
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 and all of this model we are talking about in machine

551
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 learning, they will be parameterized,

552
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 in other words they will involve some parameters that you can

553
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 set or you can learn, so we use the symbol

554
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 theta to denote the actual model parameters,

555
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 so think about this theta as your neuron,

556
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 weights or bios term, these are characterized

557
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 as the theta, so f theta denotes the

558
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 actual model you are using, and of course you can use your input

559
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 as x, denotes output as y, so the entire

560
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 classification process can be described

561
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 using this one line equation, mathematically,

562
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 now what is the training, the training process is

563
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 nothing but given a training set of label sample, in other words

564
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 I will give you a, let's say n pairs of x and y,

565
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 x1, y1, x2, y2, all the way to x and yn,

566
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 and the purpose of training is nothing

567
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 but estimating the theta by

568
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 making the right prediction over this

569
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 pairs, so remember the purpose of training here

570
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 mathematically is to determine the theta, that's the purpose of

571
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 training, so you don't touch x and y, x and y are given

572
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 you want to determine the theta, once the theta is finalized you are done with

573
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 the training, now testing or sometimes we

574
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 call it inference is to apply the learned f theta

575
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 nothing changed there, it's fixed, now we want

576
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 to apply them to some new samples or unseen samples

577
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 x, and now predict the corresponding y

578
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 for those x in the testing, so this is what we

579
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 refer as testing, the testing means fix f theta, apply them

580
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 to the x, generate the y for the testing data set

581
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 so let's make it very clear, and then

582
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 this is nothing but the mathematical description of the previous

583
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 pipeline we are talking about, and we summarize them, so here the f can be anything

584
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 all of the model we have learned, depends on what they are, they will have corresponding form

585
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 and then they will have corresponding different parameters of theta, but in general

586
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 this will be the mathematical description of the supervised training process

587
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 so I will using this notation for many of the

588
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 analysis I'm going to do, so let's just keep this in mind, and this is the

589
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 convention, now we know that we have now

590
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 described the learning process, and we

591
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 can actually learn the theta using the specific methods for specific

592
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 models, but like I mentioned, we are

593
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 not very sure, sometimes the model you learn could work very well

594
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 sometimes the model you get may not work so properly, and

595
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 here what we want to understand is that what are the potential problems

596
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 when you learn the theta from the training

597
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 samples, x and y, so what could be wrong, or what

598
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 could be the possible problems that you encounter during the training

599
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 so welcome to see a few, the first one we call

600
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 this overfilling, and overfilling happens when you

601
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 don't have sufficient data for a specific model, in other words

602
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 for a specific f and theta, you may not have sufficient

603
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 x, so illustratively

604
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 the case is that well, you only have a few samples, and it

605
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 depends on how you decide to feed them, you can feed them

606
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 into a very restrictive way, or you can make them like a

607
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 quite funny way, so this kind of problem that because you

608
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 don't have enough data, somehow you feed the model in a very

609
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 funny way, that's usually referred as overfilling, so this is

610
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 like the intuitive way, we're going to define them later

611
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 formally, but overfilling is one of the major issues, or major

612
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 problems when you don't have sufficient data for a specific

613
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 model, that's the number one, number two is the opposite,

614
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 the opposite is that your data may be enough, or maybe

615
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 sufficient, but your model

616
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 themselves may not be rich enough, in other words the model

617
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 could be too simple sometimes, so here's one example, you

618
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 have some data samples, and the data sample themselves

619
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 underline model of them will be like a second order, let's say

620
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 polynomial, but because you insist to learn

621
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 a linear regression over the sample, so no matter how

622
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 much you adjust this line, this line cannot feed the

623
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 sample very accurately, it's due to the fact that you are

624
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 limiting your model complexity to just a line,

625
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 and using a too simple or not rich enough

626
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 model to solve the problem, that's the issue we call

627
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 underfilling, so these are the two major things we may

628
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 encounter in practice, so now we're going to see

629
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 we should understand what really happened, so basically we need to know the mechanism

630
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 causing these two problems when you do learning,

631
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 that's the purpose of what we do today, so let's see first

632
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 where does this error come from, so we know that due to these two facts

633
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 there could be something wrong, there could be some errors, let's see where this error comes from in the first place, now

634
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 in practice there are two main challenges

635
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 preventing us to get the correct model or accurate model,

636
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 so number one, the challenge is that in practice

637
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 if we are given a bunch of data without prior knowledge, we will

638
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 never know the exact model, meaning the true model, really mapping from

639
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 x to y, because there could be some mechanism, but we have

640
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 no idea, we just have the data, we have no idea what is the underlying true model

641
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 that exact mapping from x to y, we have to guess, so

642
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 that's actually one of the limitations that we always encounter

643
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 in practice, the second challenge we encounter is that

644
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 we will never know the true distribution of the data,

645
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 in other words I give you a bunch of samples, we only know the measure

646
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 we have over those lesser few, but what exactly is the true distribution

647
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 of the model, based on the limited measurement we have no idea

648
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 about it, so these are two fundamental limitations that

649
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 physically impossible to know them exactly,

650
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 now what happens, so for example if we have the first challenge

651
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 what we do in practice, we have to do something to overcome them

652
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 so what we do in practice to overcome the

653
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 first challenge is by always making certain assumption of our

654
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 model, because we don't know exactly the true model, so we have to assume something

655
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 for example you may usually assume that your

656
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 classifier is let's say linear, or your classifier itself is

657
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 like a two level neural network, so this is the assumption

658
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 you make, you believe your assumption is right, but your assumption

659
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 will be deviate or maybe deviate from the exact model

660
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 so these assumptions, we will make assumption, we need to make

661
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 assumption to determine the model architecture, but we have to bear in

662
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 mind that this is assumption, this is not the truth, so that's the

663
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 gap one, from what you do in practice and what really

664
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 happened in practice, that's the assumption one, now what

665
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 we do for the second challenge is that we, it says we do not

666
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 know the actual distribution of the data, remember all of this loss function

667
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 we use in the training are usually just based on

668
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 the average over the training data we have, remember

669
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 we talk about this linear regression, we say that linear regression is nothing but the

670
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 mean square error, while minimizing the mean square error, average over all the

671
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 sample we have, so we usually just minimize

672
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 the error that is average over the training sample, in other words

673
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 every sample you have share the same weights, we simply want to

674
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 make sure the average error is minimized, so this is something we call

675
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 empirical minimization or empirical risk minimization, but

676
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 bear in mind that this is different from directly

677
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 measure the distribution difference, because distribution

678
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 in terms of distribution some of the sample may appear more likely, some of the sample may

679
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 appear less frequently, we do not know this information so we have to treat

680
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 them equally, okay now these two

681
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 will solve the problem but they will introduce some

682
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 gap, in other words some deviation from your assumption

683
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 compared to what actually happens in the sample, now

684
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 each of them, right so we have challenge number one because the model

685
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 we do not know for sure, challenge two we do not know exact data distribution, we only know

686
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 the limited measurements, they will be corresponding

687
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 or the approximation you make will be corresponding to the

688
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 two major errors that we usually talk about in machine learning,

689
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 alright so the first error we call it a bias

690
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 so one thing I want to make sure is that you use the term

691
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 bias in let's say neural network, I hope it's different

692
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 so here the bias and variance are not about

693
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 the data, okay all of these bias and variance I'm talking about is

694
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 about the model, the parameter the theta, we talk about the f theta

695
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 okay so let's don't confuse yourself, we use the term

696
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 bias and variance sometimes for data, let's say I have a bunch of data I can calculate the variance

697
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 it's not the same, okay so here the bias is

698
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 the error that we learn from the training, means the theta we

699
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 get through the training, okay so this error is

700
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 caused by the wrong assumption you made during the training

701
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 or you made in the model you have, okay

702
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 so I'll give you one example, just now I mentioned that

703
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 if let's say I know my x and y are actually following the

704
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 second order, let's say polynomial, right I know that my y equal to

705
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 maybe x squared plus x plus some constant but I always

706
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 use a linear regression to fit them, so no matter how much you fit

707
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 there will always be some fundamental error due to the single assumption you have

708
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 and this will contribute to the bias part of

709
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 the model, okay so again bias is part of the

710
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 error you well get in the model and it's due to the fact that your model is too simple

711
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 okay now the second error, variance

712
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 is due to the fact that we always use the empirical

713
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 risk minimization, we do not know the actual distribution, so

714
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 sometimes when you have this few number of training data in practice

715
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 they could have some small fluctuations, okay

716
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 so due to the fact that you have some noise, could because when you sample the measures

717
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 you could have some very unlikely sample to generate it from

718
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 the training data, right so this small fluctuation could

719
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 drive your model to be wrong or to be deviate from the

720
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 optimal model, right so for example when I learn them

721
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 somehow my training label have some noise and then

722
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 when you fit the model to the training sample the model could fit to the noise rather than

723
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 the sample itself, right so these kind of

724
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 errors due to the sensitivity to some small fluctuation

725
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 in the training sample, this is called variance, okay

726
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 in other words for the same data distribution I could, let's say the first time

727
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 I sample 1000 samples over it but next time I randomly get another

728
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 1000, you will get different models that you learn, these difference

729
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 is the variance we're talking about, alright now

730
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 so until then, well contributed to the total

731
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 error we care about, means what the model you

732
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 get deviate from the true model and overall error we

733
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 care about is called the expected error, right so you

734
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 will hear the term later, so expected error

735
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 talking about the, for the future testing case, for

736
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 example a sample that is randomly drawn from the same distribution

737
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 what is the likelihood that we expect it to be misclassified

738
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 by the learned model, right this is the true error we care about

739
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 or the total error we will need to analyze, right we call it

740
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 expected error and in practice like how can we estimate

741
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 or measure the expected error because we don't know the distribution

742
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 right so the practical way to do it is by setting

743
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 another data set without the labels and see how the model

744
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 predicts for them, so in our subject or in most of the cases

745
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 we will use testing error or sometimes validation

746
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 error to measure the expected error, right so you

747
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 will see that in some questions, people use expected error and the

748
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 testing error interchangeably so don't be surprised because both of them represent

749
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 let's say I have unseen cases, right where I apply my model, how much

750
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 possibility that I will get it wrong, okay so this is

751
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 what we really care about, now haven't say that

752
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 if you plot let's say your expected

753
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 error as the function of the model you have, okay so here

754
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 the expected error again is the error that

755
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 I apply my model to a future data in a testing set

756
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 right how much likelihood I will get my sample wrong

757
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 right so basically the smaller the better, the larger the worse

758
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 the better, right that's the expected error I will have, now I can plot this curve

759
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 as a function of model complexity so what is this

760
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 model complexity means, it basically, I mean informally

761
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 means how flexible your model is, can it be like very free or

762
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 very limited, right so basically the larger the complexity

763
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 the more free your model is but you can think about the complexity

764
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 informally as how many free parameters in your

765
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 SVM or neural network, the amount of free

766
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 parameters is like more you will get higher model

767
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 complexity, right you can think about this informally as the amount of

768
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 free parameters you have, right so in other words I can plot

769
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 my expected error as a function of number of free

770
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 parameters, okay so for example if I have a neural network

771
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 right the complexity is usually referred to the

772
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 number of hidden neurons, means the more hidden neuron I have

773
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 the higher complexity I will have for my model, right so now you can actually

774
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 plot your expected error as a function of model

775
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 complexity, right to see what is the right complexity I should get

776
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 because we want to minimize this error, right now we see that

777
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 the expected error will have two major components

778
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 alright one is bias, one is variance, okay now

779
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 the bias as part of the error will

780
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 refer to the type of error that due to the wrong or inaccurate

781
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 assumption you made for your model choice

782
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 okay it's part of it but it's contributing to the entire error we have

783
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 and the bias term different from expected error

784
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 will be always decreased when your model

785
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 complexity increases, okay so this is very important

786
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 even though the total error will change, you know sometimes increase

787
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 sometimes decrease but the bias part of it

788
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 which is major portion of the error you will get will be

789
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 monotonically decreased as your model complexity increases

790
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 okay why, you know why this is true

791
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 because you know if you still remember the definition of bias

792
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 the bias is due to the wrong assumption you make in the model

793
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 in other words if your model is more free

794
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 you are not limiting your model to some specific set

795
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 in other words you let the model to be more free, right so the freer

796
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 the model is means that the chance you get the model assumed to

797
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 be wrong is lower, right you don't really have this strong assumption

798
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 on the model, okay so in other words you can think about this like the

799
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 smaller, sorry the more restrictive the model is the chance

800
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 that the bias increase is higher because you could limit yourself

801
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 from getting the really the underline model, right for example

802
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 if your model is second order somehow you limit your model to be linear function

803
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 you may miss the chance to find the right fit, right so to this

804
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 end we see that the bias term is always decreased

805
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 or actually monotonically decreased as we increase the model

806
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 complexity, alright so you can represent it using this

807
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 red curve here, okay and we see that the bias is high

808
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 when the model is too simple, right so for example here

809
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 these are the region that corresponding to very high bias, okay if you

810
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 have a really high bias that means your model is too simple, right you don't

811
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 have a free enough model to feed through the data set you have

812
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 okay, make sense so i pose a little bit if you have any

813
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 questions you can ask me, right because this is really important so make sure

814
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 you understand the following things first what we care about

815
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 when we say we want to analyze the model is good or bad what we really care about

816
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 is the expected error because you are going to use the model

817
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 some way for future data, right so the expected error here

818
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 is defined as the likelihood that you will get the answer wrong

819
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 when you apply the model to future data, right so this is what we care about

820
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 we want to have a model that minimize the expected error, right that's number one

821
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 and number two is that the total error will be contributed from two parts

822
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 one part is called bias, one part is called variance, okay

823
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 bias and variance are the two major components that form the total error

824
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 okay so these are two parts and we say that they are driven by different

825
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 source, right different kind of source of error, bias is driven by the wrong

826
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 assumption or too restrictive assumption you make on the model

827
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 for example your parameter is too few that's the wrong assumption

828
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 right your model must be linear that's the wrong assumption it's not flexible enough

829
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 now variance is due to the fact that your model is like

830
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 too free such that when you learn the model there could be

831
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 too sensitive to a small or some small fluctuation in the set

832
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 and this so-called small fluctuation could due to the fact that

833
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 there could be some noise, right there could be some noise in the sample you get

834
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 and fitting to the noise will cause the model to be wrong

835
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 okay so the two things bias and variance are the two major components

836
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 of the total error you care about and now we are saying that

837
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
 how these two contribute to the total error, right so we know that one of them

838
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 the bias term will be a function that is monotonically

839
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 decrease over the model complexity

840
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 which is highlighted in the red curve here

841
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 that's the bias, right the bias for sure is going to decrease

842
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 as the model complexity increase because

843
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 well normally the bias high scenario is here

844
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 referred to the fact that your model is too simple or too restrictive

845
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 alright so make sure you understand where the

846
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 phenomenon come from the phenomenon of monotonically

847
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 decrease of the bias is that the bias is reflecting how restrictive

848
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 your model is, how simple your model is, alright

849
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 okay good now the other part right remember

850
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 there are two parts the other part which is called the variance

851
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 now the variance is the opposite the variance will always increase

852
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 monotonically as the model complexity increases

853
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
 okay because like I mentioned the variance is due to the fact that

854
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
 there could be some wrong feeling to the

855
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 data that is caused by the small fluctuation

856
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 because you will only have a few number of samples from the distribution

857
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 and those samples could be corrupted with noise now when I'm

858
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 training my model I'm feeding to the limited measure you have and when I'm feeding them

859
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 I could feed to the sample themselves or I could accidentally feed to the noise

860
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
 so if your model is too flexible

861
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
 instead of feeding to the sample sometimes you are feeding running

862
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
 to the small fluctuation maybe caused by noise and that feeding

863
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
 will cause your model to be wrong or deviate from the

864
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 optimal model right and to that end the variance

865
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 will always become higher when the model is more free

866
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 or in other words you have higher model complexity so it's also a

867
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 monotonic function but this time is increased as the

868
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
 complexity increases okay

869
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
 so always variance increases with the model complexity

870
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
 right so together these two

871
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 if you sum the two up like the red line red curve

872
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
 plus the blue curve and of course there could be some other like

873
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
 small perturbation which is not a major fact together

874
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
 they can be used to formulate the expected error of your classifier

875
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
 so this summation is what we care about

876
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 we want to make sure this summation is minimized

877
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 okay so that's why

878
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
 if you are given any curve for example expected error here

879
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 you have to keep in mind that this curve is contributed by

880
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 bias plus variance and the bias and variance

881
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 behavior are exact opposite right one is increasing

882
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 one is decreasing and the summation of them is the

883
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 true error that we care about right is so-called expected error

884
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 and in practice the expected error will be always

885
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
 approximated by the testing error or validation error so if you see next time

886
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 I give you a plot where the vertical axis become testing error

887
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 and that's the price that just means expected error right

888
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
 or validation error it's the same because we can never know the true expectation

889
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 so we always use a unseen data set to approximate the

890
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 expected error right this is what we usually do in practice

891
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 okay it makes sense so far

892
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 any question so far so good

893
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 okay great now if you are given a table like this

894
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 you can put a plot like this and sometimes

895
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 I ask you say hey if I have a model with certain complexity

896
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 right can you determine whether this model I have

897
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
 is like too simple or too complex now how to make a

898
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
 judgment so the very first thing you do is first

899
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 trying to find the minimum point okay maybe I didn't draw this line right but

900
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 the very first thing you want to do is find a good tradeoff the good

901
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 tradeoff point which is exactly at the location

902
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
 which minimizes the total error okay remember what we care about is the

903
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 total error right so you need to find a line that is indicating the

904
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
 minimum of the total error and if your model

905
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
 is on the left hand side of the minimum error point

906
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
 okay that's something we call the simple model

907
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
 because you can further increase the model complexity to

908
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
 decrease your total error right so if you find a given model

909
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 which is at the left hand side of your minimum error point

910
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
 you call this a simple model and this simple model will have

911
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 like a high bias and low variance

912
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
 okay because here the red curve is still pretty high the blue

913
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
 curve is pretty low okay so the whatever region

914
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
 on the left hand side of this cutoff bar you will call it a simple model

915
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
 on the right hand side of it correspondingly we will have a

916
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
 complex model right which means this model suffers from very low bias

917
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 but relative high variance it's the opposite but

918
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
 both of them means your parameters is not optimized

919
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
 you can further make it better by either decreasing or increasing

920
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
 the number of parameters or the freedom or complexity of your model

921
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
 right and how to decide it is to first find this cutoff line

922
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
 and see which side is your model where is your model right on the left

923
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
 on the right you can make a decision whether you should increase or

924
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
 decrease the model complexity okay makes sense

925
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
 so make sure you know how to draw this line this line is nothing to do with

926
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
 this line will be the point which corresponding to

927
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
 the minimum expected error and also it's going to be the intersection

928
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
 of the two lines so either way they will always be the same okay make sure

929
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 you can find it and compare that point ways and in given model

930
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
 you have right and then you can make a decision

931
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
 alright now here is the illustration right

932
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 so we know that when you choose the model parameters

933
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
 you will have this tradeoff between bias and variance

934
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
 what you really want is to try to minimize the summation of the

935
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 two okay but what really happened

936
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
 is if you have let's say a complex model or simple model

937
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
 so I use this we call it a bow

938
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
 eye plot to visualize it so let me first explain what

939
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 I'm plotting here okay so all of these red dots

940
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
 or red cross here they are representing

941
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
 a specific model okay so you can consider all of this point

942
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
 like the cross here are referring to a specific model I have

943
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
 and this point will be determined by the parameter theta

944
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
 so let's say I have the same neural network but

945
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
 depends on the parameter I have the model will be different

946
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 so what I'm visualizing here is how the parameter is plotted in the space

947
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
 okay so imagine you have only two parameters right X and Y

948
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
 you can plot the parameters in the 2D space right this is what I'm plotting here

949
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
 so every red dots representing a specific model

950
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
 okay now the entire plane represents all the possible

951
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
 model you can have right all the possible model parameter space

952
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
 is this 2D space now we know that the true model

953
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
 in other words the best optimal model is the bow eye

954
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
 in the center right you want to make sure your model is close

955
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
 to the center as much as possible right but very likely you cannot

956
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
 get it so we're going to see what happened if your bias

957
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
 and variance varies okay so the first plot

958
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
 is the case where you have high bias and low

959
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
 variance okay so what is high bias and low variance

960
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
 it basically means here right simple model remember

961
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 if you have a simple model you have high bias and low variance now

962
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
 if your model is like too simple you have high bias and low variance

963
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
 what you will have let's say I learn the same model let's say

964
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
 you learn it multiple times or maybe here how much time we have

965
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
 eight times right you will get different models but all of them

966
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
 will be deviate from your bow eye in a similar way

967
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
 in other words there could be something shifted to one direction

968
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
 and this uniform shifting is called a bias

969
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
 because for example your limit to your model to be linear

970
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
 right so no matter how much you learn it it will always deviate from the second order

971
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
 polynomial right and high bias means no matter how

972
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
 many times you learn it they will be always shifted from the bow eye in a uniform way

973
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
 alright so this is how you visualize high bias and no variance

974
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 and now you can see where the term bias come from because you will have

975
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
 this consistent deviation from the model themselves

976
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
 to the optimal model right okay now

977
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
 the second case is that maybe I can try to

978
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
 even increase my variance right so

979
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
 if both my variance and bias are high I will have

980
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 a universal shift from my optimal model

981
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
 plus the model I learn themself will be very different from

982
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
 time to time remember every time when you sample differently

983
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
 you will get different noise right and those different noise could affect your model

984
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
 in a different way so high variance basically means

985
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
 if you learn the model let's say 10 times with different kind of sampling

986
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
 I will have all the learned model to be different from each other

987
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
 on top of a universal shift

988
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
 so this is what if you visualize the high variance case that's what

989
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
 you will have alright now another

990
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
 of course we want to have the best case which is low bias and low variance

991
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
 if you have low bias and no variance that means all of the sample will be concentrated very closely

992
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
 at the bow eye and themselves will be very similar

993
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
 so this is like low bias and low variance case now if you

994
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
 have a complex model means here that's the case

995
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
 where you have low bias but high variance now in this case

996
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
 all of this learned model even though they are concentrating

997
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
 very close to the center but due to the fact that they will be very

998
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
 easily affected by the noise themselves will be quite separate

999
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
 from each other so that means you will have certain

1000
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
 variance if you sample your training data differently

1001
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
 so these cover the four scenarios if you want to visualize them in this 2D plot

1002
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
 and hope they give you some idea like first where does the bias

1003
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
 and variance come from secondly if you want to visualize them

1004
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
 how do they look like in the 2D space

1005
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
 alright so think about it let's take a 15 minutes break

1006
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
 and come back with the following up content

1007
