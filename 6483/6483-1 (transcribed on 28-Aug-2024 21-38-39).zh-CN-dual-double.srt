1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,040
 Hello class, can you hear me alright psychedelic music?

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,040
同学们大家好，你们能听到我迷幻的音乐吗？

2
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:47,519
 Hello class. Can you hear me all right behind? Cannot hear me? Can you?

2
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:47,519
同学你好。你能听到我在后面说话吗？听不到我说话？你可以吗？

3
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:57,520
 Hello everyone. Welcome to this class. Okay, this is actually very first time we offer this course to postgraduate students.

3
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:57,520
大家好。欢迎来到这堂课。好吧，这实际上是我们第一次向研究生提供这门课程。

4
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:09,520
 It's really very well overwhelmed. Okay, so that's why this is the additional class we opened in the last minute.

4
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:09,520
真的是让人不知所措。好的，这就是为什么这是我们在最后一刻开设的附加课程。

5
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:19,520
 I'm glad you can all make it. Okay, so my name is Chen Li Hui and I'm your first lecturer for this course.

5
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:19,520
我很高兴你们都能做到。好的，我叫陈丽辉，是这门课程的第一位讲师。

6
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:29,520
 We have this teaching team here, three of us. So I'm teaching the first 13 hours followed by Prof Tan.

6
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:29,520
我们这里有一个教学团队，我们三个人。所以前 13 个小时是我教的，然后是 Tan 教授。

7
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:45,520
 So he's going to cover more on the numerical or neural network or the current numerical data driven based kind of AI or machine learning.

7
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:45,520
因此，他将更多地介绍数值或神经网络或当前基于数值数据驱动的人工智能或机器学习。

8
00:01:46,520 --> 00:02:02,520
 Then followed by Prof Wen. That is again, he's talking about the mix. He has both the symbolic base and also numerical base approach and also some training methods and so on.

8
00:01:46,520 --> 00:02:02,520
接下来是温教授。这又是他在谈论混合。他既有符号基础，也有数字基础方法，还有一些训练方法等等。

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:11,519
 Okay, so I'm the one to cover the more conventional approach. Okay, so that means symbolic AI.

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:11,519
好的，我来介绍更传统的方法。好的，这意味着符号人工智能。

10
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:30,519
 Okay, so my part is more about the symbolic AI. That means it's not totally data driven. Okay, that means you actually have to come up with abstraction, use the symbols to represent the things, not totally data based on data to drive, come up with a representation.

10
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:30,519
好的，我的部分更多是关于符号人工智能。这意味着它不完全是数据驱动的。好吧，这意味着你实际上必须提出抽象，使用符号来表示事物，而不是完全基于数据来驱动，提出表示。

11
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:41,520
 Okay, then from there you actually rely on certain skills or the search algorithms to find the solution. Okay, so that is my part.

11
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:41,520
好吧，然后从那里你实际上依靠某些技能或搜索算法来找到解决方案。好的，这就是我的部分。

12
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:51,520
 And also I'm going to cover the data mining, which again is more conventional approach rather than nowadays totally data driven kind of approach.

12
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:51,520
我还将介绍数据挖掘，这又是更传统的方法，而不是现在完全数据驱动的方法。

13
00:02:51,520 --> 00:03:08,520
 Okay, but as an introduction course, it's good to have both. Okay, so maybe in the future when you design your system, you can actually mix those together, make use of certain principles for the design of the new models and then for the data driven approach.

13
00:02:51,520 --> 00:03:08,520
好吧，但作为入门课程，两者兼而有之就好。好吧，也许将来当你设计系统时，你实际上可以将它们混合在一起，利用某些原则来设计新模型，然后使用数据驱动方法。

14
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:28,520
 Okay, okay, so here is our contact just in case you need to get in touch outside the class contact hour. And also we have two TA here. Oh, actually, yeah, yeah, at moment is two, we hopefully we have more. Okay, but at moment we only have two of them.

14
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:28,520
好的，好的，这是我们的联系方式，以防您需要在课堂联系时间之外联系。而且我们这里还有两个助教。哦，实际上，是的，是的，现在是两个，我们希望我们有更多。好的，但目前我们只有两个。

15
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:45,520
 And they are contacted here. Likely they will get involved. We will get them involved in later stage. One is a marking of the subsea. Another one is about hand on project. Okay, so we have one group project.

15
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:45,520
他们是在这里联系的。他们很可能会参与其中。后期我们会让他们参与进来。一是海底标记。另一个是关于手工项目。好的，我们有一个小组项目。

16
00:03:45,520 --> 00:04:05,520
 So we want you to form a group of three members to work on project. Actually, that is the difference between the undergrad group and the post grad group, mainly about this project. Okay, so your project would be slightly different.

16
00:03:45,520 --> 00:04:05,520
因此，我们希望您组成一个由三名成员组成的小组来开展项目。其实这就是本科组和研究生组的区别，主要是这个项目的区别。好的，所以你的项目会略有不同。

17
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:22,520
 The requirement would be different. So please form the teams with your peers. Okay, so with your same category students to form a group of three to work on the project. Okay, undergrad, they will be undergrad groups.

17
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:22,520
要求会有所不同。因此，请与您的同事一起组建团队。好的，那么与您的同类学生组成一个三人小组来完成该项目。好吧，本科生，他们将是本科生小组。

18
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:40,520
 Okay, so this group forming, we are going to share a Google Doc later. And then you can actually after you decide your groups, you can just fill in the name and also the group number. Okay, platform is prepared for that.

18
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:40,520
好的，这个小组成立了，我们稍后将分享一个 Google 文档。然后你实际上可以在决定你的组后，你可以只填写名称和组号。好的，平台已经为此做好了准备。

19
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:57,520
 And I think probably hopefully next week will be available. Okay, although the project issue won't start until probably week six. So it's no hurry, but it's good to have a form form a group as early as possible. So we can start to discuss things and work together. Okay.

19
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:57,520
我想也许下周就可以了。好的，尽管项目问题可能要到第六周才会开始。所以不着急，不过尽早形成组团形式还是有好处的。这样我们就可以开始讨论事情并一起工作。好的。

20
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:16,520
 Yeah, the TA later probably will help you to have some hands on or actually, we will schedule some sessions for you know, for your Q&A. But we haven't finalized this yet, because everything is, is very new is last minute kind of thing. Okay, so we will do it.

20
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:16,520
是的，稍后助教可能会帮助您进行一些实践，或者实际上，我们会为您安排一些会议，以便您进行问答。但我们还没有最终确定这一点，因为一切都是非常新的，都是最后一刻的事情。好的，我们就这么做。

21
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:45,520
 So we will do it. Hopefully next week, I need to discuss with profitable and trade he went for conference last week and they just came back. So we need to set settle everything. And then we will keep you informed. Okay. And this is our learning outcome. So you can see basically, we want to learn something about the state space representation. As I said, that is a more symbolic based approach. And then strategies for the search. And for the search,

21
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:45,520
所以我们会这么做。希望下周，我需要与他上周参加会议的盈利和贸易进行讨论，他们刚刚回来。所以我们需要安排好一切。然后我们会随时通知您。好的。这就是我们的学习成果。所以你基本上可以看到，我们想了解一些关于状态空间表示的知识。正如我所说，这是一种更具象征意义的方法。然后是搜索策略。而对于搜索来说，

22
00:05:46,520 --> 00:06:15,520
 there are two big category. One is exhaustive search. Okay, so is a systematically uninformed way to search through the space if we have enough space and also enough computational resources. Okay, so that is one type of search. Another one type of search is with hints. Okay, so that is a heresy based search. So we're going to cover this. And then also another topic, which is a special branch of the AI, which is doing the data mining.

22
00:05:46,520 --> 00:06:15,520
有两大类。一是穷举搜索。好吧，如果我们有足够的空间和足够的计算资源，那么这就是一种系统性的无信息搜索方式。好的，这是一种搜索。另一种类型的搜索是带有提示的。好吧，这是一个基于异端的搜索。所以我们将介绍这一点。然后还有另一个主题，这是人工智能的一个特殊分支，它正在进行数据挖掘。

23
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:43,520
 So we want to take out the pattern from a mountain of data. Okay, use association mining. So that is some four topics here. I'm going to cover. Although I only put one line here as you know, objective to learn the machine learning models and algorithms. But this one actually come cover several weeks on that. Okay, so profit times part and problems part mainly about that part. And then lastly, we also touch about, you know, the possible application.

23
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:43,520
所以我们想从海量的数据中找出模式。好的，使用关联挖掘。这就是这里的四个主题。我要掩护。虽然我在这里只写了一行，如你所知，目的是学习机器学习模型和算法。但这篇文章实际上已经报道了几周了。好的，利润倍数部分和问题部分主要是关于这部分的。最后，我们还谈到了可能的应用。

24
00:06:46,520 --> 00:07:14,520
 Okay, so this is the hopefully we as an introduction, we are, we are exposed to these topics, and hopefully we can understand these things. And some of you may continue your research developments in this area. Okay, so this is what we hoping. And yeah, so no single book can cover this right. So those references and also our lecture slides and homework is already in the description.

24
00:06:46,520 --> 00:07:14,520
好的，这就是希望我们作为介绍，我们接触到这些主题，希望我们能够理解这些事情。你们中的一些人可能会继续在这一领域进行研究开发。好吧，这就是我们所希望的。是的，所以没有一本书可以涵盖这一点。因此，这些参考资料以及我们的讲座幻灯片和作业已经在描述中。

25
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:43,520
 We uploaded to our course website for post grad. Yeah, so you just looking to the 24 s one, the EE for six, six, four, eight, three. Okay, for undergrad, they are IE for for for for H3. Okay, so and also, I believe some of the post grad actually we're sitting with undergrad tomorrow, right, tomorrow morning, but it's a very small group of people.

25
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:43,520
我们上传到我们的研究生课程网站。是的，所以你只需要寻找 24 的 1，EE 的 6、6、4、8、3。好吧，对于本科生来说，他们是 IE for for for for H3。好吧，所以，我相信一些研究生实际上明天我们会和本科生坐在一起，对，明天早上，但这是一小群人。

26
00:07:43,520 --> 00:08:06,520
 But our recorded lecture will be uploaded to the EE six, four, H3 only for post grad. And then undergrad will be in IE. Okay, it's the same. Actually, it's the same contents and the same teaching team. So it's just a different timing. Okay, so different timing. So one this this is a new class additional class.

26
00:07:43,520 --> 00:08:06,520
但我们录制的讲座将上传到 EE 六、四、H3，仅供研究生使用。然后本科生就会去IE。好吧，是一样的。其实都是一样的内容，一样的教学团队。所以这只是时间不同而已。好吧，时间不同。这是一门新的附加课程。

27
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:29,520
 Okay, copyright for the materials. So this is really strict for your own use only. Okay, NTU properties or cannot distribute it. Please aware that. Okay, so that's why actually our notes is so called so called. Yeah, it's password protected, right. So you need to put the password to open it. Okay.

27
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:29,520
好的，材料的版权。所以这对于您自己使用来说非常严格。好吧，南洋理工大学的财产或无法分发它。请注意这一点。好吧，这就是为什么我们的笔记实际上是这样称呼的。是的，它受密码保护，对吧。所以你需要输入密码才能打开它。好的。

28
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:58,520
 Okay. Okay. Yeah, about the schedule and assessment. So you can see the green one. Yeah, so that is your class. Okay, so this is a newly added this class today from today. Okay, so Thursday, and then the another group is for undergrad, which is tomorrow morning. For assessments, okay, basically 40% on the continuous assessment. Okay, so what are the 40%?

28
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:58,520
好的。好的。是的，关于日程安排和评估。这样你就可以看到绿色的了。是的，这就是你的班级。好的，所以这是从今天开始新添加的这个课程。好的，周四，然后另一组是本科生，明天早上。对于评估来说，好吧，基本上是持续评估的 40%。好的，那 40% 是多少？

29
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:21,520
 Two homework assignments, one quiz. Okay, so homework assignment only 5% each. So two of it. And then you have a quiz. So for my part, mainly about the quiz, okay, 10%. I'm going to give you some exercise, but that so called exercise or home is homework is not going to be assessed.

29
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:21,520
两份家庭作业，一份测验。好吧，家庭作业每份只占 5%。那么两个。然后你有一个测验。所以就我而言，主要是关于测验，好吧，10%。我会给你一些练习，但是所谓的练习或家庭作业不会被评估。

30
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:50,520
 Okay, so just purely for your exercise only, okay, practice only. So that one, I will upload it like tomorrow. I mean, this weekend, I will upload so we can work on something. And we are going to upload the answer as well. So it's purely for your practice. So for my part, basically just a practice and then attend the quiz. Okay, but for procton and problem parts, we have the homework each okay for each of them.

30
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:50,520
好吧，纯粹是为了你的练习，好吧，只是练习。所以那个，我会像明天一样上传。我的意思是，这个周末我会上传，以便我们可以做一些事情。我们也将上传答案。所以这纯粹是为了你的练习。所以就我而言，基本上只是练习，然后参加测验。好的，但是对于质子和有问题的部分，我们每个人都有合适的作业。

31
00:09:51,520 --> 00:10:16,520
 That's a homework. And they also combine everything together by two mainly they are part for the project, okay for the project. And that is a group project for 20%. Take 20% for that group effort. Okay, so we are going to release project requirements later. Okay, so we're still revising it and then try to finalize everything.

31
00:09:51,520 --> 00:10:16,520
那是一份家庭作业。他们还将所有东西结合在一起，主要是他们是项目的一部分，对项目来说还好。这是 20% 的小组项目。为该小组的努力抽出 20%。好的，我们稍后会发布项目需求。好的，所以我们仍在修改它，然后尝试完成所有事情。

32
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:38,520
 And suppose is applied those machine learning methods. So it's definitely from week five later, okay, because procton will come in in the second in the last two hours in week five. Okay, so my 13 hour cover all the four, four weeks plus one hour in the week five. Okay.

32
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:38,520
并假设应用了那些机器学习方法。所以肯定是从第五周以后开始，好吧，因为 Proton 将在第五周最后两个小时的第二个时间出现。好吧，我的 13 小时涵盖了所有四个星期，四个星期加上第五周的一小时。好的。

33
00:10:39,520 --> 00:11:06,520
 And then the final exam 60%. So you see, this is a strict, strict restricted open. Okay, so basically you can bring piece of a four sheets. Okay, you can write as many things on top of as you can write as much as possible. Okay, double sided and can print in whatever size you can have tiny, tiny, tiny size. That's okay.

33
00:10:39,520 --> 00:11:06,520
然后期末考试60%。所以你看，这是一个严格的、严格的限制开放。好的，基本上你可以带四张纸中的一块。好吧，你可以在上面写尽可能多的东西。好的，双面，可以打印任何尺寸，你可以有很小，很小，很小的尺寸。没关系。

34
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:21,520
 Okay, so you can have everything on that so called cheat sheets, right? Yeah, so we can have that bring in. And then, of course, we are not going to set some question which easily can copy from your sheets, right? Okay.

34
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:21,520
好的，所以你可以在所谓的备忘单上找到所有内容，对吗？是的，所以我们可以将其引入。然后，当然，我们不会提出一些可以轻松从您的表格中复制的问题，对吧？好的。

35
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:43,520
 So, so this is restricted open for the final exam. Okay, two hours only. Okay, two hours, two hours, two hours. So actually, basically, this course, post grad is very similar requirement as undergrad. But we do have a slightly more challenging for you for on the project side. Okay, so that 20%.

35
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:43,520
所以，所以这是限制期末考试开放的。好吧，只有两个小时。好吧，两个小时，两个小时，两个小时。所以实际上，基本上，研究生这门课程的要求与本科生非常相似。但在项目方面，我们确实给您带来了稍微更大的挑战。好的，那就是 20%。

36
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:54,520
 Okay, so that is arrangements so far. Any questions? Do you have any quick questions? I can answer. Yes.

36
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:54,520
好了，目前为止的安排就这些了。有疑问吗？您有什么问题吗？我可以回答。是的。

37
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:14,520
 Different class meaning? Tomorrow only post grad. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Yes, same category. Because post grad, the requirement will be different from the undergrad. Okay, so if you have friend having a class tomorrow, but they are post grad. Yes, no problem. Okay.

37
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:14,520
不同类别的含义？明天才毕业。是啊，是啊，是啊，当然。是的，同一类别。因为研究生的要求会与本科生不同。好的，如果你有朋友明天要上课，但他们是研究生。是的，没问题。好的。

38
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:39,520
 Yes. And also likely we have to rely on your own computer to do the project. Okay, we are not able to provide the GPU, maybe only GPU. But, you know, the computation resources, probably not. Okay, yeah, be prepared. But not very challenging. I mean, toy problem, not very big, huge data or whatever. Okay.

38
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:39,520
是的。而且我们很可能必须依靠您自己的计算机来完成该项目。好吧，我们无法提供 GPU，也许只能提供 GPU。但是，你知道，计算资源可能不是。好吧，是的，做好准备。但不是很有挑战性。我的意思是，玩具问题，不是很大，海量数据或其他什么。好的。

39
00:12:39,520 --> 00:13:01,520
 Okay. And we probably can have some shared accounts in the MLT, but but that one depends on depends CC whether it's really someone needed. And then we will see. Okay. So so so we probably have some dedicate some time for the TA to help. If you have a quick question. Yes.

39
00:12:39,520 --> 00:13:01,520
好的。我们可能可以在 MLT 中拥有一些共享帐户，但这取决于 CC 是否真的有人需要。然后我们就会看到。好的。所以我们可能会花一些时间让助教帮忙。如果您有一个简单的问题。是的。

40
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,520
 Yes.

40
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,520
是的。

41
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:11,520
 Well, why you take this?

41
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:11,520
嗯，你为什么要拿这个？

42
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:21,520
 Okay, I don't know. You can try the first week you can drop. If you find you cannot really follow. Okay.

42
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:21,520
好吧，我不知道。你可以在可以放弃的第一周尝试一下。如果你发现你无法真正跟上。好的。

43
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:31,520
 You. It's not compulsory. This is free. Okay. Yes. Anything else?

43
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:31,520
你。这不是强制性的。这是免费的。好的。是的。还要别的吗？

44
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:53,520
 Yeah.

44
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:53,520
是的。

45
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:16,520
 Okay.

45
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:16,520
好的。

46
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:45,520
 So as I said, I'll give you some extra exercise, but for purely for practice, no marking, no assessment. Okay. So my part, actually, I probably give you twice. I give you one, which is about representation learning one about search. Okay. So for your practice only, and then come back for the quiz. So the quiz, this is a tentative schedule. Okay. Likely is in the end of the week five. That means a Saturday. Okay. But this need to be confirmed by the school because we need to be confirmed by the school. Okay.

46
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:45,520
正如我所说，我会给你一些额外的练习，但纯粹是为了练习，没有评分，没有评估。好的。所以我的部分，实际上，我可能会给你两次。我给你一个关于表示学习的关于搜索的一个。好的。所以仅供您练习，然后回来参加测验。所以测验，这是一个暂定的时间表。好的。可能是在第五周结束时。这意味着星期六。好的。但这需要得到学校的确认，因为我们需要得到学校的确认。好的。

47
00:14:46,520 --> 00:15:06,520
 So this is a big venue. We need a computer and this will be on the ISIS system. Okay. So we need the main power to do it in regulation. So I haven't got confirmation yet. Okay. But just book your calendar. Okay. So likely is that Saturday. If it's not that Saturday will be the week after. But try to book this. Okay.

47
00:14:46,520 --> 00:15:06,520
所以这是一个很大的场地。我们需要一台计算机，这将位于 ISIS 系统上。好的。所以我们需要主要力量在监管上来做这件事。所以我还没有得到确认。好的。但只需预订您的日历即可。好的。那个星期六很可能是。如果不是，周六将是下周。但尝试预订这个。好的。

48
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:35,520
 Okay. Look, this, I try to push for this one. Okay. And then after that, then, yeah, basically profit time take over this, this, oh, yes. And two of them were swapped. Okay. So profit time cover two hours and then follow problem will come back to talk about unsupervised learning. And then because profit time need to go for overseas trip. So so so so that's why these two weeks they were swapped.

48
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:35,520
好的。看，这个，我努力推动这个。好的。然后在那之后，然后，是的，基本上利润时间接管了这个，这个，哦，是的。并且其中两个被交换了。好的。所以利润时间覆盖两个小时然后后面的问题会回来讲无监督学习。然后因为盈利时间需要去海外旅行。如此如此，这就是为什么这两周他们交换了。

49
00:15:35,520 --> 00:16:05,520
 So week 10 week six swap. And now that that's profit time come back, continue everything. And then until the week 10 then perform takeover. Okay. So this is arrangement. And then for the homework, homework one likely is this. Okay. So again, this is up to them to to when to release a question and the required for the deadline. Okay. So this is just for reference. Likely week one. Sorry. Homework one homework two. And then the project day one. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay

49
00:15:35,520 --> 00:16:05,520
所以第十周第六周交换。现在利润时间回来了，继续一切。然后直到第10周再执行接管。好的。所以这就是安排。然后是作业，作业可能是这样的。好的。同样，这取决于他们何时发布问题以及截止日期的要求。好的。所以这仅供参考。可能是第一周。对不起。作业一作业二。然后是项目第一天。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的。所以这仅供参考。好的

50
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:29,260
 Time when And you'll get yet I haven't checked. I think is early December. Okay. Okay. Any question. So this is a schedule 드�وبиик

50
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:29,260
什么时候你会得到我还没有检查过。我认为是十二月初。好的。好的。有任何问题。所以这是一个时间表

51
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,460
 So this is a schedule.

51
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,460
所以这是一个时间表。

52
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,240
 Topic-wise is tentative, I mean from week five later.

52
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,240
主题方面是暂定的，我的意思是从第五周后开始。

53
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,180
 I think it's about there, but they can change.

53
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,180
我认为事情就在那里，但他们可以改变。

54
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,380
 Depends on some special arrangements.

54
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,380
取决于一些特殊安排。

55
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,220
 Okay.

55
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,220
好的。

56
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,300
 Okay, then come back to my part.

56
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,300
好吧，那么回到我的部分。

57
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,280
 So I'm your first lecture.

57
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,280
所以我是你的第一堂课。

58
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,980
 I'm going to cover symbolic AI basically,

58
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,980
我将基本上介绍符号人工智能，

59
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,500
 together with data mining.

59
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,500
与数据挖掘一起。

60
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,220
 Okay, so this is what we are going to cover

60
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,220
好的，这就是我们要介绍的内容

61
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,380
 for this part one.

61
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,380
对于这第一部分。

62
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,860
 So we have part one, part two, and part three.

62
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,860
所以我们有第一部分、第二部分和第三部分。

63
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,380
 So my part one, four topics.

63
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,380
所以我的第一部分有四个主题。

64
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,500
 Okay, so today we talk about introduction

64
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,500
好啦，今天我们就来说说介绍

65
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,460
 and very, very, very brief history.

65
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,460
以及非常非常非常简短的历史。

66
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,860
 And then I need to move on to the second topic,

66
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,860
然后我需要继续第二个话题

67
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,500
 which is talking about representation.

67
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,500
这是在谈论代表性。

68
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,020
 Okay, symbolic representation.

68
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,020
好吧，符号表示。

69
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,020
 And also show you what is the key technique

69
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,020
并且还告诉你什么是关键技术

70
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:27,139
 or the procedures for symbolic base, symbolic AI.

70
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:27,139
或符号基础、符号人工智能的程序。

71
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,180
 Okay, so basically you need to do the abstraction,

71
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,180
好的，基本上你需要进行抽象，

72
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,620
 come out with the symbols, representation.

72
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,620
拿出符号、表示。

73
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,100
 Then you have to have a search rules

73
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,100
那么你必须有一个搜索规则

74
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,460
 to say what are the legal movements.

74
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,460
说什么是合法的动作。

75
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,340
 Okay, then thirdly, how to manipulate it.

75
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,340
好吧，那么第三，如何操纵它。

76
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,660
 Okay, so this is a thing.

76
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,660
好吧，所以这是一件事。

77
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,220
 So I need to cover this today.

77
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,220
所以我今天需要介绍这个。

78
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,540
 Data structure, the most common use one,

78
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,540
数据结构，最常用的一种，

79
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,700
 is a graph, a tree, a special graph.

79
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,700
是一个图，一棵树，一个特殊的图。

80
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,860
 And then the strategy.

80
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,860
然后是策略。

81
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,820
 So we don't talk about specific one,

81
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,820
所以具体的我们就不谈了

82
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,380
 but the overall strategies for search

82
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,380
但搜索的总体策略

83
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,900
 is either data-driven or goal-driven.

83
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,900
要么是数据驱动的，要么是目标驱动的。

84
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,140
 Okay, data-driven, that means forward.

84
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,140
好吧，数据驱动，这意味着前进。

85
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,500
 And goal-driven, backwards.

85
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,500
并以目标为导向，倒退。

86
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,860
 Okay, so that is overall strategy.

86
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,860
好的，这就是总体策略。

87
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,780
 And then next week onwards,

87
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,780
然后从下周开始，

88
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,180
 we can talk about the specific search algorithm.

88
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,180
我们可以谈谈具体的搜索算法。

89
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,300
 Okay, so we need to cover quite a lot today.

89
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,300
好的，今天我们需要讲很多内容。

90
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,260
 Okay, let's see the time.

90
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,260
好吧，我们看看时间。

91
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,620
 Okay, I think, okay.

91
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,620
好吧，我想，好吧。

92
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,100
 So that is the first file.

92
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,100
这就是第一个文件。

93
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:38,899
 And this is my lecture one.

93
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:38,899
这是我的第一堂课。

94
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,900
 Okay, so you can see, yeah, four topics, how we arrange.

94
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,900
好的，所以你可以看到，是的，四个主题，我们是如何安排的。

95
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,700
 Okay, so this is, I try to follow the schedule.

95
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,700
好的，就是这样，我尽量遵守时间表。

96
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,620
 Okay, again, my introduction.

96
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,620
好吧，我的介绍又来了。

97
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,940
 Yeah, actually I'm from computer background,

97
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,940
是的，其实我是计算机出身的，

98
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,460
 computer science, and also I did my PhD in neural network.

98
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,460
计算机科学，我还获得了神经网络博士学位。

99
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,620
 Okay, that was long, long ago.

99
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,620
好吧，那是很久很久以前的事了。

100
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,980
 I joined NTU 30 years ago.

100
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,980
我30年前加入南洋理工大学。

101
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,060
 Okay, I joined NTU 30 years ago.

101
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,060
好吧，我三十年前就加入了南洋理工大学。

102
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,780
 I joined NTU 30 years ago.

102
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,780
我30年前加入南洋理工大学。

103
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,220
 Okay, I was the first one teach neural network in school,

103
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,220
好吧，我是第一个在学校教神经网络的人，

104
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,300
 in the school.

104
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,300
在学校里。

105
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,820
 And guess how many student we have?

105
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,820
猜猜我们有多少学生？

106
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,820
 At that time,

106
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,820
当时，

107
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,060
 10, yes.

107
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,060
10，是的。

108
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,060
 Yeah, 10 to 15, okay, for undergrad.

108
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,060
是的，10到15，好吧，对于本科生来说。

109
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:34,580
 But those are really, really, really keen learner.

109
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:34,580
但他们都是非常、非常、非常热衷于学习的人。

110
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,260
 Okay, so actually it's very fun to teach with them.

110
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,260
好吧，实际上和他们一起教学非常有趣。

111
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,260
 Very small class, and very, we go through derivation together,

111
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,260
很小的班级，而且非常，我们一起推导，

112
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,740
 and many of them actually work in this area after that.

112
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,740
之后他们中的许多人实际上在这个领域工作。

113
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,699
 Okay, but that was long, long ago.

113
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,699
好吧，但那是很久很久以前的事了。

114
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:49,139
 And then the class become bigger, bigger.

114
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:49,139
然后班级变得越来越大。

115
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:50,980
 Actually later I introduced the data mining,

115
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:50,980
其实后来我介绍了数据挖掘，

116
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,860
 but data mining become more popular.

116
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,860
但数据挖掘变得越来越流行。

117
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,699
 And then later then we adapt into the deep learning,

117
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,699
然后我们适应深度学习，

118
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,020
 and then we have the CNN, we have the other methods.

118
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,020
然后我们有 CNN，还有其他方法。

119
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,300
 So that's how the course evolved.

119
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,300
这就是课程的演变过程。

120
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,660
 Okay, so yes, we starting from about 10 students,

120
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,660
好的，是的，我们从大约 10 名学生开始，

121
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,379
 and now look at the class.

121
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,379
现在看看班级。

122
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:13,100
 And this is for post-grader class,

122
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:13,100
这是针对研究生课程的，

123
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,100
 and then undergrad we also about 260, 270 students.

123
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,100
然后本科我们还有大约260、270名学生。

124
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,139
 Okay, so yes, become very big,

124
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,139
好吧，是的，变得很大，

125
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:26,139
 and I'm all the time actually was in computer science school

125
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:26,139
我实际上一直在计算机科学学校

126
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,220
 from my undergrad, and then I moved to Scotland

126
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,220
从我本科毕业，然后我搬到了苏格兰

127
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
 for my post-grad.

127
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
对于我的研究生。

128
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,540
 But when I joined NTU, it's the first time

128
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,540
但当我加入南洋理工大学时，这是第一次

129
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,060
 I come to a school of triple E,

129
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,060
我来到一所三E学校，

130
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,100
 because at that time they even don't have

130
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,100
因为那时他们甚至没有

131
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,780
 a school of computer science.

131
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,780
计算机科学学院。

132
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,220
 Actually NTU only have a division of material

132
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,220
其实NTU只有一个Material的部门

133
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,940
 and computing or something.

133
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,940
和计算什么的。

134
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,780
 Yeah, so but actually our school

134
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,780
是的，但是实际上我们学校

135
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,260
 have information engineering,

135
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,260
拥有信息工程，

136
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,620
 so it's more related to computer courses.

136
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,620
所以它与计算机课程的关系更大。

137
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,180
 That's why I'm teaching like software engineering,

137
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,180
这就是为什么我要教授软件工程，

138
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,540
 database, and AI and data mining,

138
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,540
数据库、人工智能和数据挖掘，

139
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,700
 and the introduction to data science and AI,

139
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,700
以及数据科学和人工智能的介绍，

140
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,580
 those computing related courses.

140
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,580
那些与计算机相关的课程。

141
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,659
 But I don't really know much about the signal processing,

141
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,659
但我对信号处理不太了解，

142
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,659
 and also signal systems, yeah, no, no,

142
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,659
还有信号系统，是的，不，不，

143
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:19,740
 hardware, no, no, no, not me.

143
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:19,740
硬件，不，不，不，不是我。

144
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,139
 Okay, yeah, so very, very lucky, very fortunate

144
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,139
好的，是的，非常非常幸运，非常幸运

145
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:24,500
 actually I'm teaching this course,

145
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:24,500
实际上我正在教授这门课程

146
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,139
 and this is also my research area,

146
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,139
这也是我的研究领域，

147
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,659
 and very closely related, so it's really fun

147
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,659
而且关系非常密切，所以真的很有趣

148
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,060
 to have this course keep updating the knowledge

148
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,060
让这门课程不断更新知识

149
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,580
 in this area and also doing the research in this area.

149
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,580
并在这方面进行研究。

150
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,820
 Okay, so this is a very quick introduction about myself.

150
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,820
好的，这是关于我自己的非常简短的介绍。

151
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,180
 Okay, so what we are going to cover today

151
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,180
好的，那么我们今天要讲的内容

152
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,980
 in the first lecture, so you see the outline,

152
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,980
在第一讲中，所以你看到了大纲，

153
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,420
 okay, just look at this slide.

153
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,420
好的，看看这张幻灯片。

154
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,420
 Firstly, ask yourself, what is AI?

154
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,420
首先，问问自己，什么是人工智能？

155
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,660
 Okay, what is AI?

155
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,660
好吧，什么是人工智能？

156
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,180
 Okay, ask yourself, what is AI?

156
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,180
好吧，问问你自己，什么是人工智能？

157
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,740
 The AI, this term becomes so popular, so what is it?

157
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,740
AI，这个词现在这么流行，那么它到底是什么？

158
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,820
 What is it?

158
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,820
它是什么？

159
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,620
 We can, yeah, probably the entire course,

159
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,620
我们可以，是的，可能整个课程，

160
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,580
 we try to answer this question, what is AI?

160
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,580
我们尝试回答这个问题，什么是人工智能？

161
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,900
 And also, what is the most popular algorithms,

161
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,900
还有，最流行的算法是什么，

162
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,940
 and what is AI try to address, or try to do?

162
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,940
人工智能试图解决什么问题，或者试图做什么？

163
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,540
 And then why, why we want to do it?

163
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,540
那我们为什么要这么做呢？

164
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,180
 Okay, yeah, I'm sure you have many answers

164
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,180
好吧，是的，我相信你有很多答案

165
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,540
 why you want to do it.

165
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,540
为什么你想这样做。

166
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,220
 Like, many of you are using chat GBT, are you?

166
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,220
就像，你们很多人都在使用 GBT 聊天工具，是吗？

167
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,580
 Yeah, try to get answers for various questions

167
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,580
是的，尝试获得各种问题的答案

168
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,980
 you have in mind, yeah, it's very good.

168
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,980
你心里有数，是的，这很好。

169
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,659
 You know, you can use this as a tool to help us to learn.

169
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,659
你知道，你可以用它作为帮助我们学习的工具。

170
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:45,300
 So that is a way to enhance our understanding

170
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:45,300
所以这是增强我们理解的一种方法

171
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,820
 or our learning, right?

171
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,820
或者我们的学习，对吗？

172
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,020
 And also, yeah, so we want to ask why.

172
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,020
而且，是的，所以我们想问为什么。

173
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,220
 And then also, is there any very specific

173
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,220
还有，有没有什么非常具体的

174
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,380
 common objective for AI?

174
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,380
人工智能的共同目标？

175
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,100
 Or is there, don't have a universal kind of way

175
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,100
或者是否存在，没有通用的方式

176
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,660
 to define it?

176
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,660
来定义它？

177
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,660
 It depends on the application, depends on the perspective.

177
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,660
这取决于应用程序，取决于视角。

178
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,220
 And then very, very brief history of the AI,

178
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,220
然后是非常非常简短的人工智能历史，

179
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,180
 and then some major applications.

179
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,180
然后是一些主要的应用。

180
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,020
 Okay, then those are the key terms,

180
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,020
好的，那么这些是关键术语，

181
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,540
 so hopefully we'll be more familiar with these terms later.

181
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,540
所以希望我们稍后能更熟悉这些术语。

182
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,980
 You probably ask yourself why we talk about gameplay?

182
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,980
您可能会问自己为什么我们谈论游戏玩法？

183
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,180
 Why gameplay is, play game, why the game design

183
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,180
为什么是游戏玩法、玩游戏、为什么是游戏设计

184
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,980
 is related to AI?

184
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,980
和AI有关吗？

185
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,740
 And why theory prove is related to the AI?

185
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,740
为什么理论证明与人工智能有关？

186
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,940
 Why?

186
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,940
为什么？

187
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,940
 But now we all talk about language and standing is AI, right?

187
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,940
但现在我们都在谈论语言，而站立就是AI，对吗？

188
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,899
 But you see which one is much more challenging

188
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,899
但你看看哪一个更具挑战性

189
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:47,420
 for computer to do it.

189
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:47,420
让计算机来做这件事。

190
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,540
 That's why we start from easy one,

190
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,540
这就是为什么我们从简单的开始，

191
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,980
 start from something which is symbolic AI can handle.

191
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,980
从人工智能可以处理的象征性事物开始。

192
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,340
 That means we can come out with the abstraction,

192
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,340
这意味着我们可以得出抽象，

193
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,100
 to describe, use a symbol to describe things,

193
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,100
描述，用符号来描述事物，

194
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,899
 and then we rely on the logic to do the reasoning, inference.

194
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,899
然后我们依靠逻辑来进行推理、推论。

195
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:09,379
 So that is how we started.

195
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:09,379
我们就是这样开始的。

196
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:13,340
 And then now move on to the much more sophisticated way.

196
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:13,340
然后现在转向更复杂的方法。

197
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,899
 We move on to data driven, totally data driven.

197
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,899
我们转向数据驱动，完全数据驱动。

198
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:18,100
 We don't know how to represent it.

198
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:18,100
我们不知道如何表示它。

199
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,980
 Let machine learn to represent it.

199
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,980
让机器学习来表示它。

200
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,419
 Okay, so this is a very big move.

200
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,419
好吧，这是一个非常大的举动。

201
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,500
 So what is AI?

201
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,500
那么什么是人工智能呢？

202
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,939
 What is AI?

202
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,939
什么是人工智能？

203
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:38,060
 Probably a very general definition is try to say,

203
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:38,060
可能一个非常笼统的定义是尝试说，

204
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,060
 is human attempt, or our attempt to build models of ourself.

204
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,060
是人类的尝试，或者说我们尝试建立自己的模型。

205
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,899
 We want to build a model of ourself.

205
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,899
我们想建立一个我们自己的模型。

206
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,340
 Ourself can do what?

206
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,340
我们自己能做什么呢？

207
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,260
 Can do thinking, reading, speaking,

207
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,260
可以思考、阅读、口语、

208
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,300
 make decision, adaptation, right?

208
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,300
做出决定，适应，对吗？

209
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,820
 Many things have strategies,

209
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,820
很多事情都是有策略的，

210
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,220
 huge knowledge from somewhere, we can learn very fast.

210
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,220
来自某个地方的巨大知识，我们可以学得很快。

211
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,020
 Those things, yeah, we are building model, try to do that.

211
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,020
是的，我们正在构建模型，尝试这样做。

212
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,100
 Okay, but what about those movies?

212
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,100
好吧，但是那些电影呢？

213
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,620
 The early things, yeah, those are the science fictions.

213
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,620
早期的事情，是的，那些都是科幻小说。

214
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,179
 That is not really the robot can really do that.

214
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,179
那并不是机器人真的能做到这一点。

215
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,459
 That is a simulation, right?

215
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,459
那是模拟吧？

216
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:31,459
 Like the Terminator actually was the one,

216
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:31,459
就像终结者实际上就是那个一样，

217
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,379
 like imagine human body actually can combine

217
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,379
就像想象人体实际上可以结合

218
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:42,139
 with other material, and then become,

218
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:42,139
与其他材料，然后成为，

219
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:45,300
 the human become, or robot become more powerful, right?

219
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:45,300
人类变得更强大，或者机器人变得更强大，对吧？

220
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,419
 And can do some tasks.

220
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,419
并且可以做一些任务。

221
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:49,820
 Actually, we are moving to that direction,

221
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:49,820
事实上，我们正朝着这个方向前进，

222
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,460
 but it's still a fiction.

222
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,460
但这仍然是虚构的。

223
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,300
 And then we move on to something which is actually human,

223
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,300
然后我们继续讨论实际上是人类的东西，

224
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,980
 no, the robot actually can have emotion.

224
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,980
不，机器人实际上可以有情感。

225
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,980
 Okay, so it's also one step closer to mimic human, right?

225
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,980
好吧，那么这也离模仿人类又近了一步，对吧？

226
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,820
 Yeah, and those are the emotion,

226
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,820
是的，这些就是情感，

227
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,379
 and can have dream as well.

227
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,379
也可以有梦想。

228
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:13,540
 I don't know how many of you already watched those movies?

228
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:13,540
不知道大家有多少人看过这些电影呢？

229
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,139
 Probably two old, one of those movie are two old.

229
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,139
可能是两部老电影，其中一部是两部老电影。

230
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,300
 Okay, so based on Professor Elin Rich,

230
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,300
好的，根据艾琳·里奇教授的说法，

231
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:27,379
 actually she's a professor, I think is the first author

231
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:27,379
实际上她是一位教授，我认为是第一作者

232
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,700
 wrote, I mean, first textbook in AI was wrote by her.

232
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,700
写道，我的意思是，第一本人工智能教科书是她写的。

233
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:38,540
 So that's why I want to get the definition from her.

233
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:38,540
所以这就是为什么我想从她那里得到定义。

234
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,899
 It's a very general, but it's true,

234
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,899
虽然很笼统，但是确实如此

235
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,100
 our attempt to build models of ourselves.

235
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,100
我们尝试建立自己的模型。

236
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,620
 Okay, so that is AI, and then this is from a Google,

236
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,620
好吧，这就是人工智能，然后这是来自谷歌的，

237
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,500
 Jiminy, Jimini, you see, that is how they define,

237
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,500
吉米尼，吉米尼，你看，这就是他们的定义，

238
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,340
 they say AI is a field of computer science,

238
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,340
他们说人工智能是计算机科学的一个领域，

239
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,300
 workers are creating intelligent machine

239
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,300
工人们正在创造智能机器

240
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,300
 that can mimic human cognitive functions.

240
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,300
可以模仿人类的认知功能。

241
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,020
 Okay, so this is, you can also use ask chat GBT,

241
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,020
好的，就是这样，你也可以使用ask chat GBT，

242
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,659
 what's AI, see how they answer, how they define it.

242
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,659
什么是人工智能，看看他们如何回答，如何定义它。

243
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,780
 Okay, so basically, what we've tried to do is,

243
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,780
好的，基本上，我们尝试做的是，

244
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,780
 we try to build something, model or machine or robot.

244
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,780
我们尝试建造一些东西，模型、机器或机器人。

245
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,899
 They can do something which at moments,

245
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,899
他们有时可以做一些事情，

246
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,139
 probably human can do better.

246
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,139
也许人类可以做得更好。

247
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:27,100
 Most likely human can do better,

247
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:27,100
人类很可能可以做得更好，

248
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,180
 but we want to build something which can either compatible

248
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,180
但我们想要构建一些可以兼容的东西

249
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,940
 with us or certain task that can exceed us.

249
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,940
与我们一起或某些可能超出我们范围的任务。

250
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,860
 Okay, so for some tasks, for example,

250
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,860
好的，对于某些任务，例如，

251
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,540
 they probably can run very fast,

251
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,540
他们可能跑得很快，

252
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,700
 which is a speed beyond human, right?

252
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,700
这是超越人类的速度吧？

253
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,780
 Or they can actually handle many, many tasks concurrently

253
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,780
或者他们实际上可以同时处理很多很多任务

254
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,420
 and so on, okay, so that is something probably

254
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,420
等等，好吧，这可能是

255
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,100
 can do better than us, but many other cognitive ability,

255
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,100
可以比我们做得更好，但是很多其他的认知能力，

256
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:00,100
 hopefully they can kind of reach or compatible with us.

256
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:00,100
希望他们能够与我们达到或兼容。

257
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,140
 Okay, so yeah, today homework, okay,

257
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,140
好吧，今天的作业，好吧，

258
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,860
 go back, watch those YouTube, they try to talk more,

258
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,860
回去看看那些 YouTube，他们试图多说一些，

259
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,540
 that is a very professional way to talk about,

259
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,540
这是一种非常专业的谈论方式，

260
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:15,860
 try to define what is AI, okay.

260
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:15,860
试着定义一下什么是人工智能，好吧。

261
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,340
 Here a few key points is,

261
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,340
这里有几个关键点，

262
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,820
 it's study and design intelligent agents

262
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,820
它研究和设计智能代理

263
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,899
 and agent actually able to interact with the real world

263
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,899
代理实际上能够与现实世界交互

264
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,820
 and also reasoning, planning and also learning adaptation.

264
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,820
还有推理、计划和学习适应。

265
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,500
 And maybe we should add more, like even decision making.

265
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,500
也许我们应该添加更多内容，比如决策。

266
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,100
 Yeah, they actually can, like those have to make decision,

266
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,100
是的，他们实际上可以，就像那些必须做出决定的人一样，

267
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,060
 they can, especially some game, those actually,

267
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,060
他们可以，尤其是一些游戏，实际上，

268
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,060
 Dota 2, for example, they have to play

268
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,060
以 Dota 2 为例，他们必须玩

269
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,300
 with five members play together,

269
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,300
五个成员一起玩，

270
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,340
 so they have a collaboration,

270
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,340
所以他们有合作，

271
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,340
 so it's already kind of beyond that, okay.

271
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,340
所以它已经超出了这个范围，好吧。

272
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,700
 So other definitions, yeah, again from Professor Alienrich

272
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,700
所以其他定义，是的，再次来自 Alienrich 教授

273
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,500
 and Calvin Knight, that is their textbook,

273
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,500
和卡尔文·奈特，那是他们的教科书，

274
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,140
 yeah, they try to say AI is a study of how to make computer

274
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,140
是的，他们试图说人工智能是一门关于如何制造计算机的研究

275
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,500
 do things at which a moment people are better, okay,

275
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,500
做一些让人们变得更好的事情，好吧，

276
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,060
 we are better, now we try to make a computer

276
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,060
我们变得更好了，现在我们尝试制造一台计算机

277
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,780
 can do things which at moments we are better,

277
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,780
可以做一些我们在某些时刻做得更好的事情，

278
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,380
 so hopefully they can, as I said,

278
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,380
所以希望他们能够，正如我所说，

279
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,380
 make the machine compatible or even better, okay.

279
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,380
让机器兼容甚至更好，好吧。

280
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,740
 And the Strahd Russell and Peter Novik,

280
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,740
还有斯特拉德·拉塞尔和彼得·诺维克，

281
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,940
 actually these two professors,

281
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,940
其实这两位教授，

282
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,780
 they are another conventional AI textbook written by them,

282
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,780
他们是他们写的另一本传统人工智能教科书，

283
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,060
 okay, also more symbolic before, okay,

283
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,060
好吧，之前也比较象征性，好吧，

284
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,140
 but of course the textbook also evolved.

284
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,140
当然，教科书也在不断发展。

285
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,140
 So as I said, AI has to do with smart programs,

285
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,140
正如我所说，人工智能与智能程序有关，

286
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,940
 so let's get on writing, so that was very old way, right,

286
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,940
那么让我们继续写作吧，这是非常古老的方式，对吧，

287
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,420
 they actually rely on writing the program to do it,

287
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,420
他们实际上依靠编写程序来做到这一点，

288
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,980
 but now it's not really,

288
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,980
但现在事实并非如此

289
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,700
 now it's a lot to do with data driven, right,

289
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,700
现在这与数据驱动有很大关系，对吧，

290
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,500
 but we need to have a good model

290
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,500
但我们需要有一个好的模型

291
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,660
 that any data can fit in, okay,

291
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,660
任何数据都可以放入，好吧，

292
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,340
 but that was beginning, yeah, we define actually,

292
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,340
但这才开始，是的，我们实际上定义了，

293
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,420
 believe the AI is very much still in the hands

293
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,420
相信人工智能仍然掌握在手中

294
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,440
 of the programmer or designer, okay,

294
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,440
程序员或设计师的，好吧，

295
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,140
 so the designer is the one decide the life

295
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,140
所以设计师才是决定生活的人

296
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,300
 or decide how capable your machine can be,

296
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,300
或决定您的机器的能力，

297
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,060
 so that's why they rely on the code.

297
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,060
这就是他们依赖代码的原因。

298
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,900
 Okay, then the latest one,

298
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,900
好吧，那么最新的，

299
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,060
 Extra Taylor, actually he's the CEO of the X company,

299
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,060
额外的泰勒，其实他是X公司的CEO，

300
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,659
 so he said the AI is attempt to make computer

300
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,659
所以他说人工智能是试图制造计算机

301
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:41,500
 do what they do in movies, okay,

301
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:41,500
做他们在电影里做的事，好吧

302
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,419
 in the movies was animation, assimilation,

302
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,419
电影里有动画、同化、

303
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,179
 but now it's a real thing,

303
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,179
但现在这已经成为现实了

304
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,560
 you build the real thing can really talk,

304
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,560
你建造的真实的东西可以真正说话，

305
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,560
 really, really robot can really talk like a human,

305
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,560
真的真的机器人真的可以像人类一样说话

306
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,280
 right, can walk around and can do some performance

306
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,280
可以，可以走动，可以做一些表演

307
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,940
 or cook dinner for us, you know,

307
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,940
或者为我们做饭，你知道，

308
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,820
 that is no longer assimilation, it's not a fantasy,

308
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,820
那不再是同化，这不再是幻想，

309
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,659
 it's a real thing, they build a machine can do that,

309
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,659
这是真的，他们建造了一台机器可以做到这一点，

310
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:10,659
 okay, so that is, and yeah, so like in a movie

310
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:10,659
好吧，就是这样，是的，就像电影里一样

311
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,460
 what they have, they have a dream and they have conscious,

311
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,460
他们拥有什么，他们有梦想，他们有意识，

312
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,020
 you know, they have emotion, they can learn,

312
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,020
你知道，他们有情感，他们可以学习，

313
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,860
 they can do dream force learning

313
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,860
他们可以进行梦想力量学习

314
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,060
 and they can integrate the bio-metrical,

314
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,060
他们可以整合生物识别，

315
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,179
 you know, those things into material,

315
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,179
你知道，那些东西转化为物质，

316
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,220
 into the human body, okay,

316
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,220
进入人体后，

317
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,980
 that is something what we aim to do now,

317
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,980
这就是我们现在要做的事情，

318
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,140
 and why, okay, so we know, okay, why is AI,

318
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,140
为什么，好吧，所以我们知道，好吧，为什么人工智能，

319
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,020
 AI is about building a machine to do things

319
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,020
人工智能是关于建造一台机器来做事

320
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,500
 human can do better at moments, okay,

320
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,500
人类有时可以做得更好，好吧，

321
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,780
 then why we want to do that?

321
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,780
那我们为什么要这么做呢？

322
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,140
 Firstly, we probably don't know how we learn, right,

322
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,140
首先，我们可能不知道我们如何学习，对吧，

323
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,760
 but can we build something which is better than us?

323
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,760
但我们能建造出比我们更好的东西吗？

324
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,140
 Still possible, right, it's like we know birds can fly

324
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,140
还是有可能的，对吧，就像我们知道鸟会飞一样

325
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,980
 and we probably don't know exactly the birds,

325
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,980
我们可能并不完全了解鸟类，

326
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,380
 the how they fly, the how they actually fly,

326
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,380
他们如何飞行，他们实际上如何飞行，

327
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,500
 but we can build airplane, can fly, okay,

327
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,500
但我们可以造飞机，可以飞，好吧，

328
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,900
 so we are having a working principle there

328
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,900
所以我们有一个工作原理

329
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,480
 and we are not rebuild another birds,

329
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,480
我们不会重建另一种鸟，

330
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,580
 but as long as we can achieve the similar functionality

330
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,580
但只要我们能实现类似的功能

331
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,600
 as a bird, okay, so this is possible, right,

331
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,600
作为一只鸟，好吧，所以这是可能的，对吧，

332
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,300
 so that's why actually we are talking about,

332
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,300
所以这就是为什么我们实际上正在谈论

333
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,740
 although we don't really completely know

333
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,740
虽然我们并不完全知道

334
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,419
 how human learns and how we do things,

334
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,419
人类如何学习以及我们如何做事，

335
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:38,419
 but we can still try to see how to achieve the level,

335
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:38,419
但我们还是可以尝试看看如何达到这个水平，

336
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,100
 like what we did for the language understanding,

336
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,100
就像我们为语言理解所做的那样，

337
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,100
 totally data-driven, okay, and the algorithm is very simple

337
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,100
完全数据驱动，好吧，算法也很简单

338
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,980
 and then totally algorithm, data-driven,

338
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,980
然后完全由算法、数据驱动，

339
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,659
 use a simple algorithm, actually we build something

339
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,659
使用一个简单的算法，实际上我们构建了一些东西

340
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,660
 which is so powerful, looks like very human, right,

340
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,660
太强大了，看起来很人性化，对吧，

341
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,940
 looks like they really understand,

341
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,940
看来他们真的懂了

342
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,540
 although not sure, not sure they really understand or not,

342
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,540
虽然不确定，不确定他们是否真正理解，

343
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,020
 but looks like they understand it, okay,

343
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,020
但看起来他们明白了，好吧，

344
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,140
 so you see two things, one is actually,

344
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,140
所以你看到两件事，一是实际上，

345
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,380
 even we don't know, but we can use this computer power

345
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,380
即使我们不知道，但我们可以使用这种计算机能力

346
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,460
 or algorithms or methods or build models

346
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,460
或算法或方法或构建模型

347
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,620
 actually to enhance our thinking, okay,

347
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,620
实际上是为了增强我们的思维，好吧，

348
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,860
 there another point is to understand how we think,

348
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,860
还有一点是了解我们如何思考，

349
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,139
 because with that help, even we don't know in advance

349
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,139
因为有了这种帮助，我们事先也不知道

350
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:28,580
 how we know, how we think, how we do,

350
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:28,580
我们如何知道，我们如何思考，我们如何做，

351
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,300
 but we use a simple model to simulate it

351
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,300
但我们用一个简单的模型来模拟它

352
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,379
 and then we try to refine the process

352
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,379
然后我们尝试完善流程

353
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:38,899
 and then probably the outcome,

353
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:38,899
然后可能的结果是

354
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:41,620
 it will be very close to what we expected

354
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:41,620
它将非常接近我们的预期

355
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,620
 and then we can, you know, we can revise it

355
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,620
然后我们可以，你知道，我们可以修改它

356
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,620
 and reinforce it, so that is a procedure, okay,

356
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,620
并强化它，所以这是一个程序，好吧，

357
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:55,939
 so that's why we do need to know,

357
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:55,939
所以这就是为什么我们需要知道

358
00:33:55,939 --> 00:33:58,580
 we don't need to know everything to start,

358
00:33:55,939 --> 00:33:58,580
我们不需要知道一切才能开始，

359
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,739
 we can start from somewhere

359
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,739
我们可以从某个地方开始

360
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:04,100
 and then we try to enhance our understanding

360
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:04,100
然后我们尝试增强我们的理解

361
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,480
 and also try to help us to understand, okay,

361
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,480
并尝试帮助我们理解，好吧，

362
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,940
 so this is by Herbert Simon,

362
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,940
这是赫伯特·西蒙的作品，

363
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,100
 actually this is considered as one of the funding father

363
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,100
实际上这被认为是资助父亲之一

364
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:20,100
 of AI, although he got no better price in economics, okay,

364
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:20,100
人工智能，虽然他在经济学上没有得到更好的价格，好吧，

365
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,460
 but he really made a lot contribution in various ways,

365
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,460
但他确实在各个方面做出了很多贡献，

366
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,259
 so he was the one actually tried to understand

366
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,259
所以他才是真正试图理解的人

367
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:31,219
 how decision making, human understanding, you know,

367
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:31,219
决策、人类理解如何，你知道，

368
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,900
 he tried to make contribution in that,

368
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,900
他试图在这方面做出贡献，

369
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,020
 that's why it's more theoretically,

369
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,020
这就是为什么它更理论上，

370
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,739
 he made a lot of contribution to AI, okay,

370
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,739
他对AI做出了很多贡献，好吧，

371
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:42,339
 so like what he predicted, you see, in 1965,

371
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:42,339
正如他在 1965 年所预测的那样，

372
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,020
 he already said machines will be capable

372
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,020
他已经说过机器将有能力

373
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,420
 of doing any work a man can,

373
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,420
做任何一个人能做的工作，

374
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,780
 yeah, it's going to be like that, right, machine, machine,

374
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,780
是的，它会像那样，对，机器，机器，

375
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,980
 yeah, so yeah, definitely it's a fusion of technology,

375
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,980
是的，所以是的，这绝对是技术的融合，

376
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,340
 all kinds of things fusion together,

376
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,340
各种事物融合在一起，

377
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,100
 so this is called, the AI actually is considered

377
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,100
所以这个叫，AI其实就是认为

378
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,980
 as an industry revolution, that's why you are all here,

378
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,980
作为一场行业革命，这就是你们都在这里的原因，

379
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,820
 you are interested to know more and don't miss out,

379
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,820
有兴趣了解更多的朋友不要错过哦

380
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,700
 okay, so next, so we know what is, and then we know why,

380
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,700
好的，接下来，我们知道是什么，然后我们知道为什么，

381
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,700
 and then next is objectives, okay,

381
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,700
接下来是目标，好吧，

382
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,180
 so we will say, actually don't necessarily have

382
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,180
所以我们会说，实际上不一定有

383
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,180
 a very fixed set of universal agree upon the objectives,

383
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,180
一套非常固定的普遍同意的目标，

384
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,740
 but we can look at from different perspective,

384
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,740
但我们可以从不同的角度来看，

385
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,260
 and then you can design the AI in that direction, okay,

385
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,260
然后你可以朝那个方向设计人工智能，好吧，

386
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,260
 so look at the horizontally,

386
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,260
所以从横向看，

387
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,580
 you want the, one side is very human,

387
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,580
你想要的，一方面很人性化，

388
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,700
 that means very emotional driven,

388
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,700
这意味着非常情绪化，

389
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:48,140
 probably not as logic or not as rational as a machine,

389
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:48,140
可能不像机器那样逻辑或理性，

390
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,980
 for example, right, so that direction is a human,

390
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,980
例如，对，所以那个方向是一个人，

391
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,220
 horizontally another direction is about rational,

391
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,220
横向的另一个方向是关于理性的，

392
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,740
 and then vertically is about thinking or is about acting,

392
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,740
然后纵向是关于思考或者是关于行动，

393
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,860
 okay, so we can partition this into these four areas,

393
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,860
好的，我们可以将其分为这四个区域，

394
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,500
 and then you can see, for example,

394
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,500
然后你可以看到，例如，

395
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,700
 you want the machine to can think very humanly,

395
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,700
你希望机器能够非常人性化地思考，

396
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,260
 and then thinking wise, very thinking like a human,

396
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,260
然后明智地思考，非常像人类一样思考，

397
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,100
 then you need to have a lot emotion,

397
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,100
那么你需要有很多的情感，

398
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,460
 you wanna design a machine, have emotion,

398
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,460
你想设计一台机器，有情感，

399
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,460
 have these attachments or have this recognize

399
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,460
有这些附件或有此识别

400
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,660
 the facial expression, and also more like a human,

400
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,660
面部表情也更像人类，

401
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,660
 but if it's more like rational,

401
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,660
但如果它更像是理性的

402
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,580
 then it's more rule related,

402
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,580
然后它更多与规则相关，

403
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,580
 so actually, you have the rule reasoning,

403
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,580
所以实际上，你有规则推理，

404
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,620
 and then you can have this like the rule before,

404
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,620
然后你就可以像之前的规则一样，

405
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,580
 long, long ago, yeah, which is more like a chess play,

405
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,580
很久很久以前，是的，这更像是一场国际象棋比赛，

406
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,779
 which is more based on the rule based,

406
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,779
这更多的是基于规则，

407
00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:50,500
 okay, symbolic related, yeah, so yeah,

407
00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:50,500
好吧，象征性的相关，是的，所以是的，

408
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,500
 so this, if acting wise, action wise,

408
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,500
所以，如果明智地行动，明智地行动，

409
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,259
 yeah, you want to be acting like a human,

409
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,259
是的，你想表现得像一个人，

410
00:36:57,259 --> 00:37:01,700
 then you can like what we had, chat GBT now, right,

410
00:36:57,259 --> 00:37:01,700
那你就可以喜欢我们的东西了，现在就聊GBT吧，

411
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:06,859
 have this way to talk, and like us, right,

411
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:06,859
有这样的说话方式，就像我们一样，对吧，

412
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,460
 and also can pass a tooling test,

412
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,460
并且还可以通过模具测试，

413
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,540
 so what is tooling test?

413
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,540
那么什么是工装测试呢？

414
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,220
 Tooling test means the person ask questions,

414
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,220
工具测试意味着人们提出问题，

415
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:21,020
 so behind the scene have machine, computer, program,

415
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:21,020
所以幕后有机器、计算机、程序，

416
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,779
 another is a real person, okay,

416
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,779
另一个是一个真实的人，好吧，

417
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:24,339
 but I ask the same question,

417
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:24,339
但我问同样的问题

418
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:26,859
 then these people give me answer,

418
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:26,859
然后这些人给我答案，

419
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:29,339
 then if I cannot tell who is machine,

419
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:29,339
那么如果我分不清谁是机器，

420
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,820
 who is a real person,

420
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,820
谁是一个真实的人，

421
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:35,020
 that means the program pass a tooling test, right,

421
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:35,020
这意味着该程序通过了工具测试，对吧，

422
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,740
 yeah, so I think nowadays,

422
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,740
是的，所以我想现在，

423
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,780
 do you think the chat GBT can pass tooling test?

423
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,780
你认为聊天GBT能通过工具测试吗？

424
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,780
 Yeah, I think most of the time,

424
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,780
是的，我想大多数时候，

425
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,140
 they can answer very well,

425
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,140
他们都能很好地回答，

426
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,140
 you can't tell this is from,

426
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,140
你看不出这是来自

427
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,860
 if you don't look at it,

427
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,860
如果你不看的话

428
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,580
 you probably cannot tell,

428
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,580
你可能无法分辨，

429
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,780
 is from machine, or actually is from a real person,

429
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,780
来自机器，或者实际上来自真人，

430
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,980
 real expert give you answer, right,

430
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,980
真正的专家给你答案吧，

431
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,500
 so that's why they talk about,

431
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,500
所以这就是为什么他们谈论

432
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,460
 we need to revise,

432
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,460
我们需要修改，

433
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,100
 they say the tooling test is already out of date,

433
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,100
他们说工具测试已经过时了，

434
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,060
 so we need to redefine it, okay,

434
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,060
所以我们需要重新定义它，好吧，

435
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,300
 we probably need to define it in a way,

435
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,300
我们可能需要以某种方式定义它，

436
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,460
 yeah, I have one slide,

436
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,460
是的，我有一张幻灯片，

437
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,460
 talk about the, give them $100,000, US dollars,

437
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,460
谈论这个，给他们 10 万美元，

438
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,540
 and then go do the investment,

438
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,540
然后去做投资，

439
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,340
 and then see whether you can make money,

439
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,340
然后看看能不能赚钱

440
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,140
 if you can, then you pass a tooling test,

440
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,140
如果可以的话，那么你就通过了工具测试，

441
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,260
 so you want to test the overall ability,

441
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,260
所以你想测试一下综合能力，

442
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,380
 knowledge, and how to apply those knowledge,

442
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,380
知识，以及如何应用这些知识，

443
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,860
 in the real action,

443
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,860
在实际行动中，

444
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,740
 so it's no longer just answer questions,

444
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,740
所以它不再只是回答问题，

445
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,700
 not just like a test your knowledge,

445
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,700
不仅仅是测试你的知识，

446
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,940
 which is can be described it,

446
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,940
这是可以描述的，

447
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,140
 and then can be pre-trained it, right,

447
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,140
然后就可以预训练了，对吧，

448
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,580
 you cannot, not like that,

448
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,580
你不能，不能那样，

449
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,020
 more uncertainty involve,

449
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,020
更多的不确定性涉及，

450
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,060
 more decision making involve,

450
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,060
更多的决策涉及，

451
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,460
 much more challenging,

451
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,460
更具挑战性，

452
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,420
 so that they are talking about that,

452
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,420
所以他们正在谈论这个

453
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,020
 and also, I don't know,

453
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,020
而且，我不知道，

454
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,900
 they say they are going to write a book on that,

454
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,900
他们说他们要写一本关于这个的书

455
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,180
 but not sure whether it's published or not,

455
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,180
但不知道是否出版了

456
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,060
 okay, yeah, human intelligence,

456
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,060
好吧，人类的智慧，

457
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,500
 and artificial intelligence,

457
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,500
和人工智能，

458
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,100
 okay, so just like I said,

458
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,100
好吧，就像我说的，

459
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,140
 yeah, so birds,

459
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,140
是的，所以鸟，

460
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,419
 actually we build the airplane,

460
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,419
实际上我们制造飞机，

461
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:09,060
 but may not be,

461
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:09,060
但可能不是，

462
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,060
 it's not really reproduction of the birds,

462
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,060
这并不是鸟类的真正繁殖，

463
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,259
 so we just use the working principle,

463
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,259
所以我们只是利用工作原理，

464
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:18,500
 and then human vision and computer vision,

464
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:18,500
然后是人类视觉和计算机视觉，

465
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,940
 this can be different,

465
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,940
这可以是不同的，

466
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,740
 we don't really understand how exactly

466
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,740
我们真的不明白到底是怎么回事

467
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,220
 human eye processing information,

467
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,220
人眼处理信息，

468
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:28,939
 our neural network model can do that,

468
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:28,939
我们的神经网络模型可以做到这一点，

469
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:31,819
 and looks like they can process the model,

469
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:31,819
看起来他们可以处理模型，

470
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:34,180
 they can identify faces, for example,

470
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:34,180
他们可以识别面孔，例如，

471
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,540
 they can actually create even fake face, right,

471
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,540
他们实际上甚至可以创造假脸，对吧，

472
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,740
 it's construct something,

472
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,740
它正在构建一些东西，

473
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,100
 yeah, and then human brain,

473
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,100
是的，然后是人脑，

474
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,620
 and artificial neural network,

474
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,620
和人工神经网络，

475
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,939
 yeah, artificial neural network

475
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,939
是的，人工神经网络

476
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:47,700
 is definitely try to mimic our brain,

476
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:47,700
绝对是尝试模仿我们的大脑，

477
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,020
 from structure wise,

477
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,020
从结构上来说，

478
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,580
 they try to build a small,

478
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,580
他们试图建造一个小型的、

479
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,620
 very, very simple processor,

479
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,620
非常非常简单的处理器，

480
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,540
 which is like a mimic ourselves in the brain,

480
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,540
这就像我们大脑中的模仿者，

481
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,460
 and then they believe each cell connect to many massively,

481
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,460
然后他们相信每个细胞都与许多细胞大规模连接，

482
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,380
 connect to many, many others,

482
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,380
连接到许多许多其他人，

483
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,819
 and then we have a lot of such kind of simple cells,

483
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,819
然后我们有很多这样的简单细胞，

484
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,380
 and then when they combine together,

484
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,380
然后当它们结合在一起时

485
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,980
 they have this huge computational ability, right,

485
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,980
他们有如此巨大的计算能力，对吧，

486
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,819
 so this is the deep neural network built on top of that,

486
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,819
这是建立在其之上的深度神经网络，

487
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:17,380
 yeah, and then we see the power of it, right,

487
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:17,380
是的，然后我们看到了它的力量，对吧，

488
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,180
 so this is artificial,

488
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,180
所以这是人为的，

489
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,420
 artificial neural, artificial brain, right,

489
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,420
人工神经，人工大脑，对，

490
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,780
 our human brain may not be like that,

490
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,780
我们人类的大脑可能不是这样的

491
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,980
 actually, we know from very beginning, 1943,

491
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,980
事实上，我们从一开始就知道，1943年，

492
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,660
 when the two gentlemen built this simple model,

492
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,660
当两位先生建造这个简单的模型时

493
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,020
 neural network model,

493
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,020
神经网络模型，

494
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,260
 it was, they was really, really,

494
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,260
是，他们真的，真的，

495
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,620
 very, very oversimplified model, okay,

495
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,620
非常非常过于简化的模型，好吧，

496
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,620
 so each neuron only have a very simple processing ability,

496
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,620
所以每个神经元只有非常简单的处理能力，

497
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,020
 and then can only receive the input,

497
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,020
然后只能接收输入，

498
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,940
 and then have a go to certain function,

498
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,940
然后执行某个函数，

499
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,460
 and then pass on to the next, okay,

499
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,460
然后传给下一个，好吧

500
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,940
 and then have some weight,

500
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,940
然后有一些重量，

501
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,140
 that is everything we have inside the whole neural network,

501
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,140
这就是我们在整个神经网络中所拥有的一切，

502
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,420
 right, at moments,

502
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,420
对，在某些时刻，

503
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,020
 I mean, for each single cell is like that,

503
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,020
我的意思是，对于每个细胞都是这样的，

504
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,940
 but many neuroscientists,

504
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,940
但许多神经科学家

505
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,260
 they believe actually our neuron inside the brain

505
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,260
他们相信我们的神经元实际上位于大脑内部

506
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,420
 will be much more complicated,

506
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,420
将会变得更加复杂，

507
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,660
 we are using an oversimplified thing,

507
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,660
我们正在使用一个过于简单化的东西，

508
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,260
 but you see what we can achieve now, okay,

508
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,260
但你知道我们现在能取得什么成果，好吧，

509
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,780
 so human brain, the artificial neural network,

509
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,780
所以人脑，人工神经网络，

510
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,820
 probably still a big gap there,

510
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,820
可能还有很大的差距

511
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,820
 that's why I should have a group of people

511
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,820
这就是为什么我应该有一群人

512
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,660
 study the brain, cybernetics,

512
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,660
研究大脑、控制论、

513
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,020
 they actually really say they should get more funding,

513
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,020
他们实际上确实说他们应该获得更多资金，

514
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,380
 they are criticized too much funding

514
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,380
他们被批评资助太多

515
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,420
 give to the deep neural network approach, okay,

515
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,420
给深度神经网络方法，好吧，

516
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,900
 it's true, there are a lot of money was put in that side,

516
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,900
确实，那边投入了很多钱，

517
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,300
 but for fundamental study,

517
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,300
但对于基础研究来说，

518
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,620
 they are talking about the model probably is wrong,

518
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,620
他们谈论的模型可能是错误的，

519
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,980
 the model is over too simple,

519
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,980
模型太简单了，

520
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,860
 and so they are talking about we should get more funding

520
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,860
所以他们说我们应该获得更多资金

521
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,380
 in the fundamental study of the neurons,

521
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,380
在神经元的基础研究中，

522
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,380
 each one and build up,

522
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,380
每一个并建立起来，

523
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,700
 anyway, okay, so this is still ongoing things,

523
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,700
无论如何，好吧，所以这仍然是持续的事情，

524
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,540
 very, very quick briefing,

524
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,540
非常非常快速的简报，

525
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,940
 yeah, we just talk about this,

525
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,940
是的，我们只是谈论这个，

526
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,260
 is talking about these two gentlemen,

526
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,260
正在谈论这两位先生，

527
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,140
 McCluck and Pitz,

527
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,140
麦克拉克和皮茨，

528
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,819
 they are, one is a neuro,

528
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,819
他们是，一个是神经元，

529
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:15,580
 who is the neuroscientist,

529
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:15,580
神经科学家是谁

530
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,580
 and one is, yeah, he's a logician, I think,

530
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,580
一个是，是的，我认为他是一位逻辑学家，

531
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,660
 so they work together,

531
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,660
所以他们一起工作，

532
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,660
 they come out with a very simple cells,

532
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,660
他们拿出了非常简单的细胞，

533
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,259
 and then propose a model, okay,

533
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,259
然后提出一个模型，好吧，

534
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:26,819
 and then come out with this gentleman,

534
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:26,819
然后和这位先生一起出来，

535
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:27,819
 he's an engineer,

535
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:27,819
他是一名工程师，

536
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:32,220
 so he actually build up the hardware systems to do it,

536
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:32,220
所以他实际上建立了硬件系统来做到这一点，

537
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,460
 and then have this perceptual,

537
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,460
然后有这样的感性，

538
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,700
 and then finally they have the,

538
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,700
然后最后他们有了，

539
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,980
 these two gentlemen actually criticize such simple systems,

539
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,980
这两位先生实际上批评了这样简单的系统，

540
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,660
 they know you cannot do even things like exclusive wall,

540
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,660
他们知道你甚至不能做像专属墙这样的事情，

541
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,540
 okay, so that means your single layer perceptron

541
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,540
好的，这意味着你的单层感知器

542
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,140
 is not powerful enough,

542
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,140
不够强大，

543
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,100
 you cannot do all the functional transmissions,

543
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,100
你无法完成所有的功能传输，

544
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,140
 yeah, so that's why later,

544
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,140
是的，所以后来

545
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,779
 so this is a time, actually, AI have a winter time,

545
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,779
所以这是一个时间，实际上，AI有一个冬天的时间，

546
00:42:58,779 --> 00:42:59,939
 okay, very cool,

546
00:42:58,779 --> 00:42:59,939
好的，非常酷，

547
00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:02,740
 because this time was very, very hot,

547
00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:02,740
因为这个时候非常非常热

548
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,620
 and then, but by these two gentleman's paper,

548
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,620
然后，通过这两位先生的论文，

549
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,380
 they talk about, hey, you can't even do exclusive,

549
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,380
他们谈论，嘿，你甚至不能做独家，

550
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,180
 this kind of simple logic, okay,

550
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,180
这种简单的逻辑，好吧

551
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,500
 so that's why from here,

551
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,500
所以这就是为什么从这里开始

552
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,100
 these more than 10 years,

552
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,100
这10多年来，

553
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,740
 the AI was very quiet,

553
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,740
AI非常安静，

554
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,299
 so still go back to probably symbolic AI time,

554
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,299
所以还是回到可能象征性的人工智能时代，

555
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:25,060
 okay, numerical AI was kind of cool down,

555
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:25,060
好吧，数值人工智能有点冷静了，

556
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,900
 and then come back when they actually finally invented

556
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,900
然后当他们真正发明时才回来

557
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,420
 the multi-layer perceptron, okay,

557
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,420
多层感知器，好吧，

558
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,460
 with back propagation, the BP,

558
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,460
通过反向传播，BP，

559
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,020
 so yeah, you see, Professor Hinton is here,

559
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,020
所以是的，你看，Hinton 教授在这里，

560
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,340
 he's one of it, yeah, I was reading this,

560
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,340
他是其中之一，是的，我正在读这篇文章，

561
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:46,340
 when I doing PhD at that time was late 80s and early 90s,

561
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:46,340
我当时读博士的时候是80年代末90年代初，

562
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,820
 yeah, so their book, like a two Bible to me,

562
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,820
是的，所以他们的书对我来说就像一本两本圣经，

563
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,300
 one is blue color, one is brown color,

563
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,300
一种是蓝色，一种是棕色，

564
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,580
 yeah, volume one, volume two, okay,

564
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,580
是的，第一卷，第二卷，好吧，

565
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,060
 so each one have the, including BP algorithm one chapter,

565
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,060
所以每一篇都有，包括BP算法一章，

566
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,380
 it's very hard to read, I remember, okay,

566
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,380
很难读，我记得，好吧，

567
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,620
 anyway, so that is their book,

567
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,620
无论如何，那是他们的书，

568
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,540
 was like our Bible to study, yeah,

568
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,540
就像我们要学习的圣经一样，是的，

569
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,660
 and then SVM, and then finally deep neural network, right,

569
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,660
然后是 SVM，最后是深度神经网络，对吧，

570
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,300
 so again, Professor Hinton was one of it,

570
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,300
辛顿教授又是其中之一，

571
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,380
 so that's why he was considered

571
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,380
所以这就是为什么他被认为

572
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,740
 one of the father of AI as well, yeah,

572
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,740
也是人工智能之父之一，是的，

573
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,780
 so this is come to the deep neural network,

573
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,780
这就是深度神经网络，

574
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,740
 and this slide actually is not complete at all, at all,

574
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,740
这张幻灯片实际上根本不完整，

575
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,220
 okay, so it's purely, I highlight something

575
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,220
好吧，这纯粹是，我强调一些东西

576
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,419
 which is more related to the NLP progress,

576
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,419
这与NLP的进展更相关，

577
00:44:33,419 --> 00:44:35,859
 especially, although we have to do it, yeah,

577
00:44:33,419 --> 00:44:35,859
特别是，虽然我们必须这样做，是的，

578
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:39,379
 from your deep learning, then voice related,

578
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:39,379
从你的深度学习，然后是与语音相关的，

579
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:42,020
 then this is the image processing

579
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:42,020
那么这就是图像处理

580
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,939
 because we have this convolutional neural network,

580
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,939
因为我们有这个卷积神经网络

581
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:47,060
 and then you have the words,

581
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:47,060
然后你有话，

582
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,060
 so word actually can work to back,

582
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,060
所以词实际上可以起到作用，

583
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,620
 so it's the TF-ITF representation,

583
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,620
所以这是 TF-ITF 表示，

584
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,279
 they have word representation, then,

584
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,279
他们有单词表示，那么，

585
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,540
 also very important thing is the alpha goal,

585
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,540
同样非常重要的是阿尔法目标，

586
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,500
 so that is a big breakthrough,

586
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,500
所以这是一个很大的突破

587
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,740
 like you can really beat the champions in the world,

587
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,740
就像你真的可以击败世界冠军一样，

588
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,220
 I mean human, okay, so it's not able to,

588
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,220
我的意思是人类，好吧，所以它不能，

589
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,340
 it's beyond using symbolic,

589
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,340
它超出了使用象征性的范围，

590
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,460
 okay, symbolic approach is not possible,

590
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,460
好吧，符号方法是不可能的，

591
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,020
 so this is how actually I like to highlight this,

591
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,020
所以这实际上是我喜欢强调这一点的方式，

592
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,860
 alpha goal zero, so that means

592
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,860
阿尔法目标为零，所以这意味着

593
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,940
 you don't need to have samples, okay,

593
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,940
你不需要样品，好吧

594
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,860
 they just play with each other,

594
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,860
他们只是互相玩耍，

595
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,340
 and then they get a better, more authentic data set, right,

595
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,340
然后他们得到更好、更真实的数据集，对吧，

596
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,140
 so that is again based,

596
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,140
所以这又是基于，

597
00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:31,660
 and then transformer come into play,

597
00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:31,660
然后变压器开始发挥作用，

598
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,660
 so you have decoder, decoder, decoder,

598
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,660
所以你有解码器，解码器，解码器，

599
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,220
 so actually you can do the translation,

599
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,220
所以实际上你可以做翻译，

600
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,460
 you can follow the sequence,

600
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,460
你可以按照顺序，

601
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,020
 so it's very, very important for NLP,

601
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,020
所以这对于 NLP 来说非常非常重要，

602
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,620
 and then GPT, so again, transformer,

602
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,620
然后是 GPT，再一次，变压器，

603
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,020
 and then this is pre-trained,

603
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,020
然后这是预先训练的，

604
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:54,020
 it's large, start to have large language model,

604
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:54,020
它很大，开始有很大的语言模型，

605
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,740
 so then you come to have this,

605
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,740
那么你就会得到这个，

606
00:45:57,779 --> 00:46:00,299
 GPT-2, pre-trained large language model,

606
00:45:57,779 --> 00:46:00,299
GPT-2，预训练的大语言模型，

607
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:04,899
 so this one probably only have 1.6 billion parameters,

607
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:04,899
所以这个可能只有 16 亿个参数，

608
00:46:04,899 --> 00:46:09,979
 this one talking about 175 billion parameters,

608
00:46:04,899 --> 00:46:09,979
这个谈论的是 1750 亿个参数，

609
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:13,379
 the huge increase about the computation power,

609
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:13,379
计算能力的巨大提升，

610
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:14,979
 knowledge you can train,

610
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:14,979
您可以训练的知识，

611
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:18,259
 and the whole architecture will be much more complicated,

611
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:18,259
整个架构会变得更加复杂，

612
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:21,459
 then you can have those which is more suitable

612
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:21,459
那么你可以有那些更合适的

613
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:25,020
 for NLP process, okay, so it's not just translation,

613
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:25,020
对于 NLP 过程，好吧，所以这不仅仅是翻译，

614
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,940
 but much more NLP tasks, okay,

614
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,940
但还有更多 NLP 任务，好吧，

615
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,300
 including like not just a Q and A,

615
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,300
不仅仅是问答，

616
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,980
 not just a summarization,

616
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,980
不仅仅是总结，

617
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,940
 more including, more aware of the context information,

617
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,940
更多包括，更多地了解上下文信息，

618
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:38,740
 so you can actually attract the entity relationship,

618
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:38,740
这样你就可以真正吸引实体关系，

619
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,940
 and so on, okay, so that is a BERT,

619
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,940
等等，好吧，这就是 BERT，

620
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,860
 so BERT is more encoder, transformer base as well,

620
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,860
所以 BERT 更像是编码器、变压器基础，

621
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,020
 okay, then you have GPT-3,

621
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,020
好吧，那么你就有了 GPT-3，

622
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,860
 so it's again even bigger model,

622
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,860
所以它又是更大的模型，

623
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,060
 and then we have chatgpd finally come this API,

623
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,060
然后我们chatgpd终于有了这个API，

624
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,980
 everybody start to use it,

624
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,980
大家开始使用它，

625
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,259
 and within very, very short period of time,

625
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,259
并且在非常非常短的时间内，

626
00:46:57,259 --> 00:47:00,180
 the users increase dramatically, right,

626
00:46:57,259 --> 00:47:00,180
用户急剧增加，对吧，

627
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,980
 so we are one of it, yeah,

627
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,980
所以我们是其中之一，是的，

628
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,980
 and then also they can do text to image, right,

628
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,980
然后他们还可以将文本转换为图像，对吧，

629
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,180
 or text to drawings, so that is a del E,

629
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,180
或文字到图画，所以这是一个del E，

630
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,779
 and then mid-journey, yeah, those are important models,

630
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,779
然后在旅程中，是的，这些都是重要的模型，

631
00:47:16,779 --> 00:47:19,860
 and then we have four, I have, you know,

631
00:47:16,779 --> 00:47:19,860
然后我们有四个，我有，你知道，

632
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,460
 not just from OpenAI, now the Microsoft,

632
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,460
不仅仅是 OpenAI，现在还有微软，

633
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,580
 of course they also have this large language model,

633
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,580
当然他们也有这个大的语言模型，

634
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,900
 so they have a BART,

634
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,900
所以他们有 BART，

635
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,180
 and now which one you like most,

635
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,180
现在你最喜欢哪一个，

636
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,820
 you use BART, or you use chatgpd,

636
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,820
你使用 BART，或者你使用 chatgpd，

637
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:34,740
 or you use,

637
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:34,740
或者你使用，

638
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,180
 which one are you using?

638
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,180
你用的是哪一款？

639
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,820
 Chatgpd still the most, okay, chatgpd 4,

639
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,820
chatgpd还是最多的，好吧，chatgpd 4，

640
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,780
 or even 4.0, okay, okay,

640
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,780
甚至4.0，好吧，好吧，

641
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,100
 but if you want to mix the image together,

641
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,100
但如果你想将图像混合在一起，

642
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,620
 maybe you can try others as well, yeah,

642
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,620
也许你也可以尝试其他的，是的，

643
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,020
 so yeah, I want to highlight something like, okay,

643
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,020
所以是的，我想强调一些事情，比如，好吧，

644
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,260
 other than the technology here,

644
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,260
除了这里的技术之外，

645
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,940
 we also people start to realize the importance

645
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,940
我们也开始意识到重要性

646
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,260
 of having the control, right,

646
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,260
拥有控制权，对吧，

647
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,380
 the AI should have a governing,

647
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,380
人工智能应该有一个治理，

648
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,100
 should have a good policy,

648
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,100
应该有好的政策

649
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:15,660
 so we don't let the bad guy using the powerful system, okay,

649
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:15,660
所以我们不让坏人使用强大的系统，好吧，

650
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,420
 so it's a bit like a nuclear, you know,

650
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,420
所以它有点像核，你知道，

651
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,180
 put in some bad guy's hands,

651
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,180
落入坏人手中，

652
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,260
 then can be very dangerous,

652
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,260
那么可能会非常危险，

653
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,940
 imagine they use this for war, right,

653
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,940
想象他们用这个来战争，对吧，

654
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,060
 they use this design a soldier,

654
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,060
他们用这个设计一个士兵，

655
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,420
 and then to fight, yeah, or something,

655
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,420
然后去战斗，是的，或者什么的，

656
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,620
 it can be dangerous, okay,

656
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,620
这可能很危险，好吧，

657
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:35,420
 so that's why they have AI warning,

657
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:35,420
这就是为什么他们有人工智能警告，

658
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,980
 actually Professor Hinton, because of this,

658
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,980
实际上 Hinton 教授 因为这个

659
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,980
 he quit the, he was, is he working for Google, I forgot,

659
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,980
他辞职了，他是，他在谷歌工作吗，我忘了，

660
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,940
 and then he quit from the company,

660
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,940
然后他就从公司辞职了

661
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,900
 actually he become independent person,

661
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,900
事实上他成为了一个独立的人，

662
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,420
 so he actually want to give more warning

662
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,420
所以他其实想给予更多警告

663
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,660
 to talk about the importance of governing, okay,

663
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,660
谈论治理的重要性，好吧，

664
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:57,660
 I remember he was, I am 20, 21, 20, which one, which year,

664
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:57,660
我记得他是，我20岁，21岁，20岁，哪一年，哪一年，

665
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,900
 he was joking, he say, how come people worry about the AI,

665
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,900
他开玩笑说，为什么人们会担心人工智能，

666
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,580
 he think it's far away from dangerous weapon, you know,

666
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,580
他认为这远离危险武器，你知道，

667
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,380
 but he changed the mind,

667
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,380
但他改变了主意

668
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,980
 he realized, you know,

668
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,980
他意识到，你知道，

669
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,020
 with the development of the large language model,

669
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,020
随着大语言模型的发展，

670
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,980
 actually, it can be dangerous if not control it well, okay,

670
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,980
其实如果控制不好的话会很危险的好吧

671
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,780
 it will be used, if it will be used by some people,

671
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,780
它会被使用，如果它被某些人使用，

672
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:27,620
 which is with certain, we see the, you know, fake news,

672
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:27,620
可以肯定的是，我们看到了假新闻，

673
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,540
 the fake image, right, so how, who is going to use it,

673
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,540
假图像，对吧，那么如何，谁会使用它，

674
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,420
 if it's not governing properly,

674
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,420
如果治理不当

675
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,660
 then can be very bad for human being as well, okay,

675
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,660
那么对人类来说也会非常糟糕，好吧，

676
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,180
 it can be dangerous, yeah,

676
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,180
这可能很危险，是的，

677
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:46,180
 so now they here, this is 2024, yeah, so we are here,

677
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:46,180
所以现在他们在这里，这是 2024 年，是的，所以我们在这里，

678
00:49:46,419 --> 00:49:51,259
 they can see, you can see the, yeah, the Dell,

678
00:49:46,419 --> 00:49:51,259
他们可以看到，你可以看到，是的，戴尔，

679
00:49:51,259 --> 00:49:55,540
 actually, Sora, so Sora, yeah, they can even make a video,

679
00:49:51,259 --> 00:49:55,540
事实上，索拉，所以索拉，是的，他们甚至可以制作视频，

680
00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:00,100
 right, so text to video, so yeah, this is definitely,

680
00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:00,100
对，所以文字到视频，所以是的，这绝对是，

681
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,580
 can be a big impact, can create impact to those,

681
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,580
可以产生很大的影响，可以对那些人产生影响，

682
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:10,580
 like movie industry, you know, cartoon, you know,

682
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:10,580
就像电影业，你知道，卡通，你知道，

683
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,299
 how this, but hopefully, we take it positively,

683
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,299
这是怎么回事，但希望我们能积极地对待它，

684
00:50:14,299 --> 00:50:17,540
 so it's not just create negative impact to them,

684
00:50:14,299 --> 00:50:17,540
所以这不仅会给他们带来负面影响

685
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,900
 but actually, because you can use the tools,

685
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,900
但实际上，因为你可以使用这些工具，

686
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,940
 so it will actually enhance our understanding

686
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,940
所以它实际上会增强我们的理解

687
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,620
 or our thinking, then we can actually make use of this

687
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,620
或者我们的想法，那么我们实际上可以利用它

688
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,580
 to make even better movie, or even better,

688
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,580
制作更好的电影，甚至更好，

689
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,819
 more creativity involved by using them, right,

689
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,819
使用它们会带来更多创造力，对吧，

690
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:39,900
 to improve our work, okay,

690
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:39,900
改善我们的工作，好吧，

691
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,540
 so this is a quick look of this,

691
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,540
所以这是一个快速浏览，

692
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,700
 and this is based on this journalist,

692
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,700
这是根据这位记者的报道，

693
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,900
 they wrote something, yeah, mainly bias towards, you know,

693
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,900
他们写了一些东西，是的，主要是偏见，你知道，

694
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:53,020
 NLP or popular AI models, so I draw this picture

694
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:53,020
NLP或者流行的AI模型，所以我画了这张图

695
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:58,020
 just to visualize it, okay, this is, I use history

695
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:58,020
只是为了形象化它，好吧，这就是，我使用历史

696
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,820
 related to a symbolic AI, okay, from the,

696
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,820
与符号人工智能相关，好吧，来自，

697
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,660
 I think it's from Chad GBT, yeah, so this is, you know,

697
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,660
我认为这是来自 Chad GBT，是的，所以这是，你知道，

698
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:13,819
 we find basically, it's just, we have representation,

698
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:13,819
我们基本上发现，我们有代表性，

699
00:51:15,899 --> 00:51:19,779
 yeah, using the symbol and rules and logic,

699
00:51:15,899 --> 00:51:19,779
是的，使用符号、规则和逻辑，

700
00:51:19,779 --> 00:51:23,100
 and then those are the key characteristics,

700
00:51:19,779 --> 00:51:23,100
然后这些是关键特征，

701
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,140
 and they involve rule-based system,

701
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,140
它们涉及基于规则的系统，

702
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,819
 and then emphasis on the human readable,

702
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,819
然后强调人类可读性，

703
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:31,859
 and we can interpret the answer, okay,

703
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:31,859
我们可以解释答案，好吧，

704
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:35,100
 that is a very good thing for symbolic approach,

704
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:35,100
这对于符号方法来说是一件非常好的事情，

705
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,540
 because you can understand the reasoning,

705
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,540
因为你能明白其中的道理，

706
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,580
 the reasoning is based on logic way, okay,

706
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,580
推理是基于逻辑的方式，好吧，

707
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,140
 but not the data-driven, okay, data-driven,

707
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,140
但不是数据驱动的，好吧，数据驱动的，

708
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,820
 think about deep neural network, you get the answer,

708
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,820
思考一下深度神经网络，你就会得到答案，

709
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,020
 but you don't know how to interpret it well, right,

709
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,020
但你不知道如何很好地解释它，对吧，

710
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,380
 so that is a very important research area

710
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,380
所以这是一个非常重要的研究领域

711
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,140
 to see how to interpret it, okay, for the, that,

711
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,140
看看如何解释它，好吧，对于那个，

712
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:00,820
 this is talking about example, talking about advantages,

712
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:00,820
这是在谈论例子，谈论优点，

713
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,020
 so this is talking about, you know,

713
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,020
所以这就是说，你知道，

714
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,020
 what is symbolic AI good for, like for diagnosis,

714
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,020
符号人工智能有什么用处，比如诊断，

715
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,700
 and decision-making, also, at that time,

715
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,700
以及当时的决策，

716
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,780
 NLP, we have to rely on the grammar rules, okay,

716
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,780
NLP，我们得靠语法规则，好吧，

717
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,300
 and then try to use that to derive, to answer,

717
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,300
然后尝试用它来推导、回答

718
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,700
 compile, and then to understand the thing, okay,

718
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,700
编译，然后就明白了，好吧，

719
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,820
 so this is early stage, the symbolic AI, okay,

719
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,820
所以这是早期阶段，象征性人工智能，好吧，

720
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,060
 so the advantage is, actually, representation is,

720
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,060
所以优势实际上是代表性是

721
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,780
 need to make use of the main knowledge to represent it,

721
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,780
需要利用主要知识来表示它，

722
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:36,540
 so it's very much rely on the programmer or designer, okay,

722
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:36,540
所以这很大程度上取决于程序员或设计师，好吧，

723
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,900
 the challenging is, actually, very difficult

723
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,900
挑战实际上是非常困难的

724
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,900
 to handle uncertainty, and if it's information is incomplete,

724
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,900
处理不确定性 如果信息不完整

725
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:49,300
 and handle large data set, okay, then,

725
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:49,300
并处理大数据集，好吧，那么，

726
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,540
 especially for non-symbolic task, such as vision, okay,

726
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,540
特别是对于非符号任务，例如视觉，好吧，

727
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,700
 so vision image processing, that is not really easy

727
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,700
所以视觉图像处理，这并不容易

728
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,620
 to represent in a symbol, by symbols, right,

728
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,620
用符号来表示，用符号来表示，对吧，

729
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:07,140
 okay, I think this is talking about the early stage,

729
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:07,140
好吧，我想这是在谈论早期阶段，

730
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:12,460
 how the neural network start, so this is the simple model,

730
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:12,460
神经网络是如何启动的，这是一个简单的模型，

731
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:16,540
 okay, proposed by the gentleman here,

731
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:16,540
好吧，是这位先生提议的，

732
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,980
 so, Neurons Scientists and the Logicians,

732
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,980
所以，神经元科学家和逻辑学家，

733
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,460
 so you can see, yeah, they are really oversimplifies

733
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,460
所以你可以看到，是的，他们确实过于简单化了

734
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,859
 the whole thing, to see, okay, each of these is a cell,

734
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,859
整个事情，看看，好吧，每个都是一个细胞，

735
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:30,060
 and then you have input coming, so input is the output

735
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:30,060
然后你就有了输入，所以输入就是输出

736
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,820
 of the other neuron, multiply with the weight,

736
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,820
另一个神经元的权值乘以权重，

737
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,860
 and then become the input signal,

737
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,860
然后成为输入信号，

738
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,420
 and then how to combine those signal together,

738
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,420
然后如何将这些信号组合在一起，

739
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,700
 then passing on to the cell itself,

739
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,700
然后传递到细胞本身，

740
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,779
 and then get through the function,

740
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,779
然后通过函数，

741
00:53:43,779 --> 00:53:45,940
 and then get the output of it, okay,

741
00:53:43,779 --> 00:53:45,940
然后得到它的输出，好吧，

742
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,500
 so it's a very, very simple model,

742
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,500
所以这是一个非常非常简单的模型

743
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,980
 Turing test was the one to set to see how the program

743
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,980
图灵测试是为了查看程序如何运行而设置的

744
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,060
 answer the questions, whether you can tell this program

744
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,060
回答问题，你是否能说出这个程序

745
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,259
 is human or not human based on his reply,

745
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,259
根据他的回答是人类还是非人类，

746
00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:03,700
 okay, so that is to decide whether it can pass or not,

746
00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:03,700
好吧，那就决定能不能通过，

747
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:08,700
 and then you see, in a 2014, that was about six years

747
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:08,700
然后你看，在 2014 年，这大约是六年

748
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:14,140
 after Dr. Tulin, Alan Tulin passed away, six years,

748
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:14,140
在图林博士之后，艾伦·图林去世了六年，

749
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,700
 yeah, so actually they did this test,

749
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,700
是的，所以实际上他们做了这个测试，

750
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,020
 the program, although it's called Eugene,

750
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,020
这个程序虽然叫尤金，

751
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,420
 actually it's written by, it's a chatbot,

751
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,420
实际上它是由它编写的，它是一个聊天机器人，

752
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,180
 it's written by three researchers, okay,

752
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,180
它是由三位研究人员写的，好吧，

753
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,540
 and then they believe they already passed the test,

753
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,540
然后他们相信自己已经通过了测试，

754
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,660
 because 30% of judge believe this is a 13 years old boy,

754
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,660
因为30%的法官认为这是一个13岁的男孩，

755
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,419
 okay, cannot tell, it's a boy or it's a program,

755
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,419
好吧，分不清，是男孩还是程序，

756
00:54:34,419 --> 00:54:37,859
 so they believe they passed the Turing test already,

756
00:54:34,419 --> 00:54:37,859
所以他们相信他们已经通过了图灵测试，

757
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,940
 okay, and then that's why this gentleman,

757
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,940
好吧 这就是为什么这位先生

758
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,940
 must have, Sreeman, actually he is a co-founder

758
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,940
一定有，Sreeman，实际上他是联合创始人

759
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,859
 of the DeepMind, the DeepMind bought over by Google,

759
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,859
DeepMind，被谷歌收购的 DeepMind，

760
00:54:47,859 --> 00:54:49,740
 okay, so it's a Google, and then he now works

760
00:54:47,859 --> 00:54:49,740
好吧，那是谷歌，然后他现在工作了

761
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:53,259
 for the Microsoft, Microsoft AI CEO,

761
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:53,259
对于微软，微软人工智能首席执行官，

762
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,620
 so that's what he said, he last year, he said,

762
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,620
所以他就是这么说的，去年他说，

763
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:01,620
 okay, should let the robot having the money,

763
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:01,620
好吧，应该让机器人有钱，

764
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,620
 and then ask them to make money, okay,

764
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,620
然后让他们赚钱，好吧

765
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,780
 then it can become a millionaire,

765
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,780
那么它就可以成为百万富翁，

766
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,860
 that can pass the Turing test, okay,

766
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,860
可以通过图灵测试，好吧

767
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:16,860
 so that's what he suggested, 2023, June about there,

767
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:16,860
这就是他建议的，2023 年 6 月，

768
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,100
 okay, but I don't know, he said it's going to publish

768
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,100
好吧，但我不知道，他说要出版

769
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,420
 a paper to talk about this,

769
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,420
一篇论文来讨论这个问题，

770
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,140
 but we haven't seen the publication yet, okay,

770
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,140
但我们还没有看到该出版物，好吧，

771
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:29,860
 so very, very quickly look at the application,

771
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:29,860
所以非常非常快地查看应用程序，

772
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:34,860
 so you can see, firstly, about game,

772
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:34,860
所以你首先可以看到关于游戏，

773
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,860
 okay, so as I said, yeah, reasoning,

773
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,860
好吧，正如我所说，是的，推理，

774
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,000
 so why we want to do game,

774
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,000
那么为什么我们想做游戏，

775
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,220
 why we think game is a type of AI,

775
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,220
为什么我们认为游戏是人工智能的一种，

776
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,220
 why?

776
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,220
为什么？

777
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,260
 Why we don't say, actually write a program

777
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,260
为什么我们不说，实际编写一个程序

778
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,820
 which can print out your schedule for today,

778
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,820
它可以打印出你今天的日程安排，

779
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,140
 for example, this is not an AI program,

779
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,140
例如，这不是人工智能程序，

780
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,300
 why writing a game is an AI program?

780
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,300
为什么写游戏是AI程序？

781
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,580
 What's the difference, what's the key difference?

781
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,580
有什么区别，主要区别是什么？

782
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,980
 Writing a game, okay, play game,

782
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,980
写个游戏，好吧，玩游戏，

783
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,220
 do you think play game need intelligence?

783
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,220
你认为玩游戏需要智力吗？

784
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,660
 Especially complicated game,

784
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,660
尤其是复杂的游戏，

785
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,379
 although you know how to play,

785
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,379
虽然你知道怎么玩，

786
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,620
 you know the rules, for example, you know chess,

786
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,620
你知道规则，例如，你知道国际象棋，

787
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,140
 you know how to play goal,

787
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,140
你知道如何进球，

788
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,940
 but not everybody can win, right,

788
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,940
但不是每个人都能赢，对吧，

789
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:32,859
 somebody can win, somebody lose, yeah, so why?

789
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:32,859
有人会赢，有人会输，是的，那为什么呢？

790
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,140
 Although we know how to represent it,

790
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,140
虽然我们知道如何表示它，

791
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,940
 although we know the strategy,

791
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,940
虽然我们知道策略，

792
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,700
 we know the rules, but how to apply the rules

792
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,700
我们知道规则，但如何应用规则

793
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,620
 is very important, right, so that means

793
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,620
非常重要，对吧，所以这意味着

794
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,980
 it's decision making every step,

794
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,980
每一步都是决策

795
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:54,180
 and also you probably need to look ahead,

795
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:54,180
而且你可能需要向前看，

796
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:58,180
 a few step ahead in order to make a decision, right,

796
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:58,180
提前几步才能做出决定，对吧，

797
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:04,620
 so that's why this is intelligence involved,

797
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:04,620
所以这就是为什么这涉及情报，

798
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,900
 so that's why they try to design a program

798
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,900
这就是为什么他们尝试设计一个程序

799
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,940
 which can do something like this, okay,

799
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,940
可以做这样的事情，好吧，

800
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,700
 although the rules given,

800
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,700
尽管给出了规则，

801
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,380
 representation can be represented by symbols,

801
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,380
表示可以用符号表示，

802
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,460
 but then how to make it always win, for example,

802
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,460
但如何让它总是获胜，例如，

803
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,020
 or can they actually beat the human, human being,

803
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,020
或者他们真的能打败人类，人类，

804
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,060
 human players, right, so it's not easy,

804
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,060
人类玩家，对吧，所以这并不容易，

805
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,180
 then also with the limited resources,

805
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,180
那么在资源有限的情况下，

806
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:30,060
 computational resources, memory resources at that time,

806
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:30,060
当时的计算资源、内存资源，

807
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,740
 it's not easy, so that's why it's very challenging already,

807
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,740
这并不容易，所以这就是为什么它已经非常具有挑战性，

808
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,620
 so that is how the AI start, okay,

808
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,620
这就是人工智能的开始方式，好吧，

809
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,420
 so they use this to design the AI game,

809
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,420
所以他们用它来设计人工智能游戏，

810
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:43,420
 to design algorithms for game, okay,

810
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:43,420
为游戏设计算法，好吧，

811
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,460
 and also like proof, reasoning, okay,

811
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,460
也喜欢证明、推理，好吧，

812
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:50,340
 so again, mathematics proof, not everybody can do, right,

812
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:50,340
再说一遍，数学证明，不是每个人都能做到，对吧，

813
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,940
 although you know the working principle,

813
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,940
虽然知道工作原理，

814
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,060
 but you probably cannot prove it, prove something, okay,

814
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,060
但你可能无法证明这一点，证明一些事情，好吧，

815
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,540
 so that is a theory proving to start,

815
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,540
所以这是一个被证明是开始的理论，

816
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,820
 and then later, you know, language understanding,

816
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,820
然后，你知道，语言理解，

817
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,380
 yeah, so language understanding at that time,

817
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,380
是的，所以当时的语言理解，

818
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,100
 actually you can still follow the grammar rules

818
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,100
其实你仍然可以遵循语法规则

819
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,580
 and to check syntax checking, you know,

819
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,580
并检查语法检查，你知道，

820
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,540
 and so on, but yes, so that come into that,

820
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,540
等等，但是是的，因此，

821
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:17,540
 and then go into more challenging one,

821
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:17,540
然后进入更具挑战性的一个，

822
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,340
 like computer vision, computer vision is not so easy

822
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,340
就像计算机视觉一样，计算机视觉并不那么容易

823
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,700
 to be represented by symbols, right,

823
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,700
用符号来表示，对吧，

824
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,420
 so that is early part, which that's why neural network

824
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,420
这就是早期部分，这就是神经网络的原因

825
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,140
 in the early part is more focused on image,

825
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,140
前期比较注重形象，

826
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,220
 you know, representation, how to classify it,

826
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,220
你知道，表征，如何分类，

827
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,180
 how to classify it, and so on,

827
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,180
如何分类等等

828
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,380
 they're making a working machine, right, robots,

828
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,380
他们正在制造一台工作机器，对吧，机器人，

829
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,980
 so robot can do many, many things,

829
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,980
所以机器人可以做很多很多事情，

830
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:45,620
 like some robot designed for running or carry heavy things

830
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:45,620
就像一些专为跑步或搬运重物而设计的机器人

831
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,940
 to deliver to specific location, danger location,

831
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,940
运送到特定地点、危险地点、

832
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,420
 or actually some robot can do journalism,

832
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,420
或者实际上一些机器人可以做新闻工作，

833
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:56,660
 can do flipping, can do, you know, climbing, and so on,

833
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:56,660
可以做翻转，可以做，你知道，攀爬等等，

834
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:59,460
 so different purpose, and then expert system,

834
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:59,460
所以不同的目的，然后专家系统，

835
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,780
 yeah, many, many, many, okay, then just a quick look,

835
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,780
是的，很多很多很多，好吧，那就快速浏览一下，

836
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,220
 so that's why I convinced them game is very important,

836
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,220
所以这就是为什么我说服他们游戏非常重要，

837
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,140
 so that's why we start with game,

837
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,140
所以这就是我们从游戏开始的原因

838
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:12,140
 so first time in 1997, when the IBM Deep Blue

838
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:12,140
第一次是在 1997 年，当时 IBM Deep Blue

839
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:17,140
 actually can win the world champion for the chess,

839
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:17,140
居然能赢得国际象棋世界冠军，

840
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,259
 chess champion, it was very exciting things, okay,

840
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,259
国际象棋冠军，这是非常令人兴奋的事情，好吧，

841
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:23,740
 because it's a big achievement,

841
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:23,740
因为这是一项伟大的成就

842
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,220
 because chess is not so, is not toy problem,

842
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,220
因为国际象棋不是这样，不是玩具问题，

843
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,900
 and then the branch factor is about 35,

843
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,900
那么分支因子约为35，

844
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,779
 that means if you have one, one state,

844
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,779
这意味着如果你有一个、一个州，

845
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,500
 you can have 35 possible way to move to next one, okay,

845
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,500
你可以有 35 种可能的方式来移动到下一种，好吧，

846
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,180
 so every step is like this,

846
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,180
所以每一步都是这样的

847
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,180
 so can be quite challenging

847
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,180
所以可能相当具有挑战性

848
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,020
 for computer resources at that time, okay,

848
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,020
对于当时的电脑资源来说，好吧，

849
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:49,380
 so you see, but this is rule-based, yeah,

849
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:49,380
所以你看，但这是基于规则的，是的，

850
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:54,100
 so they actually win, so it's a very big news,

850
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:54,100
所以他们真的赢了 所以这是一个非常大的消息

851
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:59,100
 then actually in 2016, we come with the AlphaGo, okay,

851
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:59,100
然后实际上在 2016 年，我们推出了 AlphaGo，好吧，

852
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,380
 so this is really a big, big one,

852
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,380
所以这真的是一个非常非常大的事件

853
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:06,820
 because this is talking about goal,

853
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:06,820
因为这是在谈论目标，

854
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:10,340
 is not just about the chess, okay,

854
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:10,340
不仅仅是关于国际象棋，好吧，

855
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,340
 so chess actually is much simple,

855
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,340
所以国际象棋其实很简单

856
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:17,340
 so you can see the branch factor for goal is 250,

856
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:17,340
所以你可以看到目标的分支因子是 250，

857
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,180
 okay, so that is really beyond symbolic AI can handle,

857
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,180
好吧，这确实超出了符号人工智能可以处理的范围，

858
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,180
 so they have to rely on neural network,

858
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,180
所以他们必须依赖神经网络，

859
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,820
 so that time is already neural network approach,

859
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,820
所以那个时候已经是神经网络方法了，

860
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,220
 and then deep neural network approach,

860
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,220
然后是深度神经网络方法，

861
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:34,220
 and also combined with certain symbolic AI idea, okay,

861
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:34,220
还结合了某种象征性的AI理念，好吧，

862
01:00:37,939 --> 01:00:42,259
 and then two years later, they have this game,

862
01:00:37,939 --> 01:00:42,259
然后两年后，他们有了这个游戏，

863
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:44,459
 which is teamwork, okay,

863
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:44,459
这是团队合作，好吧，

864
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:48,020
 so OpenAI actually developed five members to play together,

864
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:48,020
所以OpenAI实际上开发了五个成员一起玩，

865
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,939
 I don't know how many of you play this Dota 2, any of you?

865
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,939
我不知道你们中有多少人玩过这个Dota 2，你们中有人吗？

866
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:58,020
 Yeah, so this one actually start to defeat the,

866
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:58,020
是的，所以这个实际上开始击败，

867
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,220
 in the beginning is defeat certain players

867
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,220
一开始就是击败某些玩家

868
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,180
 with a high skill, okay, so they have some score

868
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,180
技术高，好吧，所以他们有一些分数

869
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,220
 above 4,000, and then they play with these people,

869
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,220
4000以上，然后他们和这些人一起玩，

870
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,580
 and they win, and later they can play,

870
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,580
他们赢了，然后他们就可以比赛了，

871
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,700
 they can win the professional team,

871
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,700
他们能赢得职业队，

872
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,980
 okay, so that is really incredible,

872
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,980
好吧，这真是令人难以置信，

873
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,460
 at that time, actually Bill Gates said,

873
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,460
当时，其实比尔盖茨说，

874
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,259
 whoa, that is really a huge milestone, okay,

874
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,259
哇，这确实是一个巨大的里程碑，好吧，

875
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:23,820
 so very, very hard, because this is five members

875
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:23,820
非常非常难，因为这是五个成员

876
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:26,740
 work together, okay, so not a single player,

876
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:26,740
一起工作，好吧，所以不是一个人，

877
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:30,020
 I mean, not a single agent, it's five agent,

877
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:30,020
我的意思是，不是一个特工，而是五个特工，

878
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,180
 so really, really big achievement, okay,

878
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,180
真的，真的很大的成就，好吧，

879
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:36,459
 so that is the one, so that is one,

879
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:36,459
所以这就是一，所以这就是一，

880
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,580
 oh, one year later, actually, they can beat the,

880
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,580
哦，一年后，实际上，他们可以击败，

881
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,660
 really beat the top professional,

881
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,660
真正击败了顶尖职业选手，

882
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,939
 so this is just still beats the,

882
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,939
所以这仍然胜过，

883
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,299
 MM of some score, about 4,000 or something,

883
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,299
一些分数的MM，大概4000左右吧，

884
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:50,580
 it's not the totally professional player,

884
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:50,580
并不是完全职业选手，

885
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,419
 but it's the high skill players,

885
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,419
但都是高水平的选手

886
01:01:52,419 --> 01:01:53,339
 and then one year later,

886
01:01:52,419 --> 01:01:53,339
然后一年后，

887
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:56,220
 they can beat the professional players,

887
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:56,220
他们可以击败职业选手，

888
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:01,580
 and then we talk about, yeah, three years ago,

888
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:01,580
然后我们谈论，是的，三年前，

889
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:06,939
 actually, they developed this more general agent,

889
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:06,939
事实上，他们开发了这个更通用的代理，

890
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:09,279
 so it's no longer just play one type of game,

890
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:09,279
所以它不再只是玩一种类型的游戏，

891
01:02:09,279 --> 01:02:14,279
 they can play 500,000 different games,

891
01:02:09,279 --> 01:02:14,279
他们可以玩500,000种不同的游戏，

892
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,259
 okay, so one single agent, they can be trained,

892
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,259
好的，所以一个特工，他们可以接受训练，

893
01:02:18,259 --> 01:02:20,359
 play so many different kind of games,

893
01:02:18,259 --> 01:02:20,359
玩很多不同类型的游戏，

894
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:24,480
 so it's more, definitely one step towards

894
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:24,480
所以这绝对是朝着

895
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,040
 a more general AI kind of, right,

895
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,040
一种更通用的人工智能，对吧，

896
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,280
 because they are not trained just to play

896
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,280
因为他们不只是受过玩耍训练

897
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:35,120
 one type of thing, but many, many, many, okay,

897
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:35,120
一种类型的东西，但是很多很多很多，好吧，

898
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,160
 so that's why teamwork always refer to this,

898
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,160
所以这就是为什么团队合作总是提到这一点，

899
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,080
 and then, yeah, this is the time they trained it,

899
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,080
然后，是的，这是他们训练它的时候，

900
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,800
 and then Bill Gates made a comment,

900
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,800
然后比尔盖茨发表评论，

901
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,160
 he was very, very impressed by this.

901
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,160
他对此印象非常非常深刻。

902
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,880
 Okay, so this one, we just try to say,

902
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,880
好的，所以这个，我们只是想说，

903
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,880
 when Deep Blue win the world champion,

903
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,880
当深蓝夺得世界冠军时，

904
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:00,400
 actually, is that really our program very intelligent,

904
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:00,400
事实上，我们的程序真的非常智能吗？

905
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,040
 or actually, it's more about the computation power?

905
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,040
或者实际上，更多的是计算能力？

906
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,880
 Okay, so these slides try to tell us,

906
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,880
好的，这些幻灯片试图告诉我们，

907
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,880
 actually, it's probably still computation power, okay,

907
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,880
实际上，它可能仍然是计算能力，好吧，

908
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,360
 humans do have a better strategy,

908
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,360
人类确实有更好的策略，

909
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,840
 otherwise, there is no way to move

909
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,840
否则无法移动

910
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,080
 within such short period of time,

910
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,080
在这么短的时间内，

911
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,400
 and can still, actually, he only lose one,

911
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,400
事实上，他仍然只能失去一个，

912
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,680
 I think, duo or three or something,

912
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,680
我想，两人或三人或其他什么，

913
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,080
 so he still have a very good strategy to achieve that, okay,

913
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,080
所以他仍然有一个非常好的策略来实现这一目标，好吧，

914
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:34,240
 so that means our computer, although they win some game,

914
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:34,240
这意味着我们的计算机 尽管他们赢得了一些比赛

915
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,880
 but because probably more rely on the parallel processing,

915
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,880
但因为可能更多地依赖于并行处理，

916
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,440
 and memories, and they can look ahead,

916
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,440
和回忆，他们可以展望未来，

917
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,880
 many steps ahead, with the support

917
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,880
在支持下，前进了许多步

918
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,320
 of the computation ability, okay, but not the strategy,

918
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,320
计算能力，好的，但策略不是，

919
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,920
 not really the strategy.

919
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,920
不是真正的策略。

920
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,480
 Yeah, and this is talking about the self-taught,

920
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,480
是的，这是在谈论自学成才，

921
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,320
 because of the game developments,

921
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,320
由于游戏的发展，

922
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:02,320
 so this is, that's why DeepMind actually can use Google,

922
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:02,320
所以这就是为什么 DeepMind 实际上可以使用 Google，

923
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,320
 AlphaGo zero, so you don't need to have,

923
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,320
AlphaGo 零，所以你不需要，

924
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,560
 look into the data, but they actually play

924
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,560
查看数据，但他们实际上在玩

925
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,000
 against each other to do that, okay,

925
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,000
互相反对这样做，好吧，

926
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,280
 and then further, one year later,

926
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,280
然后更进一步，一年后，

927
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,600
 they, oh no, a few months later, they can even do better,

927
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,600
他们，哦不，几个月后，他们甚至可以做得更好，

928
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:21,160
 the Alpha zero can actually beat the AlphaGo zero, okay,

928
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:21,160
Alpha 零实际上可以击败 AlphaGo 零，好吧，

929
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:26,160
 so that is things, and this is a slide talking about,

929
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:26,160
这就是事情，这是一张幻灯片，

930
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,279
 they can do the Delta two, okay,

930
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,279
他们可以做三角洲二号，好吧，

931
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:33,400
 so that is the one about the teamwork.

931
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:33,400
这就是关于团队合作的问题。

932
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,600
 About theory proving, I like to highlight this one, okay,

932
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,600
关于理论证明，我想强调这一点，好吧，

933
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,200
 so DeepMind, again, DeepMind come out with this

933
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,200
所以 DeepMind 再次推出了这个

934
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,160
 called Alpha proof, and the Alpha geometry,

934
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,160
称为阿尔法证明和阿尔法几何，

935
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,960
 so actually, geometry two, so actually they can,

935
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,960
所以实际上，几何二，所以实际上他们可以，

936
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,480
 they actually got the silver medal

936
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,480
他们实际上获得了银牌

937
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:56,279
 for the international mass Olympia, okay,

937
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:56,279
为了国际大众奥林匹亚，好吧，

938
01:04:56,279 --> 01:05:00,839
 only one marker away to get gold medal, okay,

938
01:04:56,279 --> 01:05:00,839
距离获得金牌仅差一分，好吧

939
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:04,799
 very impressive, right, so their program actually can,

939
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:04,799
非常令人印象深刻，对吧，所以他们的程序实际上可以，

940
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:09,120
 you know, like play with, you know,

940
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:09,120
你知道，喜欢玩，你知道，

941
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,640
 attending this competition, they can use the program

941
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,640
参加本次比赛，他们可以使用该程序

942
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,640
 to get the chief very high score, okay,

942
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,640
获得酋长很高的分数，好吧，

943
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:23,520
 and then, yeah, so some exciting progress made,

943
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:23,520
然后，是的，取得了一些令人兴奋的进展，

944
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,080
 actually I use this bot to ask, you know,

944
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,080
实际上我用这个机器人来问，你知道，

945
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,839
 what is the progress made in theory proving,

945
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,839
理论上取得的进展证明了什么，

946
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:37,359
 and this is the answer they give me,

946
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:37,359
这就是他们给我的答案，

947
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,799
 so that's how we can learn now, yeah,

947
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,799
这就是我们现在可以学习的方式，是的，

948
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,640
 I think that's true, the things they got for us, okay,

948
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,640
我认为这是真的，他们为我们带来的东西，好吧，

949
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,200
 and then natural language understanding,

949
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,200
然后是自然语言理解，

950
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,440
 we know it start from like theory,

950
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,440
我们知道它是从类似的理论开始的，

951
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,760
 like have a personal assistant, until, you know,

951
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,760
就像有一个私人助理，直到，你知道，

952
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,040
 Google Llama, and then they have this,

952
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,040
谷歌骆驼，然后他们有这个，

953
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,600
 wow, very impressive conversation,

953
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,600
哇，非常令人印象深刻的谈话，

954
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,120
 and now it's nothing, okay, when the chat GPT come,

954
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,120
现在没什么了，好吧，当聊天 GPT 出现时，

955
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,240
 and then you can see, you know, you ask about,

955
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,240
然后你可以看到，你知道，你问，

956
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,080
 show me image of Paris, they will show you the image,

956
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,080
给我看巴黎的图片，他们会给你看图片，

957
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,480
 and together with description, this is very, very good,

957
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,480
加上描述，这非常非常好，

958
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,440
 so combined with text, with image as well,

958
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,440
所以与文字结合，也与图像结合，

959
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,120
 you know, highlight the things,

959
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,120
你知道，突出这些事情，

960
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,680
 and for face recognition, voice recognition,

960
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,680
以及人脸识别、语音识别、

961
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,600
 also huge progress made, right, so, yeah,

961
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,600
也取得了巨大的进步，对，所以，是的，

962
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:28,120
 still very, very useful for industry,

962
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:28,120
对工业界仍然非常非常有用，

963
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:32,120
 and the progress there, very impressive, yeah,

963
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:32,120
那里的进展非常令人印象深刻，是的，

964
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,640
 can you tell which one is a fake, which one is a real,

964
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,640
你能分辨出哪个是假的哪个是真的吗

965
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,720
 it's very hard, right,

965
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,720
非常难，对吧，

966
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:42,120
 okay, yeah, this is fake news, fake image, you know,

966
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:42,120
好吧，是的，这是假新闻，假图片，你知道，

967
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,160
 it's a very big thing, and then self-driving,

967
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,160
这是一件非常大的事情，然后是自动驾驶，

968
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,879
 yeah, I think this is a very important area,

968
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,879
是的，我认为这是一个非常重要的领域，

969
01:06:50,879 --> 01:06:55,879
 and I didn't even update, nowadays really become like,

969
01:06:50,879 --> 01:06:55,879
我什至没有更新，现在真的变成这样了，

970
01:06:56,839 --> 01:06:59,359
 many places already make use of it,

970
01:06:56,839 --> 01:06:59,359
很多地方已经在使用了

971
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:04,000
 our NTU also have, is that fully in use already,

971
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:04,000
我们南洋理工大学也有，已经完全投入使用了，

972
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,960
 from our shuttle, I mean, our shuttle from the pioneer

972
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,960
从我们的航天飞机上，我的意思是，我们的先锋航天飞机

973
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,200
 to campus, is that already self-drive,

973
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,200
到校园了，已经是自驾了，

974
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,040
 I know they are testing, but I'm not sure

974
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,040
我知道他们正在测试，但我不确定

975
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:18,440
 whether they are totally, totally self-driving now,

975
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:18,440
他们现在是否完全、完全自动驾驶，

976
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:24,400
 I didn't check, huh, not yet, no, yeah, I know it's still,

976
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:24,400
我没有检查，呵呵，还没有，不，是的，我知道它还在，

977
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,160
 I can still see the driver,

977
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,160
我仍然可以看到司机

978
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,960
 but they are still testing the road,

978
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,960
但他们仍在测试道路，

979
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,960
 I think they aim for that, to release it,

979
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,960
我认为他们的目标是释放它，

980
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,040
 okay, very cool robots, so this one I like most,

980
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,040
好吧，非常酷的机器人，所以我最喜欢这个，

981
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:40,040
 okay, see, this one, they can cook 5,000 dishes,

981
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:40,040
好吧，你看，这个，他们可以做5000道菜，

982
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,160
 wow, so nice, okay, yeah, but it's totally functioning,

982
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,160
哇，太好了，好吧，是的，但是它完全可以工作，

983
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,400
 okay, the only thing is too expensive,

983
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,400
还好吧，唯一就是太贵了

984
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,080
 so too expensive to be in the market, okay,

984
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,080
市场上太贵了，好吧

985
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:56,200
 so too big probably, or too expensive is a main thing,

985
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:56,200
所以可能太大了，或者太贵是主要问题，

986
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,720
 otherwise, so if any of you, yeah, interested in this,

986
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,720
否则，如果你们中有人对此感兴趣，

987
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,040
 yeah, try to make it handy and less expensive,

987
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,040
是的，尽量让它方便并且便宜，

988
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,600
 it'll be a huge market there, okay,

988
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,600
那里将会是一个巨大的市场，好吧

989
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:10,600
 so it's no longer, you know, those dancing,

989
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:10,600
所以你知道，不再是那些跳舞的人，

990
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,160
 oh, it's so impressive, right, they can actually jump

990
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,160
哦，太令人印象深刻了，对吧，他们真的可以跳

991
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,319
 and they're on even surfaces, so every step, actually,

991
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,319
它们位于平坦的表面上 所以实际上每一步

992
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:19,719
 they need to make decision, they need to know

992
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:19,719
他们需要做出决定，他们需要知道

993
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:23,719
 how to keep them balanced, so it's very, very useful,

993
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:23,719
如何保持它们平衡，所以它非常非常有用，

994
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:28,599
 and also more engineered arts, you know,

994
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:28,599
还有更多工程艺术，你知道，

995
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,160
 so this is really like a real person with a voice,

995
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,160
所以这真的就像一个有声音的真人，

996
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:37,160
 and with more looks like a human robot, okay,

996
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:37,160
而且看起来更像人类机器人，好吧，

997
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,720
 then they can actually talk to human, yeah,

997
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,720
然后他们就可以和人类交谈了，是的，

998
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,520
 so this also, the latest update you can find here,

998
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,520
所以这也是您可以在这里找到的最新更新，

999
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,960
 so this is the more human-like, okay, so it's not,

999
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,960
所以这更像人类，好吧，所以不是，

1000
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,640
 that's why we say it's different aspect,

1000
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,640
这就是为什么我们说它是不同的方面，

1001
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,960
 how you expect this robot to be, so human-like,

1001
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,960
你期望这个机器人是怎样的，如此像人类，

1002
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,320
 you probably want them to do the healthcare,

1002
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,320
你可能希望他们做医疗保健，

1003
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,040
 and all it has to do with human conversation,

1003
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,040
以及所有与人类对话有关的事情，

1004
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,479
 the human touch, probably more,

1004
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,479
人情味，可能更多，

1005
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,399
 can have emotion expression, you know,

1005
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,399
可以有情感表达，你知道，

1006
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:09,799
 can respond to you like a human,

1006
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:09,799
可以像人类一样回应你，

1007
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:11,080
 and then another type of robot,

1007
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:11,080
然后是另一种类型的机器人，

1008
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,519
 which is more like a carry out certain tasks,

1008
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,519
这更像是执行某些任务，

1009
01:09:14,519 --> 01:09:17,960
 like go deep down to the mountain to do some,

1009
01:09:14,519 --> 01:09:17,960
比如到大山深处去做一些事情，

1010
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,080
 fetch something, you know, human heart to be deployed there,

1010
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,080
拿一些东西，你知道，人类的心脏部署在那里，

1011
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,599
 so it's a very different type of thing, yeah,

1011
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,599
所以这是一种非常不同类型的事情，是的，

1012
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:29,600
 so this is example for that, to update it,

1012
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:29,600
这是一个例子，更新它，

1013
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:35,680
 yeah, expert system, so looks like this was one in China,

1013
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:35,680
是的，专家系统，看起来这是在中国的，

1014
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,360
 they had this, you know, help to do the diagnosis,

1014
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,360
他们有这个，你知道，可以帮助诊断，

1015
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,760
 yeah, four years ago, and also they pass the exam, okay,

1015
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,760
是的，四年前，他们也通过了考试，好吧，

1016
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,360
 they pass, they can understand all the 40,

1016
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,360
他们通过了，他们能理解所有40个，

1017
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:52,360
 53 medical textbook, and they can pass the exam quite well,

1017
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:52,360
53本医学教材，而且都能很好地通过考试，

1018
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:58,120
 okay, so GP will be replaced by them, okay,

1018
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:58,120
好吧，那么GP就会被他们取代，好吧，

1019
01:09:59,839 --> 01:10:03,120
 also, yeah, this is about large language model, right,

1019
01:09:59,839 --> 01:10:03,120
另外，是的，这是关于大语言模型的，对吧，

1020
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,160
 so we talk about this popular one,

1020
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,160
所以我们来谈谈这个流行的，

1021
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,639
 and then the one from Google,

1021
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,639
然后是来自谷歌的，

1022
01:10:07,639 --> 01:10:09,920
 and then from the Google as well,

1022
01:10:07,639 --> 01:10:09,920
然后也来自谷歌，

1023
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,759
 human-like, actually, yeah, it's more advanced,

1023
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,759
和人类一样，实际上，是的，它更先进，

1024
01:10:12,759 --> 01:10:17,759
 so you can actually have the different model,

1024
01:10:12,759 --> 01:10:17,759
所以你实际上可以拥有不同的模型，

1025
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,320
 so this is the number of parameters,

1025
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,320
所以这是参数的数量，

1026
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,600
 you can see how the size increased, okay,

1026
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,600
你可以看到尺寸如何增加，好吧，

1027
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,560
 so hardware is very, very important, right, for the AI,

1027
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,560
所以硬件对于人工智能来说非常非常重要，

1028
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,040
 so you have to fine tune these parameters,

1028
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,040
所以你必须微调这些参数，

1029
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,640
 so your hardware, that's why the price

1029
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,640
所以你的硬件，这就是价格的原因

1030
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,760
 for those hardware AI company go up so dramatically,

1030
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,760
对于那些硬件AI公司涨幅如此之大，

1031
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,760
 yeah, so this is a highlight about the generative model

1031
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,760
是的，所以这是生成模型的一个亮点

1032
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,440
 in large language model, in NLP,

1032
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,440
在大语言模型中，在NLP中，

1033
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,960
 or natural language understanding,

1033
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,960
或自然语言理解，

1034
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,720
 then this is about computer vision,

1034
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,720
那么这是关于计算机视觉的，

1035
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:59,000
 image generation, or deep dream,

1035
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:59,000
图像生成，或深沉的梦想，

1036
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,040
 and then they can have image describe,

1036
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,040
然后他们可以进行图像描述，

1037
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,040
 you know, you use words to describe,

1037
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,040
你知道，你用文字来描述，

1038
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,560
 and then they generate the image for us,

1038
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,560
然后他们为我们生成图像，

1039
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,480
 and you can also select the style,

1039
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,480
还可以选择款式，

1040
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,360
 and select something which is,

1040
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,360
并选择一些东西，

1041
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,040
 looks like a really like a photo,

1041
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,040
看起来真的很像照片，

1042
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,719
 some very beautiful, okay,

1042
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,719
有些很漂亮，好吧，

1043
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,320
 then possible new application,

1043
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,320
那么可能的新应用程序，

1044
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,240
 this is also I asked Chet GBT, okay, highlight me this,

1044
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,240
这也是我问 Chet GBT，好吧，给我强调一下，

1045
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:27,160
 and they can really give me some meaningful suggestions,

1045
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:27,160
他们确实能给我一些有意义的建议，

1046
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,160
 like for example, personalization,

1046
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,160
例如，个性化、

1047
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,320
 so you can actually offer this personalizer,

1047
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,320
所以你实际上可以提供这个个性化服务，

1048
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,880
 recommendation and responses,

1048
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,880
建议和回应，

1049
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,000
 based on user preference and so on, yeah, true,

1049
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,000
基于用户偏好等，是的，是的，

1050
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,240
 you know, those are the things,

1050
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,240
你知道，这些就是事情，

1051
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:45,240
 and then industry, how the industry will be affected,

1051
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:45,240
然后是行业，这个行业将受到怎样的影响，

1052
01:11:45,519 --> 01:11:47,480
 so this is related industry,

1052
01:11:45,519 --> 01:11:47,480
所以这是相关行业，

1053
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:50,360
 with a very good large language model,

1053
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:50,360
拥有非常好的大型语言模型，

1054
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,360
 and those will be future applications,

1054
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,360
这些将是未来的应用，

1055
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,920
 top 10 application, yeah, here are the top 10,

1055
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,920
前 10 个应用程序，是的，这是前 10 个应用程序，

1056
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,679
 so even finance, trading,

1056
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,679
所以即使是金融、贸易、

1057
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:04,679
 also cybersecurity, drug discovery,

1057
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:04,679
还有网络安全、药物发现、

1058
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:06,519
 or just talk about drug discovery,

1058
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:06,519
或者只是谈论药物发现，

1059
01:12:06,519 --> 01:12:09,160
 this is the one, right, alpha fold,

1059
01:12:06,519 --> 01:12:09,160
这是右边的 alpha 折叠，

1060
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,280
 yeah, so this is so impressive,

1060
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,280
是的，所以这太令人印象深刻了

1061
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,840
 and I like highlight this one, alpha fold three,

1061
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,840
我喜欢强调这个，阿尔法折叠三，

1062
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,720
 okay, so this is talking about,

1062
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,720
好吧，所以这就是说，

1063
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,480
 they can predict structure and interactions

1063
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,480
他们可以预测结构和相互作用

1064
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,680
 of all of the live molecules,

1064
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,680
所有的活分子，

1065
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,080
 okay, so beyond no longer just protein,

1065
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,080
好吧，所以不仅仅是蛋白质，

1066
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,200
 but all the molecules, okay,

1066
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,200
但所有的分子，好吧，

1067
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,000
 so that is really very, very impressive,

1067
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,000
所以这真的非常非常令人印象深刻

1068
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,639
 because this is a hugely,

1068
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,639
因为这是一个巨大的、

1069
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:36,720
 can create huge impact to the drug industry,

1069
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:36,720
可以对制药行业产生巨大的影响，

1070
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,680
 and also the medicine, medicine,

1070
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,680
还有药，药，

1071
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,800
 and also the medical, you know, analysis, everything,

1071
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,800
还有医学，你知道，分析，一切，

1072
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,720
 this is very impressive, okay, arts,

1072
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,720
这非常令人印象深刻，好吧，艺术，

1073
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,480
 okay, so this arts related,

1073
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,480
好吧，所以这与艺术有关，

1074
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:54,760
 now E3 now, okay, so they can actually generate the images,

1074
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:54,760
现在 E3 好了，所以他们实际上可以生成图像，

1075
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,480
 so impressive, not just a style,

1075
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,480
如此令人印象深刻，不仅仅是一种风格，

1076
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:04,480
 but also, you know, yeah, take a look at those website,

1076
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:04,480
而且，你知道，是的，看看那些网站，

1077
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,959
 find out the details, yeah, get the video,

1077
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,959
了解详情，是的，获取视频，

1078
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:12,959
 so this is Sora, so you can see the video can be generated,

1078
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:12,959
这是 Sora，所以你可以看到视频可以生成，

1079
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,679
 okay, and then one slide is about governing

1079
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,679
好的，然后一张幻灯片是关于治理的

1080
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:22,280
 and the human right, civil rights, okay, for robots,

1080
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:22,280
还有人权，公民权利，好吧，对于机器人来说，

1081
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:26,120
 so talking about Sophia is going to be a citizen,

1081
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:26,120
所以谈论索菲亚将成为一名公民，

1082
01:13:27,799 --> 01:13:30,280
 it's already a citizen, sorry,

1082
01:13:27,799 --> 01:13:30,280
已经是公民了，抱歉

1083
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,519
 she's already a citizen in 2017, okay,

1083
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,519
她在2017年就已经是公民了，好吧，

1084
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,960
 then this Dr. David Hanson talk about,

1084
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,960
然后大卫·汉森博士谈到，

1085
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:44,000
 predict, you know, technology grow become uncontrollable,

1085
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:44,000
预测，你知道，技术的发展变得不可控，

1086
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,200
 so need to be very careful with this,

1086
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,200
所以需要非常小心这一点

1087
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:50,720
 and we are talking about the race between the wisdom,

1087
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:50,720
我们正在谈论智慧之间的竞赛，

1088
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,000
 human, and also the technology power, okay,

1088
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,000
人类，还有科技力量，好吧，

1089
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,520
 so need to keep a good balance,

1089
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,520
所以需要保持良好的平衡，

1090
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,480
 otherwise, it can be dangerous, okay.

1090
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,480
不然的话，可能会很危险，好吧。

1091
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:04,959
 What's next, so key challenges, I try to highlight,

1091
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:04,959
接下来，我试图强调关键的挑战，

1092
01:14:04,959 --> 01:14:08,400
 so this can be useful for future research area,

1092
01:14:04,959 --> 01:14:08,400
所以这对未来的研究领域很有用，

1093
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,240
 to look into it, yeah, how to handle ambiguity,

1093
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,240
去研究一下，是的，如何处理歧义，

1094
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:16,240
 for example, and how to learn the common sense knowledge,

1094
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:16,240
比如如何学习常识知识，

1095
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,120
 because some common sense, we just know about

1095
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,120
因为一些常识，我们只知道

1096
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,799
 how to pass on to computer, yeah,

1096
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,799
怎么传到电脑上啊

1097
01:14:21,799 --> 01:14:23,799
 and also how to handle the fake one,

1097
01:14:21,799 --> 01:14:23,799
以及如何处理假货，

1098
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:27,799
 and then computer and machine vision,

1098
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:27,799
然后是计算机和机器视觉，

1099
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,680
 those fake faces, fake news, auto drive,

1099
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,680
那些假面孔、假新闻、汽车驾驶，

1100
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,280
 reinforced learning, that is still something,

1100
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,280
强化学习，这仍然是东西，

1101
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,240
 it's good progress in those areas,

1101
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,240
这些领域都取得了良好的进展

1102
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:42,200
 but still have things to be done, okay.

1102
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:42,200
但还有事情要做，好吧。

1103
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,880
 What's next, so based on these boom bursts,

1103
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,880
接下来，基于这些繁荣的爆发，

1104
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:50,880
 last month, they list out, you know, stage of AI,

1104
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:50,880
上个月，他们列出了人工智能的阶段，

1105
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,800
 so chatbot is considered as level one,

1105
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,800
所以聊天机器人被认为是第一级，

1106
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,240
 then reasoners, so you can have reasoning,

1106
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,240
然后是推理机，这样你就可以推理，

1107
01:14:57,519 --> 01:14:59,719
 agents, so you can actually take actions,

1107
01:14:57,519 --> 01:14:59,719
代理，这样您就可以实际采取行动，

1108
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:03,920
 moving around, and then you can actually inventing things,

1108
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:03,920
四处走动，然后你就可以真正发明东西，

1109
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,840
 next level, and then you become, you know,

1109
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,840
下一个层次，然后你就会变得，你知道，

1110
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:11,320
 can organize everything, so that would be more towards

1110
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:11,320
可以组织一切，这样会更有利于

1111
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:16,320
 a super intelligence or super AI or general AI, okay.

1111
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:16,320
超级智能或超级人工智能或通用人工智能，好吧。

1112
01:15:18,599 --> 01:15:22,980
 So take a look, Singapore, okay, we are here,

1112
01:15:18,599 --> 01:15:22,980
所以看看，新加坡，好吧，我们在这里，

1113
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:28,500
 in term of global AI index, they measure talents,

1113
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:28,500
在全球人工智能指数方面，他们衡量的是人才，

1114
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,860
 infrastructure, you know, government involved, and so on,

1114
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,860
基础设施，你知道，政府参与等等，

1115
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:36,059
 so you see other than US and China, Singapore is here,

1115
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:36,059
所以你看除了美国和中国之外，还有新加坡，

1116
01:15:36,059 --> 01:15:38,660
 yeah, especially you see operating environment,

1116
01:15:36,059 --> 01:15:38,660
是的，尤其是你看到操作环境，

1117
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:43,660
 very high, and government strategy is very good,

1117
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:43,660
非常高，而且政府的策略非常好，

1118
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,940
 so you can see we are here,

1118
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,940
所以你可以看到我们在这里，

1119
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:49,980
 we are before all those big players as well,

1119
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:49,980
我们也领先于所有那些大玩家，

1120
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:54,900
 and also look at Singapore position for the investments

1120
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:54,900
并看看新加坡的投资状况

1121
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:59,900
 from private investments worldwide, so yeah,

1121
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:59,900
来自世界各地的私人投资，所以是的，

1122
01:16:00,259 --> 01:16:05,099
 we are more than Japan, like Australia, and so on,

1122
01:16:00,259 --> 01:16:05,099
我们不仅仅是日本，像澳大利亚等等，

1123
01:16:05,099 --> 01:16:10,099
 so it's good opportunity here, okay, so that's all,

1123
01:16:05,099 --> 01:16:10,099
所以这是一个很好的机会，好吧，就这样，

1124
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:16,940
 okay, that's all for my lecture one, lecture one, okay.

1124
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:16,940
好啦，我的第一讲就到这里了，第一讲，好啦。

1125
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:22,620
 So we still have, yeah, we still have two more lectures,

1125
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:22,620
所以我们还有，是的，我们还有两场讲座，

1126
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:32,660
 to start talk about state-based representation and search,

1126
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:32,660
开始谈论基于状态的表示和搜索，

1127
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:40,780
 maybe five minutes break, or no break, do you need a break?

1127
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:40,780
也许休息五分钟，或者不休息，你需要休息吗？

1128
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:46,540
 This is very much introduction, no break, huh?

1128
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:46,540
这是非常多的介绍，没有休息，是吧？

1129
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:52,019
 Oh, break, five minutes break.

1129
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:52,019
哦，休息，休息五分钟。

1130
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:52,860
 Okay.

1130
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:52,860
好的。

1131
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:13,860
 Hi, yes.

1131
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:13,860
嗨，是的。

1132
01:17:14,019 --> 01:17:18,420
 The quiz on week five is more depending on the program

1132
01:17:14,019 --> 01:17:18,420
第五周的测验更多地取决于课程

1133
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:19,740
 or the exercise.

1133
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:19,740
或练习。

1134
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:24,740
 Multiple question, concept, not program, no programming.

1134
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:24,740
多个问题，概念，不是程序，没有编程。

1135
01:17:36,299 --> 01:17:39,179
 We cannot find the past materials.

1135
01:17:36,299 --> 01:17:39,179
我们找不到过去的材料。

1136
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:41,059
 Oh, are you sure?

1136
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:41,059
哦，你确定吗？

1137
01:17:42,139 --> 01:17:42,980
 Hey, how come?

1137
01:17:42,139 --> 01:17:42,980
嘿，怎么会呢？

1138
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,820
 Oh, only topic one?

1138
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,820
哦，只有主题一？

1139
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:46,660
 Yeah, yeah.

1139
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:46,660
是啊是啊。

1140
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,660
 Then who make it not available?

1140
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,660
那么谁让它不可用呢？

1141
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:50,500
 I already make it available.

1141
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:50,500
我已经提供了。

1142
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,460
 Oh, yeah, it's strange, okay, okay.

1142
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,460
哦，是的，这很奇怪，好吧，好吧。

1143
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:58,059
 Somebody changed it.

1143
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:58,059
有人改变了它。

1144
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:04,500
 Yes.

1144
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:04,500
是的。

1145
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,099
 Two, two, three.

1145
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,099
二，二，三。

1146
01:18:22,099 --> 01:18:26,380
 Well, this lesson being open next semester.

1146
01:18:22,099 --> 01:18:26,380
嗯，这节课下学期开放。

1147
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:29,940
 Next semester, not sure, it's not confirmed yet.

1147
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:29,940
下学期，不确定，还没有确定。

1148
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:34,460
 I think depends because every of us actually have a lot

1148
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:34,460
我认为这取决于我们每个人实际上都有很多

1149
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:38,019
 teaching next semester, but likely they probably want

1149
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:38,019
下学期教书，但他们可能想要

1150
01:18:38,019 --> 01:18:41,940
 to push for it because it is a very long waiting list,

1150
01:18:38,019 --> 01:18:41,940
推动它，因为等待名单很长，

1151
01:18:42,019 --> 01:18:43,980
 but up to the school to decide.

1151
01:18:42,019 --> 01:18:43,980
但由学校决定。

1152
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,379
 But actually you can take other courses,

1152
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,379
但其实你可以选修其他课程，

1153
01:18:53,379 --> 01:18:57,099
 other similar one like pattern recognition,

1153
01:18:53,379 --> 01:18:57,099
其他类似的，如模式识别，

1154
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:00,460
 also which one, pattern recognition will be next semester,

1154
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:00,460
还有哪一个，模式识别将在下学期，

1155
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:05,460
 I think, and also the NLP next semester.

1155
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:05,460
我想，下学期还有NLP。

1156
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,580
 I have a question.

1156
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,580
我有一个问题。

1157
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:19,580
 Do I team up with a classmate from tomorrow class?

1157
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:19,580
我要和明天班级的同学组队吗？

1158
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:25,019
 Can, can, as long as he's post-grad.

1158
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:25,019
可以，可以，只要他是研究生。

1159
01:19:25,019 --> 01:19:26,259
 Okay.

1159
01:19:25,019 --> 01:19:26,259
好的。

1160
01:19:26,259 --> 01:19:29,259
 Cannot be undergrad because the requirement is different.

1160
01:19:26,259 --> 01:19:29,259
不能是本科生，因为要求不同。

1161
01:19:29,259 --> 01:19:31,259
 Okay, okay, thank you.

1161
01:19:29,259 --> 01:19:31,259
好的，好的，谢谢。

1162
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:12,780
 Okay.

1162
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:12,780
好的。

1163
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:42,780
 Okay.

1163
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:42,780
好的。

1164
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:12,780
 Okay.

1164
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:12,780
好的。

1165
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:42,780
 Okay.

1165
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:42,780
好的。

1166
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:12,780
 Okay.

1166
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:12,780
好的。

1167
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:42,780
 Okay.

1167
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:42,780
好的。

1168
01:23:12,379 --> 01:23:13,219
 Hello.

1168
01:23:12,379 --> 01:23:13,219
你好。

1169
01:23:15,219 --> 01:23:18,940
 Hello, hello, hello.

1169
01:23:15,219 --> 01:23:18,940
你好，你好，你好。

1170
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,179
 Okay, shall we go back to study?

1170
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,179
好吧，我们回去学习吧？

1171
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:32,860
 Yeah, I have no idea why the topic two was not available.

1171
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:32,860
是的，我不知道为什么主题二不可用。

1172
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:35,179
 So I just make it available now.

1172
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:35,179
所以我现在就提供它。

1173
01:23:35,179 --> 01:23:37,500
 Can you see now, NTU Learn?

1173
01:23:35,179 --> 01:23:37,500
NTU Learn，你现在能看到吗？

1174
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:43,500
 Topic two for lecture two to five, or two to six?

1174
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:43,500
第二到第五课的主题二，还是第二到第六课的主题二？

1175
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:50,100
 Or two to five, yes.

1175
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:50,100
或者两到五个，是的。

1176
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,260
 Can see now, huh?

1176
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,260
现在可以看到了吧？

1177
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,100
 Okay.

1177
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,100
好的。

1178
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:56,300
 Yeah, I think they said something they said probably

1178
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:56,300
是的，我想他们说了一些他们可能说过的话

1179
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,580
 because of the few add and drop.

1179
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,580
因为添加和删除的次数很少。

1180
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:02,860
 So they just put one week's slides,

1180
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:02,860
所以他们只放了一周的幻灯片

1181
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:07,260
 but actually one week is already including the topic two.

1181
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:07,260
但实际上一周已经包括主题二了。

1182
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,340
 Okay.

1182
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,340
好的。

1183
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:21,580
 Okay, so now let's start to discuss the symbolic AI.

1183
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:21,580
好的，现在我们开始讨论符号AI。

1184
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,300
 So we are done with introduction.

1184
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,300
这样我们就完成了介绍。

1185
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:26,180
 Okay, very, very, very brief introduction

1185
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:26,180
好的，非常非常非常简单的介绍

1186
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:28,980
 and highlight some key applications.

1186
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:28,980
并重点介绍一些关键应用。

1187
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:31,660
 It's a mix of the symbolic AI-based approach

1187
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:31,660
它是基于符号人工智能的方法的混合

1188
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:34,900
 and also numerical AI-based approach.

1188
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:34,900
以及基于人工智能的数值方法。

1189
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:38,780
 Now we focus symbolic AI.

1189
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:38,780
现在我们关注符号人工智能。

1190
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:43,780
 Okay, so you can see this is not really mimic our brain.

1190
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:43,780
好吧，你可以看到这并不是真正模仿我们的大脑。

1191
01:24:45,299 --> 01:24:49,420
 Okay, so it's not mimic how our brain

1191
01:24:45,299 --> 01:24:49,420
好吧，所以它不是模仿我们的大脑

1192
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:51,620
 solve the problem from neural level.

1192
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:51,620
从神经层面解决问题。

1193
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:56,620
 So that is like data-driven and also like bottom-up.

1193
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:56,620
这就像数据驱动，也像自下而上。

1194
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:58,980
 Okay, we see bottom-up because we are looking

1194
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:58,980
好的，我们自下而上地看，因为我们正在寻找

1195
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:03,059
 into each cells to see how each cell process the data

1195
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:03,059
进入每个单元格以查看每个单元格如何处理数据

1196
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,740
 and then come out with a representation.

1196
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,740
然后拿出一个代表。

1197
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:09,740
 So it's like from very basic one data directly driven

1197
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:09,740
所以这就像从非常基本的一个数据直接驱动

1198
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:11,780
 and come with abstraction.

1198
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:11,780
并带有抽象。

1199
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,420
 Okay, representation, if you consider

1199
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,420
好吧，代表，如果你考虑一下

1200
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:17,180
 the network representation as a representation,

1200
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:17,180
网络表示作为表示，

1201
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,900
 then it's like from bottom to the top.

1201
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,900
然后就像从下到上一样。

1202
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:22,500
 Okay, so that is a neural network-based approach.

1202
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:22,500
好的，这是一种基于神经网络的方法。

1203
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,820
 Or we also call numerical AI.

1203
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,820
或者我们也称之为数值人工智能。

1204
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:28,380
 Numerical AI because it's all numbers like, okay.

1204
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:28,380
数字人工智能，因为它都是数字，好吧。

1205
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,940
 But symbolic AI, from the name you can tell, right?

1205
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,940
但是符号AI，从名字上就可以看出来，对吧？

1206
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:33,540
 It's a symbol-based.

1206
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:33,540
它是基于符号的。

1207
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:36,700
 So symbol-based, that means it's top-down.

1207
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:36,700
基于符号，这意味着它是自上而下的。

1208
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:40,740
 Top-down meaning we need to understand the problem first.

1208
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:40,740
自上而下意味着我们需要首先了解问题。

1209
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:45,540
 Okay, as a designer, we need to know the problem very well.

1209
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:45,540
好吧，作为设计师，我们需要非常了解这个问题。

1210
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,460
 And after that, we try to do abstraction.

1210
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,460
之后，我们尝试进行抽象。

1211
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,780
 Okay, we need to come out with the full understanding.

1211
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,780
好吧，我们需要充分理解。

1212
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:56,299
 Then we decide, okay, how to represent these things,

1212
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:56,299
然后我们决定如何表示这些东西，

1213
01:25:56,299 --> 01:26:01,099
 use symbols, and then computer can understand this symbol

1213
01:25:56,299 --> 01:26:01,099
使用符号，然后计算机可以理解这个符号

1214
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:04,380
 and then can understand how to process it.

1214
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:04,380
然后就可以了解如何处理它。

1215
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,740
 Okay, so that is a key idea.

1215
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,740
好的，这是一个关键想法。

1216
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:09,380
 So we need to come out with a representation,

1216
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:09,380
所以我们需要拿出一个代表，

1217
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:13,020
 use symbols, and then come out with a legal rule,

1217
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:13,020
使用符号，然后得出一个法律规则，

1218
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:18,020
 rules to governing the movement of the program.

1218
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:18,020
管理程序移动的规则。

1219
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:20,100
 Okay, then you write the code

1219
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:20,100
好吧，那你就写代码吧

1220
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,740
 to say how to manipulate the things.

1220
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,740
说出如何操纵事物。

1221
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:24,300
 So that is the idea.

1221
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:24,300
这就是我们的想法。

1222
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,900
 Okay, so probably still too abstract, huh?

1222
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,900
好吧，可能还是太抽象了，是吧？

1223
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:30,820
 So basically, we need to explicitly define the symbol

1223
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:30,820
所以基本上，我们需要明确定义符号

1224
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:34,740
 and then define the legal rules can be used.

1224
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:34,740
然后定义可以使用的法律规则。

1225
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,099
 So it's like a symbol for representation,

1225
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,099
所以它就像一个代表的符号，

1226
01:26:38,099 --> 01:26:41,340
 rules for manipulation, okay, or creation.

1226
01:26:38,099 --> 01:26:41,340
操纵、确定或创造的规则。

1227
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:46,540
 So use partial knowledge and derive further new knowledge

1227
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:46,540
因此，利用部分知识并推导出进一步的新知识

1228
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,019
 and from knowledge and then try to actually come out

1228
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,019
然后从知识中尝试实际出来

1229
01:26:49,019 --> 01:26:52,059
 with performance of the task.

1229
01:26:49,019 --> 01:26:52,059
与任务的执行情况。

1230
01:26:52,059 --> 01:26:53,660
 So that is the idea.

1230
01:26:52,059 --> 01:26:53,660
这就是我们的想法。

1231
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:58,460
 Okay, use chess as an example, play chess, okay, chess game.

1231
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:58,460
好吧，以国际象棋为例，下棋，好吧，棋局。

1232
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:02,060
 So what we do is we have the chess board, right,

1232
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:02,060
所以我们要做的是我们有棋盘，对吧，

1233
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,620
 and then we have pieces.

1233
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,620
然后我们就有了碎片。

1234
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:06,900
 We have those each pieces like some king, queen,

1234
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:06,900
我们每一件都有像国王、王后一样的东西，

1235
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,900
 you know, different things.

1235
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,900
你知道，不同的事情。

1236
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:13,340
 So we use the chess, the board to represent it.

1236
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:13,340
所以我们用国际象棋、棋盘来代表它。

1237
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:16,060
 Each board can be one state

1237
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:16,060
每个板可以是一种状态

1238
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:18,340
 and then each piece on the board,

1238
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:18,340
然后棋盘上的每一块，

1239
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:22,100
 the location is you use symbol to represent.

1239
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:22,100
位置是你用符号来表示的。

1240
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:26,100
 Okay, so if this symbol is king, we probably use K.

1240
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:26,100
好的，如果这个符号为王，我们可能会使用 K。

1241
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,300
 If it's queen, use Q, you know,

1241
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,300
如果是皇后，就用Q，你知道的，

1242
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:30,060
 whatever you like.

1242
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:30,060
无论你喜欢什么。

1243
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,500
 So use a symbol to represent the things

1243
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,500
所以用符号来代表事物

1244
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,660
 and then you use a data structure

1244
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,660
然后你使用数据结构

1245
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:36,260
 to represent the whole thing.

1245
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:36,260
来代表整个事物。

1246
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:39,660
 Okay, so this is representation, you see?

1246
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:39,660
好吧，这就是代表，你明白吗？

1247
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:42,140
 Very different from neural network approach, right?

1247
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:42,140
与神经网络方法非常不同，对吧？

1248
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:45,180
 Neural network approach, you don't have representation.

1248
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:45,180
神经网络方法，你没有代表性。

1249
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:47,060
 You don't have abstraction.

1249
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:47,060
你没有抽象能力。

1250
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:50,420
 You directly data, driven, you know, learn, learn, learn

1250
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:50,420
你直接数据，驱动，你知道，学习，学习，学习

1251
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,580
 and then come out with a vector representation.

1251
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,580
然后得出向量表示。

1252
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,380
 That is a representation.

1252
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,380
那是一种表象。

1253
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:56,140
 It's a numerical value, right?

1253
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:56,140
这是一个数值，对吗？

1254
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:57,660
 You cannot figure out what this,

1254
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:57,660
你无法弄清楚这是什么，

1255
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:00,460
 but yes, this is a representation.

1255
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:00,460
但是，是的，这是一种表现。

1256
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:02,540
 This one have meaning, okay?

1256
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:02,540
这个有意义吧？

1257
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:06,220
 So this symbol, each symbol means something to us

1257
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:06,220
所以这个符号，每个符号对我们来说都有意义

1258
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:08,139
 so can be explained it.

1258
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:08,139
所以可以解释一下。

1259
01:28:08,139 --> 01:28:10,059
 Okay, so symbol that is the one.

1259
01:28:08,139 --> 01:28:10,059
好的，这就是符号。

1260
01:28:10,059 --> 01:28:13,059
 Rule, yeah, talk about movements.

1260
01:28:10,059 --> 01:28:13,059
规则，是的，谈论动作。

1261
01:28:13,059 --> 01:28:17,660
 So for example, king can move from vertically,

1261
01:28:13,059 --> 01:28:17,660
例如，国王可以从垂直方向移动，

1262
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:21,180
 horizontally, diagonal, you can move as well.

1262
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:21,180
水平、对角线，你都可以移动。

1263
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:24,260
 You know, as long as nobody block you, you can move, right?

1263
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:24,260
你知道，只要没有人阻挡你，你就可以移动，对吗？

1264
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,940
 So that is a rule you can write.

1264
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,940
这就是你可以写的规则。

1265
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:30,940
 So for each piece, you can define the legal rules,

1265
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:30,940
所以对于每一件作品，你都可以定义法律规则，

1266
01:28:31,059 --> 01:28:33,379
 allowed movement, okay?

1266
01:28:31,059 --> 01:28:33,379
允许移动，好吗？

1267
01:28:33,379 --> 01:28:37,099
 So define this one by one, very much like an expert system.

1267
01:28:33,379 --> 01:28:37,099
所以一一定义这个，非常像专家系统。

1268
01:28:37,099 --> 01:28:40,980
 You know, experts need to have the representation.

1268
01:28:37,099 --> 01:28:40,980
要知道，专家需要有代表性。

1269
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:45,980
 Then state out clearly the legal rules one by one,

1269
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:45,980
然后把法律规则一一说清楚，

1270
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:49,339
 but you need to list out all the possible combinations.

1270
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:49,339
但你需要列出所有可能的组合。

1271
01:28:49,339 --> 01:28:51,419
 That's a serious part, okay?

1271
01:28:49,339 --> 01:28:51,419
这是一个严肃的部分，好吗？

1272
01:28:51,419 --> 01:28:53,660
 You need to do this out everything.

1272
01:28:51,419 --> 01:28:53,660
你需要把所有事情都做到这一点。

1273
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:57,099
 Then operation or manipulation.

1273
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:57,099
然后进行操作或操纵。

1274
01:28:57,099 --> 01:28:59,900
 Use symbol and the rules to make movement.

1274
01:28:57,099 --> 01:28:59,900
使用符号和规则进行运动。

1275
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:03,340
 So your code should be able to say, okay,

1275
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:03,340
所以你的代码应该能够说，好吧，

1276
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:07,300
 if this piece is a K, that means it's a king,

1276
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:07,300
如果这件棋子是K，那就意味着它是国王，

1277
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:10,820
 then you can look left, right, you know,

1277
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:10,820
然后你可以向左看，向右看，你知道，

1278
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:15,540
 forward, vertical in front, or in the same role,

1278
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:15,540
向前、垂直向前或以相同的角色，

1279
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:18,300
 or diagonal, both direction.

1279
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:18,300
或对角线，两个方向。

1280
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,260
 If that's no piece block there,

1280
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,260
如果那里没有一块块的话

1281
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:23,220
 you can move in that location.

1281
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:23,220
您可以移动到该位置。

1282
01:29:24,019 --> 01:29:27,540
 So something like this, you need to write everything.

1282
01:29:24,019 --> 01:29:27,540
所以像这样的事情，你需要写所有的东西。

1283
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:31,540
 Then depends on what position you are in now,

1283
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:31,540
然后就看你现在处于什么位置了

1284
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:34,380
 then you can decide where to move next.

1284
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:34,380
然后你就可以决定下一步搬到哪里。

1285
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:38,059
 That is symbolic AI, okay?

1285
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:38,059
这就是象征性人工智能，好吗？

1286
01:29:38,059 --> 01:29:39,860
 For game play, for game play.

1286
01:29:38,059 --> 01:29:39,860
为了玩游戏，为了玩游戏。

1287
01:29:41,099 --> 01:29:44,900
 Okay, so that's what we are going to talk.

1287
01:29:41,099 --> 01:29:44,900
好的，这就是我们要讨论的内容。

1288
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:46,620
 What is symbolic AI?

1288
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:46,620
什么是符号人工智能？

1289
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:50,059
 Why we have this so-called representation?

1289
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:50,059
为什么我们有这个所谓的代表？

1290
01:29:50,059 --> 01:29:52,300
 Why we have a state space?

1290
01:29:50,059 --> 01:29:52,300
为什么我们有一个状态空间？

1291
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,540
 We have a state space approach.

1291
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,540
我们有一个状态空间方法。

1292
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:58,540
 And why likely we have to use a graph representation?

1292
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:58,540
为什么我们必须使用图形表示？

1293
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:01,100
 And then why we have search?

1293
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:01,100
那我们为什么要进行搜索呢？

1294
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,340
 Okay, then search have two kind of search.

1294
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,340
好吧，那么搜索有两种搜索。

1295
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:06,980
 Exhausted search, that means if all the state

1295
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:06,980
穷尽搜索，这意味着如果所有状态

1296
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:10,780
 can be represented in memory, or in our computer,

1296
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:10,780
可以在内存中或在我们的计算机中表示，

1297
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:14,300
 then we should have a way, don't miss out any state.

1297
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:14,300
那我们就应该有办法，不要错过任何一个状态。

1298
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:19,300
 Okay, as long as I systematically search through the space,

1298
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:19,300
好吧，只要我系统地搜索一下空间，

1299
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:21,940
 I'm able to find the answer.

1299
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:21,940
我能够找到答案。

1300
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:24,660
 So that is exhausted search.

1300
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:24,660
这就是穷尽搜索。

1301
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:27,179
 Another one, much more efficient way,

1301
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:27,179
另一种更有效的方法，

1302
01:30:27,179 --> 01:30:29,259
 we should make use of the hints, right?

1302
01:30:27,179 --> 01:30:29,259
我们应该利用这些提示，对吗？

1303
01:30:29,259 --> 01:30:32,780
 Don't blindly search everything.

1303
01:30:29,259 --> 01:30:32,780
不要盲目地寻找一切。

1304
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:36,059
 You should follow certain pattern to make use of hints

1304
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:36,059
您应该遵循一定的模式来使用提示

1305
01:30:36,059 --> 01:30:37,900
 to search for answer.

1305
01:30:36,059 --> 01:30:37,900
来寻找答案。

1306
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,980
 Okay, so this is the type of search.

1306
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,980
好的，这就是搜索的类型。

1307
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:42,339
 That's what we are going to discuss.

1307
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:42,339
这就是我们要讨论的内容。

1308
01:30:42,339 --> 01:30:45,419
 Okay, so you can see here, yeah, so symbolic AI,

1308
01:30:42,339 --> 01:30:45,419
好的，所以你可以在这里看到，是的，如此具有象征意义的人工智能，

1309
01:30:45,419 --> 01:30:48,379
 then you have the states, and then you have

1309
01:30:45,419 --> 01:30:48,379
然后你有州，然后你有

1310
01:30:48,379 --> 01:30:51,500
 inference rules, the rules, and then you have the space.

1310
01:30:48,379 --> 01:30:51,500
推理规则，规则，然后你就有了空间。

1311
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:56,500
 Each state consists of the, I mean, define the whole space.

1311
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:56,500
我的意思是，每个状态都由定义整个空间组成。

1312
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,820
 Okay, so for knowledge representation,

1312
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,820
好的，对于知识表示，

1313
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:02,900
 actually, yeah, those logic ones.

1313
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:02,900
事实上，是的，那些逻辑。

1314
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:07,500
 So you can use very much the logic representation.

1314
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:07,500
所以你可以非常多地使用逻辑表示。

1315
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,100
 You use the predicate calculus,

1315
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,100
您使用谓词演算，

1316
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:13,540
 or you use the proportional, proposition calculus,

1316
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:13,540
或者你使用比例命题演算，

1317
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:15,860
 but that is likely not.

1317
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:15,860
但事实可能并非如此。

1318
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:17,900
 But those are first-order logic.

1318
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:17,900
但这些都是一阶逻辑。

1319
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:20,019
 Okay, the neural network I put here,

1319
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:20,019
好吧，我放在这里的神经网络，

1320
01:31:20,019 --> 01:31:24,540
 because in general, this is the possible representation.

1320
01:31:20,019 --> 01:31:24,540
因为一般来说，这是可能的表示。

1321
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:29,540
 Okay, then data structure, yeah, likely the graph and trees.

1321
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:29,540
好吧，然后是数据结构，是的，可能是图和树。

1322
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:32,780
 And then we talk about the specific problem

1322
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:32,780
然后我们再谈谈具体问题

1323
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:36,620
 to see why it's good to have a graph representation,

1323
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:36,620
看看为什么用图形表示是好的，

1324
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:39,500
 okay, because that's a theory behind can support us.

1324
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:39,500
好吧，因为这背后有一个理论可以支持我们。

1325
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:42,059
 And then why state space graph,

1325
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:42,059
那么为什么状态空间图，

1326
01:31:42,059 --> 01:31:45,219
 and then something related to the graph terminologies.

1326
01:31:42,059 --> 01:31:45,219
然后是与图形术语相关的内容。

1327
01:31:45,219 --> 01:31:47,179
 I think you all learned this before, right?

1327
01:31:45,219 --> 01:31:47,179
我想你们都已经学过这个了，对吧？

1328
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:50,340
 I think you all learned discrete math before, right?

1328
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:50,340
我想你们以前都学过离散数学，对吧？

1329
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:51,300
 In undergrad.

1329
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:51,300
在读本科生。

1330
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:56,220
 So yeah, this slide I keep, but I'm not going through,

1330
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:56,220
是的，这张幻灯片我保留着，但我不会浏览，

1331
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,020
 so you should be able to take a look.

1331
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,020
所以你应该可以看一下。

1332
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,100
 And then the state space approach,

1332
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,100
然后是状态空间方法，

1333
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,940
 like we show you the example, using TikTok poll,

1333
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,940
就像我们向您展示的示例一样，使用 TikTok 民意调查，

1334
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:08,060
 use eight puzzle or 15 puzzle.

1334
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:08,060
使用 8 个拼图或 15 个拼图。

1335
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:10,940
 We also use a travel salesman problem.

1335
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:10,940
我们还使用旅行推销员问题。

1336
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:15,700
 And then search strategy, so data-driven or goal-driven.

1336
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:15,700
然后是搜索策略，即数据驱动或目标驱动。

1337
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,580
 Forward or backwards.

1337
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,580
向前或向后。

1338
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:20,700
 And then we were going to cover this

1338
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:20,700
然后我们要介绍这个

1339
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,300
 in our next week lecture.

1339
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,300
在我们下周的讲座中。

1340
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,860
 Okay, so today we need to finish all the way here.

1340
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,860
好吧，今天我们就得把这里说完。

1341
01:32:26,179 --> 01:32:27,019
 Okay.

1341
01:32:26,179 --> 01:32:27,019
好的。

1342
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:34,900
 Yeah, okay, because one of our key textbook is Luger's book.

1342
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:34,900
是的，好吧，因为我们的主要教科书之一是 Luger 的书。

1343
01:32:35,099 --> 01:32:38,860
 So that is a very, very influential textbook

1343
01:32:35,099 --> 01:32:38,860
所以这是一本非常非常有影响力的教科书

1344
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:42,460
 in symbolic AI, okay, so that is our textbook.

1344
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:42,460
在符号人工智能中，好吧，这就是我们的教科书。

1345
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:45,740
 So this is how he define introduction, okay?

1345
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:45,740
这就是他定义介绍的方式，好吗？

1346
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:50,220
 He said two most fundamental concern of AI researcher

1346
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:50,220
他表示AI研究者最根本的两个担忧

1347
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:52,940
 is how to represent the things, okay?

1347
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:52,940
就是如何表示事物，好吗？

1348
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:55,020
 Then secondly, how to search,

1348
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:55,020
然后第二个，如何搜索，

1349
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:57,740
 how to have a problem-solving techniques.

1349
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:57,740
如何拥有解决问题的技巧。

1350
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:00,940
 So the representation, that means actually

1350
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:00,940
所以这个表示实际上意味着

1351
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:05,220
 we can capture the knowledge, okay, in a language.

1351
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:05,220
我们可以用一种语言来捕捉知识。

1352
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:08,540
 So this is how to, using the language

1352
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:08,540
这就是如何使用语言

1353
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:11,180
 which computer can understand, okay?

1353
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:11,180
哪台电脑能看懂啊？

1354
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:13,500
 We need to actually represent it.

1354
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:13,500
我们需要实际代表它。

1355
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,500
 Computer can understand, human can understand,

1355
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,500
计算机可以理解，人类也可以理解，

1356
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:17,580
 we need to do that.

1356
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:17,580
我们需要这样做。

1357
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:19,580
 So capture knowledge in a way,

1357
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:19,580
所以以某种方式捕捉知识，

1358
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:22,620
 and computer can understand, computer can manipulate,

1358
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:22,620
计算机可以理解，计算机可以操纵，

1359
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:24,500
 computer can operate on.

1359
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:24,500
电脑可以操作。

1360
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,100
 Okay, so that is the one.

1360
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,100
好吧，那就是这个了。

1361
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:30,500
 Then search is to systematically or with a hint

1361
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:30,500
那么搜索就是系统的或者有提示的

1362
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:33,980
 to explore the whole problem space, okay?

1362
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:33,980
探索整个问题空间，好吗？

1363
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:37,580
 So this is the two most, I mean,

1363
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:37,580
所以这是两个最重要的，我的意思是，

1364
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:40,220
 if you can get these two done, that's it, right?

1364
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:40,220
如果你能完成这两件事，就可以了，对吗？

1365
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:41,580
 Problem solved.

1365
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:41,580
问题解决了。

1366
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,300
 Yeah, so this is what we are talking about,

1366
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,300
是的，这就是我们正在谈论的，

1367
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,340
 space representation.

1367
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,340
空间表示。

1368
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:47,420
 Now, define all the possible states,

1368
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:47,420
现在，定义所有可能的状态，

1369
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:50,460
 and then you see how to move from one state to another.

1369
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:50,460
然后你就会看到如何从一种状态转移到另一种状态。

1370
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:53,620
 Okay, so this is use a model to differentiate,

1370
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:53,620
好的，所以这是用一个模型来区分，

1371
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:56,100
 configure it, and then find possible paths.

1371
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:56,100
配置它，然后找到可能的路径。

1372
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:59,140
 Okay, let's take a look at this example.

1372
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:59,140
好吧，让我们看一下这个例子。

1373
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:02,060
 This is a eight-puzzle problem.

1373
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:02,060
这是一道八题。

1374
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:05,100
 Okay, so eight-puzzle, that means we have eight

1374
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:05,100
好的，所以八谜题，这意味着我们有八个

1375
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:07,420
 numbered tiles, okay?

1375
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:07,420
编号的瓷砖，好吗？

1376
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:11,820
 So one from one to eight, plus one empty tile, okay?

1376
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:11,820
所以从一到八，再加上一块空瓷砖，好吗？

1377
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,060
 So that is in blue.

1377
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,060
所以这是蓝色的。

1378
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:17,220
 So suppose this is our starting state, okay?

1378
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:17,220
假设这是我们的起始状态，好吗？

1379
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,100
 Our starting state from here.

1379
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,100
我们的起始状态从这里开始。

1380
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,660
 And this is our goal.

1380
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,660
这就是我们的目标。

1381
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:21,780
 We want to achieve this.

1381
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:21,780
我们希望实现这一目标。

1382
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:25,020
 We want the tiles to be arranged in this way.

1382
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:25,020
我们希望瓷砖以这种方式排列。

1383
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,820
 One, two, three, second row, four, five, six, seven, eight,

1383
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,820
一、二、三、第二排、四、五、六、七、八、

1384
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:30,860
 and then the blue tile is here.

1384
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:30,860
然后蓝色瓷砖就在这里。

1385
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:33,980
 Okay, sorry, and this is the,

1385
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:33,980
好吧，抱歉，这是，

1386
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:35,660
 in textbook they don't have the goal state,

1386
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:35,660
在教科书中他们没有目标状态，

1387
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:37,060
 but I feel it's good to have it,

1387
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:37,060
但我觉得拥有它很好

1388
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:39,140
 I forgot coloring it.

1388
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:39,140
我忘记给它上色了。

1389
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:43,300
 Okay, so this is suppose it's a blue color, okay?

1389
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:43,300
好吧，假设它是蓝色的，好吗？

1390
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:45,140
 The empty tower.

1390
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:45,140
空塔。

1391
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:47,500
 Okay, so suppose this is our goal state.

1391
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:47,500
好的，假设这是我们的目标状态。

1392
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:53,300
 Okay, then for symbolic EI, how are we going to write it?

1392
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:53,300
好吧，那么对于符号EI，我们要怎么写呢？

1393
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:55,660
 Okay, so you need to use symbol to represent, right?

1393
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:55,660
好吧，所以需要用符号来表示，对吗？

1394
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:59,100
 So symbol to represent one and the position,

1394
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:59,100
所以符号代表一和位置，

1395
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,540
 and then we define the rules.

1395
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,540
然后我们定义规则。

1396
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:03,580
 So what is the legal rule moment?

1396
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:03,580
那么什么是法律规则时刻呢？

1397
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:07,100
 Okay, we only move the blue tower.

1397
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:07,100
好吧，我们只移动蓝塔。

1398
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:12,100
 Okay, so blue tower, yeah, you can move up or down

1398
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:12,100
好的，所以蓝塔，是的，你可以向上或向下移动

1399
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:15,860
 or left or right, okay, if possible.

1399
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:15,860
或左或右，好吧，如果可能的话。

1400
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:18,019
 Not out of the board, okay?

1400
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:18,019
没出局吧？

1401
01:35:18,019 --> 01:35:19,620
 So this is the rule.

1401
01:35:18,019 --> 01:35:19,620
所以这就是规则。

1402
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:23,660
 So for this case, yeah, if you move to the left,

1402
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:23,660
所以对于这种情况，是的，如果你向左移动，

1403
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:28,180
 then move to the left, exchange with the number seven, right?

1403
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:28,180
然后向左移动，与数字七交换，对吗？

1404
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:31,820
 Yeah, if you move to the up, then exchange with number four.

1404
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:31,820
是的，如果你向上移动，那么就与第四名交换。

1405
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:35,700
 That's how, only these four options, right?

1405
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:35,700
怎么样，只有这四个选项吧？

1406
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:38,099
 Yeah, then after each of these, then you can decide.

1406
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:38,099
是的，然后在每一个之后，你就可以决定了。

1407
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:42,700
 Okay, so for this one, up, move up will be out, so cannot.

1407
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:42,700
好的，所以对于这个，向上，向上移动将被淘汰，所以不能。

1408
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:45,019
 Can move down, move down to where?

1408
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:45,019
可以下移，下移到哪里？

1409
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,059
 Previous one, right?

1409
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,059
上一张，对吧？

1410
01:35:51,059 --> 01:35:52,740
 Yes, it form a loop.

1410
01:35:51,059 --> 01:35:52,740
是的，它形成了一个循环。

1411
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:56,700
 So if you don't allow the loop, then you don't take it.

1411
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:56,700
因此，如果您不允许循环，那么您就不会接受它。

1412
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:01,139
 Okay, although actually it's a legal movement, right?

1412
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:01,139
好吧，虽然实际上这是一个合法的运动，对吧？

1413
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:04,300
 But then, suppose we don't want to loop back.

1413
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:04,300
但是，假设我们不想循环回来。

1414
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:09,300
 So then we have this, can only go left and right.

1414
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:09,300
那么接下来我们就这个了，只能左走右走。

1415
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:14,020
 So this is how you, so you can have every step.

1415
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:14,020
所以这就是你的样子，这样你就可以走好每一步。

1416
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:17,980
 So that is, each of these is a legal state.

1416
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:17,980
也就是说，每一个都是一个合法的状态。

1417
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:21,620
 And then the whole thing, we haven't finished yet.

1417
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:21,620
然后整个事情我们还没有完成。

1418
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:25,780
 The whole thing will form the state space, okay?

1418
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:25,780
整个事物将形成状态空间，好吗？

1419
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:27,340
 State space.

1419
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:27,340
状态空间。

1420
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:31,940
 And then, definitely one of it will be something like this.

1420
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:31,940
然后，其中肯定会有这样的事情。

1421
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,700
 The goal state, okay?

1421
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,700
目标状态，好吗？

1422
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:38,780
 So basically the problem solving become, we start from here.

1422
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:38,780
所以基本上解决问题就变成了，我们从这里开始。

1423
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:40,700
 And then we need to search, search, search,

1423
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:40,700
然后我们需要搜索，搜索，搜索，

1424
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:42,540
 search to find this.

1424
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:42,540
搜索找到这个。

1425
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:47,900
 Okay, so how to search to find the answer?

1425
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:47,900
好的，那么如何搜索才能找到答案呢？

1426
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,780
 Can do systematic search.

1426
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,780
可以进行系统搜索。

1427
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:53,940
 That means every state search, right?

1427
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:53,940
这意味着每个州的搜索，对吗？

1428
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:56,540
 Then find the match, okay, got it.

1428
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:56,540
然后找到匹配的，好吧，明白了。

1429
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:58,860
 But it's very efficient, right?

1429
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:58,860
但这非常有效，对吧？

1430
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:03,220
 But can, if the state, if the states can, I mean,

1430
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:03,220
但是，如果国家可以，如果国家可以，我的意思是，

1431
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:06,260
 state space is big enough and our computer can hold it.

1431
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:06,260
状态空间足够大，我们的计算机可以容纳它。

1432
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:09,780
 And we have enough time, take ages to find it,

1432
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:09,780
我们有足够的时间，需要很长时间才能找到它，

1433
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:13,060
 you don't mind, then yes, okay, can.

1433
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:13,060
你不介意的话，可以，可以。

1434
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,380
 But normally that is not the case, right?

1434
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,380
但通常情况并非如此，对吗？

1435
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:17,540
 Yeah, so you need to have a strategy

1435
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:17,540
是的，所以你需要制定一个策略

1436
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:20,620
 to find the answer quickly, okay, more effectively.

1436
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:20,620
快速找到答案，好吧，更有效。

1437
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:25,019
 So that is how to design a hint to find it, okay?

1437
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:25,019
这就是如何设计一个找到它的提示，好吗？

1438
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:26,900
 So this is what we have.

1438
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:26,900
这就是我们所拥有的。

1439
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:29,620
 And so things related to the search,

1439
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:29,620
与搜索相关的事情，

1440
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:32,060
 that's why we say why is it exhaustive search, okay?

1440
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:32,060
这就是为什么我们说为什么要穷举搜索，好吗？

1441
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:35,340
 You search, search, search, but systematically, okay?

1441
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:35,340
你搜索、搜索、搜索，但要系统地搜索，好吗？

1442
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:36,860
 Don't miss out anything.

1442
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:36,860
不要错过任何事情。

1443
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:40,300
 If the answer is there, you should be able to find it,

1443
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:40,300
如果答案在那里，你应该能够找到它，

1444
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,540
 given enough time and space.

1444
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,540
给予足够的时间和空间。

1445
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:46,140
 Okay, another thing is actually you do have a hint,

1445
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:46,140
好吧，另一件事实际上你确实有一个提示，

1446
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:48,580
 how to make use of the hint to find it.

1446
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:48,580
如何利用提示找到它。

1447
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:50,740
 Okay, so why the systematic search?

1447
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:50,740
好的，那么为什么要进行系统搜索呢？

1448
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:54,540
 Another one is heuristic-based search, okay?

1448
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:54,540
另一种是基于启发式的搜索，好吗？

1449
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,380
 So is this a legal state?

1449
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,380
那么这是一个合法的国家吗？

1450
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:02,660
 Why?

1450
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:02,660
为什么？

1451
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:08,020
 Yeah, it's not, right?

1451
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:08,020
是啊，不是吗？

1452
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:11,500
 So every state must be legal state.

1452
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:11,500
所以每个国家都必须是合法国家。

1453
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:16,180
 And then also every movement must be a legal movement, okay?

1453
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:16,180
而且每一个运动都必须是合法的运动，好吗？

1454
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:19,060
 Then you form this graph,

1454
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:19,060
然后你形成这个图表，

1455
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:23,940
 it's called the whole entire state space, okay?

1455
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:23,940
它被称为整个状态空间，好吗？

1456
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,940
 Yeah, anything else I need to say?

1456
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,940
是啊，我还有什么需要说的吗？

1457
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:27,460
 Yeah, I think it's about it.

1457
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:27,460
是的，我想就是这样。

1458
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:29,900
 Okay, so this is a toy problem really, okay?

1458
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:29,900
好吧，这确实是一个玩具问题，好吗？

1459
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:34,019
 Eight puzzles, it's not that many states, okay?

1459
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:34,019
八个谜题，没那么多状态吧？

1460
01:38:34,019 --> 01:38:37,259
 So this is another one, like a car diagnosis.

1460
01:38:34,019 --> 01:38:37,259
这是另一种情况，就像汽车诊断一样。

1461
01:38:37,259 --> 01:38:39,820
 Yeah, we're probably starting, where's the problem?

1461
01:38:37,259 --> 01:38:39,820
是的，我们可能正在开始，问题出在哪里？

1462
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:41,299
 Okay, so suppose engine stopped,

1462
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:41,299
好吧，假设发动机停止了，

1463
01:38:41,299 --> 01:38:44,500
 so we don't know what's the problem.

1463
01:38:41,299 --> 01:38:44,500
所以我们不知道问题出在哪里。

1464
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,299
 So we're starting from this state,

1464
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,299
所以我们从这个状态开始，

1465
01:38:46,299 --> 01:38:48,540
 and then we start to troubleshooting.

1465
01:38:46,299 --> 01:38:48,540
然后我们开始排除故障。

1466
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:50,900
 So to see engine trouble,

1466
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:50,900
所以要查看发动机故障，

1467
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:54,660
 we need to see the engine can start or not.

1467
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:54,660
我们需要看看发动机能否启动。

1468
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,420
 Yeah, it can start, then you ask something else.

1468
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,420
是的，它可以开始，然后你再问别的。

1469
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:59,420
 It cannot start, then you ask whether it's turned over,

1469
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:59,420
启动不了，然后你问是否翻了，

1470
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:00,420
 blah, blah, blah, blah.

1470
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:00,420
巴拉，巴拉，巴拉，巴拉。

1471
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:05,420
 So this is checking the problem solving as well.

1471
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:05,420
所以这也是在检查问题的解决情况。

1472
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:08,820
 So each state is one of the possible states.

1472
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:08,820
所以每个状态都是可能的状态之一。

1473
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:10,700
 And then you also want to find the answer

1473
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:10,700
然后你也想找到答案

1474
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:13,379
 from this search space.

1474
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:13,379
从这个搜索空间。

1475
01:39:13,379 --> 01:39:18,019
 Okay, so you can see for symbolic AI,

1475
01:39:13,379 --> 01:39:18,019
好的，你可以看到符号人工智能，

1476
01:39:18,019 --> 01:39:19,780
 we need to define the symbol,

1476
01:39:18,019 --> 01:39:19,780
我们需要定义符号，

1477
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:23,540
 we need to define the space, state, state,

1477
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:23,540
我们需要定义空间，状态，状态，

1478
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:26,519
 and then we have the state space,

1478
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:26,519
然后我们有状态空间，

1479
01:39:26,519 --> 01:39:31,179
 and then we should have initial knowledge or initial state,

1479
01:39:26,519 --> 01:39:31,179
然后我们应该有初始知识或初始状态，

1480
01:39:31,179 --> 01:39:34,820
 and we should have inference or the rules can be applied.

1480
01:39:31,179 --> 01:39:34,820
我们应该有推理，否则可以应用规则。

1481
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:37,860
 We should know how to define a move

1481
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:37,860
我们应该知道如何定义一个动作

1482
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:40,460
 from one place to another, right?

1482
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:40,460
从一个地方到另一个地方，对吗？

1483
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:42,179
 So that's why the state space

1483
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:42,179
这就是状态空间的原因

1484
01:39:42,179 --> 01:39:44,219
 is a collection of the problem states.

1484
01:39:42,179 --> 01:39:44,219
是问题状态的集合。

1485
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:49,099
 And the inference rule is how to apply the movement

1485
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:49,099
而推理规则就是如何应用运动

1486
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:51,940
 from initial states to the others.

1486
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:51,940
从初始状态到其他状态。

1487
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:56,940
 Okay, so basically we have representation,

1487
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:56,940
好的，基本上我们有代表，

1488
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,800
 we must have the operation rules,

1488
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,800
我们必须有操作规则，

1489
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:02,340
 and also we need to how to manipulate,

1489
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:02,340
我们还需要如何操纵，

1490
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:04,020
 how to move around.

1490
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:04,020
如何走动。

1491
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:05,580
 That's a key thing.

1491
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:05,580
这是一个关键的事情。

1492
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:08,820
 So yeah, I think this is also a good one.

1492
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:08,820
所以是的，我认为这也是一件好事。

1493
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:11,580
 So to say the problem in the beginning

1493
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:11,580
所以说一开始的问题

1494
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:12,860
 is we have this problem.

1494
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:12,860
是我们有这个问题。

1495
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:15,860
 So for example, we want to solve the A puzzle problem,

1495
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:15,860
例如，我们要解决 A 难题，

1496
01:40:16,179 --> 01:40:19,660
 we want to solve the TikTok problem or whatever.

1496
01:40:16,179 --> 01:40:19,660
我们想解决 TikTok 问题或其他问题。

1497
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:21,980
 And then we come up with abstraction, right?

1497
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:21,980
然后我们提出抽象，对吗？

1498
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:25,179
 So that is define the state and the state space,

1498
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:25,179
这就是定义状态和状态空间，

1499
01:40:25,179 --> 01:40:26,940
 and then define the movement.

1499
01:40:25,179 --> 01:40:26,940
然后定义运动。

1500
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:29,019
 So that is a rules operation.

1500
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:29,019
所以这是一个规则操作。

1501
01:40:29,019 --> 01:40:32,860
 And then we need to specify what is our starting state,

1501
01:40:29,019 --> 01:40:32,860
然后我们需要指定我们的起始状态是什么，

1502
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,620
 what is our goal, okay?

1502
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,620
我们的目标是什么，好吗？

1503
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:37,480
 So which goal you want to achieve, okay?

1503
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:37,480
那么你想实现哪个目标，好吗？

1504
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,420
 And then we start to process.

1504
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,420
然后我们开始处理。

1505
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,139
 So you can apply the search algorithm

1505
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,139
所以你可以应用搜索算法

1506
01:40:41,139 --> 01:40:44,639
 to find the path from the starting to the goal state.

1506
01:40:41,139 --> 01:40:44,639
找到从起始状态到目标状态的路径。

1507
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:50,640
 Okay, very clear, very clear about how the symbolic AI

1507
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:50,640
好的，非常清楚，非常清楚如何符号化AI

1508
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,640
 try to solve things.

1508
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,640
尝试解决问题。

1509
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:56,080
 Okay, so first thing is a large representation, right?

1509
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:56,080
好的，首先要做的就是要有一个大的代表性，对吧？

1510
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:59,060
 Yeah, in symbolic AI, just now I show you,

1510
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:59,060
是的，在符号人工智能中，刚才我向你展示，

1511
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:01,620
 for example, use a symbol to represent it,

1511
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:01,620
例如，用一个符号来表示它，

1512
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:04,240
 and then form the state and then move around.

1512
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:04,240
然后形成国家，然后四处走动。

1513
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:07,160
 But actually others, that is actually a graph, right?

1513
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:07,160
但实际上其他人，那实际上是一个图表，对吗？

1514
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,920
 The state space is a graph.

1514
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,920
状态空间是一个图。

1515
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:13,560
 But other methods, like you can use like a predicate calculus.

1515
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:13,560
但其他方法，比如你可以使用谓词演算。

1516
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,800
 So this is a formal language, very, very powerful

1516
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,800
所以这是一种正式语言，非常非常强大

1517
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,880
 for logic reasoning, right?

1517
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,880
为了逻辑推理，对吗？

1518
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,360
 Yeah, so can use this to do that.

1518
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,360
是的，所以可以用这个来做到这一点。

1519
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:26,400
 That is actually take a lot of space

1519
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:26,400
这实际上占用了很多空间

1520
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,680
 for the Ruger's book, early stage, okay?

1520
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,680
对于鲁格的书，早期阶段，好吗？

1521
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,960
 Because we have Prologue, we have Lisp,

1521
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,960
因为我们有Prologue，我们有Lisp，

1522
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,360
 can support that, and they're very easy to describe

1522
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,360
可以支持这一点，而且它们很容易描述

1523
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:37,760
 the things using the predicate calculus

1523
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:37,760
使用谓词演算的事物

1524
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:42,400
 and define the predicates and define the variables

1524
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:42,400
并定义谓词并定义变量

1525
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:46,080
 and define the quantifiers, and then just use this

1525
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:46,080
并定义量词，然后使用它

1526
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,599
 for reasoning purpose, okay?

1526
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,599
为了推理的目的，好吗？

1527
01:41:47,599 --> 01:41:50,559
 So you don't need a graph, you don't need a graph to search.

1527
01:41:47,599 --> 01:41:50,559
所以你不需要图表，你不需要图表来搜索。

1528
01:41:50,559 --> 01:41:54,759
 Basically, you just use a logic, the formal logic

1528
01:41:50,559 --> 01:41:54,759
基本上，你只需使用一种逻辑，形式逻辑

1529
01:41:54,759 --> 01:41:57,440
 to do the inference and the reasoning, okay?

1529
01:41:54,759 --> 01:41:57,440
进行推理和推理，好吗？

1530
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,440
 Also programming, very easy.

1530
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,440
还可以编程，非常简单。

1531
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:02,519
 The Prologue and Lisp is designed for that, okay?

1531
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:02,519
Prologue 和 Lisp 就是为此而设计的，好吗？

1532
01:42:02,519 --> 01:42:06,639
 That's why early symbolic AI is very much on that,

1532
01:42:02,519 --> 01:42:06,639
这就是为什么早期的符号人工智能非常重视这一点，

1533
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:08,519
 very much, okay?

1533
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:08,519
非常喜欢，好吗？

1534
01:42:08,519 --> 01:42:11,320
 That's why I mention this, but this is just purely

1534
01:42:08,519 --> 01:42:11,320
这就是为什么我提到这一点，但这纯粹是

1535
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:13,000
 for your knowledge, purely for,

1535
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:13,000
为了您的知识，纯粹为了，

1536
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,040
 I'm not going to test you on this at all, okay?

1536
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,040
我根本不会在这方面考验你，好吗？

1537
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:17,000
 That's a good thing.

1537
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:17,000
这是一件好事。

1538
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:21,160
 So here is just an example, for example, you want to say,

1538
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:21,160
所以这里只是一个例子，比如你想说，

1539
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:25,519
 you want to find out, you know, all cats has tails,

1539
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:25,519
你想知道，你知道，所有的猫都有尾巴，

1540
01:42:25,519 --> 01:42:28,200
 and then you know Tom is a cat,

1540
01:42:25,519 --> 01:42:28,200
然后你就知道汤姆是一只猫

1541
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:31,440
 and then we know that Tom has tail, okay?

1541
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:31,440
然后我们就知道汤姆有尾巴了，好吗？

1542
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:35,000
 So you can use a predicate calculus to represent like this,

1542
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:35,000
所以你可以使用谓词演算来表示，

1543
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,440
 okay, and so you don't need to have a graph.

1543
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,440
好的，所以您不需要图表。

1544
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,839
 So you can see this, how easy to communicate

1544
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,839
所以你可以看到，沟通是多么容易

1545
01:42:40,839 --> 01:42:45,559
 with the computer, especially the language,

1545
01:42:40,839 --> 01:42:45,559
与计算机，尤其是语言，

1546
01:42:45,559 --> 01:42:47,040
 specially designed for this.

1546
01:42:45,559 --> 01:42:47,040
专门为此设计的。

1547
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:49,879
 Okay, how about this?

1547
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:49,879
好吧，这个怎么样？

1548
01:42:51,879 --> 01:42:56,559
 So this is an example, also quite fun.

1548
01:42:51,879 --> 01:42:56,559
这是一个例子，也很有趣。

1549
01:42:56,559 --> 01:42:58,679
 Okay, so suppose there's a farmer here,

1549
01:42:56,559 --> 01:42:58,679
好吧 假设这里有一个农民

1550
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:01,519
 and then he has three possessions.

1550
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:01,519
然后他拥有三件财产。

1551
01:43:01,519 --> 01:43:06,519
 One is a fork, one is a chick, one is a sack of grains, okay?

1551
01:43:01,519 --> 01:43:06,519
一个是叉子，一个是小鸡，一个是一袋谷物，好吗？

1552
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:10,560
 So he has a boat, so now he need to move

1552
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:10,560
所以他有一艘船，所以现在他需要移动

1553
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:15,560
 from left of the left of the river bank to the right, okay?

1553
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:15,560
从河岸的左边到右边，好吗？

1554
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,120
 So what are the constraints here?

1554
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,120
那么这里有什么限制呢？

1555
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:21,920
 He cannot leave the chick with the grain,

1555
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:21,920
他不能把谷物留给小鸡，

1556
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,480
 because they will eat it, okay?

1556
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,480
因为他们会吃它，好吗？

1557
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:28,400
 He cannot leave the fork with the chick alone, right?

1557
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:28,400
他不能把叉子和小鸡单独留在一起，对吗？

1558
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,120
 Because forks will eat the chick.

1558
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,120
因为叉子会吃掉小鸡。

1559
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,560
 And anything else?

1559
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,560
还有其他什么吗？

1560
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:36,400
 Is that safe to leave the fork with the grain?

1560
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:36,400
把叉子和谷物一起留下安全吗？

1561
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,080
 The fork won't eat it.

1561
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,080
叉子不会吃它。

1562
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:42,080
 Okay, so you need to define, okay,

1562
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:42,080
好吧，所以你需要定义，好吧，

1563
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:46,920
 what are the possible rules for the movement?

1563
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:46,920
运动可能的规则是什么？

1564
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,759
 And how are we going to represent it?

1564
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,759
我们将如何表示它？

1565
01:43:50,599 --> 01:43:54,400
 So suppose we, yeah, the states actually can represent

1565
01:43:50,599 --> 01:43:54,400
所以假设我们，是的，各州实际上可以代表

1566
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:59,360
 in this form, left river bank, right bank, okay?

1566
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:59,360
就这样，左岸，右岸，好吗？

1567
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,879
 So that is items, so it can be a list of things

1567
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,879
这就是项目，所以它可以是事物的列表

1568
01:44:02,879 --> 01:44:04,879
 on the left bank of the river,

1568
01:44:02,879 --> 01:44:04,879
在河的左岸，

1569
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,240
 and items on the right bank of the river.

1569
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,240
以及河流右岸的物品。

1570
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,720
 So then you can, for each of these,

1570
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,720
那么你可以，对于每一个，

1571
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,480
 you can actually have, you know,

1571
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,480
你实际上可以拥有，你知道，

1572
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:17,480
 probably C to stand for chick, and F stand for fork,

1572
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:17,480
可能 C 代表小鸡，F 代表叉子，

1573
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:20,280
 grain, farmer, you know?

1573
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:20,280
粮食，农民，你知道吗？

1574
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:23,080
 Every time you can only bring one item with you,

1574
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:23,080
每次只能携带一件物品，

1575
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:25,720
 or you can don't bring anything else, okay?

1575
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:25,720
不然你就不能带别的东西了，好吗？

1576
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:27,840
 Okay, so then you need to specify,

1576
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:27,840
好的，那么你需要指定，

1577
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,120
 what's the initial state, right?

1577
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,120
初始状态是什么，对吗？

1578
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:33,600
 So initially, suppose we assume everybody

1578
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:33,600
所以最初，假设我们假设每个人

1579
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:37,840
 on the left side of the river, okay, left bank.

1579
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:37,840
在河的左边，好吧，左岸。

1580
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:41,760
 So that's why those items, everything on the left,

1580
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:41,760
这就是为什么这些项目，左边的所有东西，

1581
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:45,120
 and right is nothing, okay?

1581
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:45,120
而对的就什么都不是了，好吗？

1582
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:49,560
 And then in the end, goal state is nothing on the left,

1582
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:49,560
最后，目标状态左边什么都没有，

1583
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:52,880
 now everything on the right, okay?

1583
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:52,880
现在一切都在右边，好吗？

1584
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,240
 So one possible state, is this okay?

1584
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,240
那么一种可能的状态，这样可以吗？

1585
01:44:56,640 --> 01:45:01,640
 The fork with the grain, and farmer with chick, can?

1585
01:44:56,640 --> 01:45:01,640
叉子带着谷物，农夫带着小鸡，可以吗？

1586
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:04,080
 Can, yeah, can.

1586
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:04,080
可以，可以，可以。

1587
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:08,520
 So we can represent this, okay?

1587
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:08,520
所以我们可以代表这个，好吗？

1588
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:11,800
 So like, we can have a starting state like this,

1588
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:11,800
就像，我们可以有这样的起始状态，

1589
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,040
 and then we can have a goal state like this,

1589
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,040
然后我们可以有这样的目标状态，

1590
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,800
 and then we can have movement,

1590
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,800
然后我们就可以进行运动，

1591
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:18,520
 and then we can draw the space, okay?

1591
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:18,520
然后我们就可以绘制空间了，好吗？

1592
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,960
 And then you can see what is the best way to find the answer.

1592
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,960
然后您就可以看到找到答案的最佳方法是什么。

1593
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,240
 Okay, so that is the problem solving,

1593
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,240
好了，问题就这样解决了

1594
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:29,480
 to see how to move from the left to the right.

1594
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:29,480
查看如何从左向右移动。

1595
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:34,280
 Yeah, so for example, we can say,

1595
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:34,280
是的，例如，我们可以说，

1596
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:37,160
 so take the grain with you, so is this okay?

1596
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:37,160
所以随身携带谷物，这样可以吗？

1597
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:42,000
 The farm take the grain, and then another side

1597
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:42,000
农场拿走粮食，然后再到另一边

1598
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:47,000
 is left the chicken with the farm, or fox, cannot, right?

1598
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:47,000
是把鸡留在农场，还是狐狸，不能，对吧？

1599
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:51,360
 So this is will be eaten, so this is illegal state,

1599
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:51,360
所以这是会被吃掉的，所以这是非法状态，

1600
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,959
 so not allowed, and this another illegal state.

1600
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,959
所以不允许，这是另一个非法状态。

1601
01:45:54,959 --> 01:45:57,320
 So this is possible state, okay?

1601
01:45:54,959 --> 01:45:57,320
所以这是可能的状态，好吗？

1602
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:59,400
 So only collect those possible state,

1602
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:59,400
所以只收集那些可能的状态，

1603
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,400
 that form your state space, okay?

1603
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,400
形成你的状态空间，好吗？

1604
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:07,400
 And then you can find the solution from initial state

1604
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:07,400
然后就可以从初始状态求解

1605
01:46:07,639 --> 01:46:12,639
 to reach the goal states, okay?

1605
01:46:07,639 --> 01:46:12,639
达到目标状态，好吗？

1606
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,960
 So how neural network or numerical AI

1606
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,960
那么神经网络或数值人工智能如何

1607
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,679
 doing the representation?

1607
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,679
做代表？

1608
01:46:22,679 --> 01:46:24,920
 And just quick recap, because I like to you

1608
01:46:22,679 --> 01:46:24,920
快速回顾一下，因为我喜欢你

1609
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,639
 to associate these two, okay?

1609
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,639
把这两个联系起来，好吗？

1610
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:29,360
 So you can see the big difference,

1610
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:29,360
所以你可以看到很大的区别

1611
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:32,320
 we are talking about eight puzzle problem.

1611
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:32,320
我们正在谈论八字谜题。

1612
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:37,320
 Okay, so this is symbolic way to write it, numerical way.

1612
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:37,320
好的，这是符号的书写方式，数字的方式。

1613
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,120
 Right, so yeah, you probably use a vector

1613
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,120
是的，所以是的，你可能使用向量

1614
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:47,920
 to represent these states, and then multi-layer,

1614
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:47,920
来表示这些状态，然后是多层，

1615
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:51,280
 many, many layers, and then you want the output layer,

1615
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:51,280
很多很多层，然后你想要输出层，

1616
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:57,440
 to, I don't know, this is what kind of problem?

1616
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:57,440
来，我不知道，这是一个什么样的问题？

1617
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:03,160
 It's not really classification association,

1617
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:03,160
这并不是真正的分类关联，

1618
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:06,320
 but you need to learn the representation.

1618
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:06,320
但你需要学习表示。

1619
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:09,040
 So in the end, those weights value

1619
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:09,040
所以最后，这些权重值

1620
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:13,760
 are the representation of the association, right?

1620
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:13,760
是协会的代表吧？

1621
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:17,200
 So this is a deep neural network approach,

1621
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:17,200
所以这是一种深度神经网络方法，

1622
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,520
 so you can see it's totally data-driven.

1622
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,520
所以你可以看到它完全是数据驱动的。

1623
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:23,360
 It's no abstraction, you see?

1623
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:23,360
这不是抽象的，你明白吗？

1624
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,080
 You see the key difference?

1624
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,080
你看到关键的区别了吗？

1625
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:28,760
 So the key difference, coming up with this representation,

1625
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:28,760
所以关键的区别是提出这个表示，

1626
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:31,559
 you need to have a skill, you need to know.

1626
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:31,559
你需要有技能，你需要知道。

1627
01:47:31,559 --> 01:47:34,320
 That's why we say at early stage,

1627
01:47:31,559 --> 01:47:34,320
这就是为什么我们在早期阶段说，

1628
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:37,840
 normally the one, the person design the chess game can,

1628
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:37,840
通常，设计国际象棋游戏的人可以，

1629
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,320
 like for example, IBM, they win,

1629
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,320
例如，IBM，他们赢了，

1630
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:43,440
 the Deep Blue actually win the world champion.

1630
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:43,440
深蓝实际上赢得了世界冠军。

1631
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:48,440
 The designer, he is a very good chess player, right?

1631
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:48,440
设计师，他是一个非常好的棋手，对吧？

1632
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:52,480
 So he know, he have the knowledge and skills

1632
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:52,480
所以他知道，他有知识和技能

1633
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:56,599
 to design the program in a way which can work well.

1633
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:56,599
以一种可以良好运行的方式设计程序。

1634
01:47:56,599 --> 01:47:59,959
 Okay, because he make, definitely have to use a hints,

1634
01:47:56,599 --> 01:47:59,959
好吧，因为他做，肯定要用到一个提示，

1635
01:47:59,959 --> 01:48:02,200
 definitely have to have a heuristic value.

1635
01:47:59,959 --> 01:48:02,200
绝对必须具有启发价值。

1636
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,839
 Now, cannot use exhaustive search, right?

1636
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,839
现在，不能使用穷举搜索，对吧？

1637
01:48:06,559 --> 01:48:10,919
 Okay, okay, so we have representation,

1637
01:48:06,559 --> 01:48:10,919
好的，好的，所以我们有代表，

1638
01:48:10,919 --> 01:48:13,240
 then we have the state space,

1638
01:48:10,919 --> 01:48:13,240
然后我们有状态空间，

1639
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:17,799
 and normally the state space will form a graph, a graph.

1639
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:17,799
通常状态空间会形成一个图，一个图。

1640
01:48:17,799 --> 01:48:21,799
 Okay, so then we say search, right?

1640
01:48:17,799 --> 01:48:21,799
好吧，那么我们就说搜索，对吧？

1641
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:25,400
 Okay, so hopefully using the graph,

1641
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:25,400
好的，希望使用图表，

1642
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:29,800
 the graph theory can help us to do some search,

1642
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:29,800
图论可以帮助我们做一些搜索，

1643
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:33,240
 can help us to do some theoretical analysis.

1643
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:33,240
可以帮助我们做一些理论分析。

1644
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:37,200
 Okay, so that is a point I want to address here.

1644
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:37,200
好的，这就是我想在这里讨论的一点。

1645
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:42,200
 Okay, so you see river, so this is Konoski problem,

1645
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:42,200
好吧，你看到河流了，这就是科诺斯基问题，

1646
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:49,240
 so very famous about this bridge and seven bridges,

1646
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:49,240
这座桥和七桥非常有名，

1647
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:52,519
 and also the river and two river bank,

1647
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:52,519
还有河流和两条河岸，

1648
01:48:52,519 --> 01:48:55,519
 and then two islands here, okay?

1648
01:48:52,519 --> 01:48:55,519
然后这里还有两个岛，好吗？

1649
01:48:55,519 --> 01:49:00,519
 So suppose we want to visit, we want to plan a trip

1649
01:48:55,519 --> 01:49:00,519
假设我们想去参观，我们想计划一次旅行

1650
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:05,260
 which can cover each of the bridge once and only once.

1650
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:05,260
它可以覆盖每座桥一次且仅一次。

1651
01:49:06,599 --> 01:49:08,880
 Then we ask ourselves, is that possible?

1651
01:49:06,599 --> 01:49:08,880
然后我们问自己，这可能吗？

1652
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,280
 Is that possible to do it?

1652
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,280
这样可以吗？

1653
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,080
 Can we write a program to do it?

1653
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,080
我们可以写一个程序来做到这一点吗？

1654
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:17,920
 Yeah, sure, we can, actually, we can easily convert

1654
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:17,920
是的，当然，我们可以，实际上，我们可以轻松转换

1655
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:21,280
 to the representation, graph representation, right?

1655
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:21,280
到表示法，图形表示法，对吗？

1656
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:26,280
 Each of these river bank use a note in the graph, right?

1656
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:26,280
每个河岸都在图中使用了注释，对吗？

1657
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:31,280
 So river bank one, river bank two,

1657
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:31,280
所以河岸一，河岸二，

1658
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,920
 and then island one, and island two,

1658
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,920
然后是一号岛和二号岛，

1659
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,640
 and then seven bridges, so are the arcs, right?

1659
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,640
然后是七座桥，弧线也是如此，对吧？

1660
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,600
 So this is naturally matched with the graph.

1660
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,600
所以这自然是和图相匹配的。

1661
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,720
 And then after we have this graph,

1661
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,720
然后当我们有了这张图之后，

1662
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:45,480
 then yeah, we can draw on the graph,

1662
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:45,480
那么是的，我们可以在图表上绘制，

1663
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:49,280
 like okay, we can start,

1663
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:49,280
好吧，我们可以开始了，

1664
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:53,360
 suppose we think we are able to design algorithm

1664
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:53,360
假设我们认为我们能够设计算法

1665
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,120
 which can actually help us to,

1665
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,120
这实际上可以帮助我们，

1666
01:49:57,759 --> 01:50:00,360
 can go through this bridge once only.

1666
01:49:57,759 --> 01:50:00,360
这座桥只能经过一次。

1667
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:03,080
 So for example, we start from the river bank one,

1667
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:03,080
例如，我们从河岸一开始，

1668
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:05,280
 then we cross the bridge three,

1668
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:05,280
然后我们过三号桥，

1669
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,580
 then cross the bridge two once only,

1669
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,580
然后只过一次二桥，

1670
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:13,580
 and then four, and then D1, and then up to Asan,

1670
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:13,580
然后是四个，然后是 D1，然后到牙山，

1671
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:17,140
 maybe we go through six, and then five,

1671
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:17,140
也许我们会经历六个，然后是五个，

1672
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:22,420
 almost all, but miss out this, right?

1672
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:22,420
几乎全部，但错过了这个，对吧？

1673
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:25,180
 Yeah, so then we start from another location,

1673
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:25,180
是的，那么我们从另一个地方开始，

1674
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:27,500
 maybe we say, oh, go this way, blah, blah,

1674
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:27,500
也许我们会说，哦，走这条路，等等，等等，

1675
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:30,900
 you know, you can exhaustively try, sure, you can try,

1675
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:30,900
你知道，你可以彻底尝试，当然，你可以尝试，

1676
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:33,059
 but then you probably try many times,

1676
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:33,059
但你可能会尝试很多次，

1677
01:50:33,059 --> 01:50:35,100
 and then there is no answer,

1677
01:50:33,059 --> 01:50:35,100
然后就没有答案了

1678
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:38,220
 there is no solution to match.

1678
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:38,220
没有匹配的解决方案。

1679
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:42,780
 Okay, so hopefully we don't need to go this kind of,

1679
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:42,780
好吧，希望我们不需要这样，

1680
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:45,059
 make such effort, waste our effort, right?

1680
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:45,059
做出这样的努力，浪费我们的精力，对吗？

1681
01:50:45,059 --> 01:50:48,019
 So is there any theory can help us

1681
01:50:45,059 --> 01:50:48,019
那么有没有什么理论可以帮助我们呢？

1682
01:50:48,019 --> 01:50:51,059
 to do analysis in advance?

1682
01:50:48,019 --> 01:50:51,059
提前做分析？

1683
01:50:51,059 --> 01:50:54,460
 Yeah, so that's why our mathematician provide this,

1683
01:50:51,059 --> 01:50:54,460
是的，这就是为什么我们的数学家提供这个，

1684
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:59,460
 so the graph actually by the mathematician,

1684
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:59,460
所以这个图实际上是由数学家绘制的，

1685
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:02,179
 yeah, actually tell us certain things

1685
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:02,179
是的，实际上告诉我们一些事情

1686
01:51:02,179 --> 01:51:04,099
 about this particular graph.

1686
01:51:02,179 --> 01:51:04,099
关于这个特定的图表。

1687
01:51:04,099 --> 01:51:09,099
 Okay, look at the number of the nodes

1687
01:51:04,099 --> 01:51:09,099
好吧，看看节点数

1688
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:14,500
 which has odd number of the connections, okay?

1688
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:14,500
其中有奇数个连接，好吗？

1689
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:18,900
 So this is one, two, three, four, five, right?

1689
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:18,900
所以这是一、二、三、四、五，对吧？

1690
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:23,900
 So we have one node which has odd number of the edges.

1690
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:23,900
所以我们有一个具有奇数条边的节点。

1691
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:26,540
 This also three, right?

1691
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:26,540
这也是三个吧？

1692
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:30,340
 We have two, we have three, we have four.

1692
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:30,340
我们有两个，我们有三个，我们有四个。

1693
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:34,620
 Four nodes all have odd number of the connections.

1693
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:34,620
四个节点都有奇数个连接。

1694
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:36,860
 So based on his theory,

1694
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:36,860
所以根据他的理论，

1695
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:39,860
 his theory actually tell us

1695
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:39,860
他的理论实际上告诉我们

1696
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:44,860
 you can only have zero or two odd nodes,

1696
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:44,860
你只能有零个或两个奇数节点，

1697
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:48,980
 then possibly you can solve the problem.

1697
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:48,980
那么也许你可以解决问题。

1698
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:51,460
 Okay, so this one we have four.

1698
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:51,460
好的，所以这个我们有四个。

1699
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:52,900
 So is that possible?

1699
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:52,900
那么这可能吗？

1700
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,340
 The answer is no.

1700
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,340
答案是否定的。

1701
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:56,140
 So no answer for this.

1701
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:56,140
所以这个问题没有答案。

1702
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:58,820
 We don't need to waste our time for that.

1702
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:58,820
我们不需要为此浪费时间。

1703
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:01,500
 Okay, so that's the nice thing of, you know,

1703
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:01,500
好吧，这就是好事，你知道，

1704
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:05,020
 with when we come back to this representation,

1704
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:05,020
当我们回到这个表示时，

1705
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:06,540
 now we make use of the graph theory

1705
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:06,540
现在我们利用图论

1706
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:10,580
 to help us to make decision.

1706
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:10,580
帮助我们做出决定。

1707
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:14,140
 Okay, yeah, so this is one about the graph.

1707
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:14,140
好的，是的，这是关于图表的。

1708
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:15,540
 Then we have nodes, we have arcs,

1708
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:15,540
然后我们有节点，我们有弧，

1709
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:17,300
 so those is converting.

1709
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:17,300
所以这些正在转换。

1710
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:20,420
 And then the strategy is to search, right?

1710
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:20,420
然后策略就是搜索，对吧？

1711
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:23,780
 So just now we say, yeah, the programmers ability

1711
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:23,780
所以刚才我们说，是啊，程序员的能力

1712
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:27,760
 actually is a one play very important role.

1712
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:27,760
实际上是一个扮演着非常重要的角色。

1713
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:31,420
 So that's why we say the computer or the AI,

1713
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:31,420
这就是为什么我们说计算机或人工智能，

1714
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:37,420
 actually who gave the soul to the code or to the program?

1714
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:37,420
到底是谁赋予了代码或程序灵魂呢？

1715
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:39,380
 Still the designer, right?

1715
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:39,380
还是设计师吧？

1716
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:42,860
 The designer still keep the most important thing.

1716
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:42,860
设计师仍然保留了最重要的东西。

1717
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:44,580
 But not nowaday, right?

1717
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:44,580
但现在不是，对吧？

1718
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:49,060
 Data driven, data driven is no longer that way.

1718
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:49,060
数据驱动，数据驱动不再是这样。

1719
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:51,940
 Okay, but the symbolic AI, yes.

1719
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:51,940
好吧，但是象征性的人工智能，是的。

1720
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:52,780
 Okay.

1720
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:52,780
好的。

1721
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:58,940
 Yeah, so we have this, what is this?

1721
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:58,940
是的，所以我们有这个，这是什么？

1722
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:02,059
 Oh yeah, graph theory can be used to analysis structure

1722
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:02,059
哦对了，图论可以用来分析结构

1723
01:53:02,059 --> 01:53:05,019
 and then complexity of both the problem

1723
01:53:02,059 --> 01:53:05,019
然后是问题的复杂性

1724
01:53:05,019 --> 01:53:07,099
 and also procedure to solve it.

1724
01:53:05,019 --> 01:53:07,099
以及解决它的程序。

1725
01:53:07,099 --> 01:53:12,099
 Okay, so this is Euler rules here.

1725
01:53:07,099 --> 01:53:12,099
好的，这就是欧拉规则。

1726
01:53:16,339 --> 01:53:20,219
 The conclusion, okay, say unless a graph

1726
01:53:16,339 --> 01:53:20,219
结论好吧，除非有图表

1727
01:53:20,219 --> 01:53:25,219
 contain exactly zero or two nodes of the odd degree,

1727
01:53:20,219 --> 01:53:25,219
恰好包含零个或两个奇数度的节点，

1728
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:27,540
 then it's possible to work through.

1728
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:27,540
那么就有可能解决。

1729
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:29,580
 Okay, otherwise it's not possible.

1729
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:29,580
好吧，不然不可能。

1730
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:31,580
 So just now we check we have four, right?

1730
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:31,580
那么现在我们检查一下我们有四个，对吗？

1731
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:36,580
 Four nodes with odd degree, so cannot.

1731
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:36,580
四个节点的度数为奇数，因此不能。

1732
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:38,940
 Yeah, how about this one?

1732
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:38,940
是啊，这个怎么样？

1733
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:47,060
 This graph can be each of the green edges

1733
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:47,060
该图可以是每条绿色边

1734
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:50,060
 of bridge can be visits once and only once?

1734
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:50,060
桥梁可以参观一次且只能参观一次吗？

1735
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,540
 And why?

1735
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,540
为什么？

1736
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:58,540
 Try starting from here, go this way, this way,

1736
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:58,540
试着从这里开始，走这边，走这边，

1737
01:54:04,019 --> 01:54:07,980
 this way, this way, yeah?

1737
01:54:04,019 --> 01:54:07,980
这边，这边，好吗？

1738
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:08,820
 Can.

1738
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:08,820
能。

1739
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:16,460
 So is this matching with Euler theory?

1739
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:16,460
那么这与欧拉理论相符吗？

1740
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:25,380
 Matching?

1740
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:25,380
匹配？

1741
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:30,740
 How many odd, how many nodes with odd degree?

1741
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:30,740
有多少个奇数，有多少个度数为奇数的节点？

1742
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:35,019
 Zero, so yes.

1742
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:35,019
零，所以是的。

1743
01:54:35,019 --> 01:54:37,700
 Okay, good, we have the theory to support.

1743
01:54:35,019 --> 01:54:37,700
好吧，很好，我们有理论支持。

1744
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:41,860
 So give us a confidence, we can, yeah, we can do it.

1744
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:41,860
所以给我们信心，我们可以，是的，我们可以做到。

1745
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:45,100
 Okay, so that's why, so what is graph?

1745
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:45,100
好吧，这就是为什么，那么什么是图表呢？

1746
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:46,900
 Okay, there's no need to talk loud.

1746
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:46,900
好吧，没必要大声说话。

1747
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:47,740
 What is a graph?

1747
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:47,740
什么是图表？

1748
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:52,220
 You all know nodes have graph, the connections,

1748
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:52,220
你们都知道节点有图、连接、

1749
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:54,340
 the edges or arc.

1749
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:54,340
边缘或弧线。

1750
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:56,140
 Then the tree is a special one.

1750
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:56,140
那么这棵树是一棵特别的树。

1751
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:58,940
 Tree is, you know, to any nodes,

1751
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:58,940
你知道，树对于任何节点来说，

1752
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:01,140
 you can only have one path to reach it.

1752
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:01,140
你只有一条路可以到达它。

1753
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:04,420
 Okay, so it's a special case of the graph.

1753
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:04,420
好的，这是该图的一个特例。

1754
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:08,900
 So you have children, have parents, these kind of siblings.

1754
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:08,900
所以你有孩子，有父母，这些兄弟姐妹。

1755
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:12,660
 Okay, so space-based approach to problem solving.

1755
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:12,660
好的，基于空间的方法来解决问题。

1756
01:55:12,660 --> 01:55:14,940
 Basically, you have the nodes, you have the arc,

1756
01:55:12,660 --> 01:55:14,940
基本上，你有节点，你有弧，

1757
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:16,740
 and then you have the state space,

1757
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:16,740
然后你就有了状态空间，

1758
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:18,540
 and then you need to search,

1758
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:18,540
然后你需要搜索，

1759
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:20,300
 and then finding solution paths

1759
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:20,300
然后寻找解决路径

1760
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:22,540
 from the starting nodes to the goal nodes.

1760
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:22,540
从起始节点到目标节点。

1761
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:25,940
 Okay, so that is the symbolic AI

1761
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:25,940
好吧，这就是象征性的AI

1762
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:28,660
 that we represented in graph.

1762
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:28,660
我们用图表表示。

1763
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:33,660
 Okay, and now let's look at this tic-tac-toe problem.

1763
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:33,660
好的，现在让我们来看看这个井字棋问题。

1764
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:38,060
 Okay, so tic-tac-toes, we have cross,

1764
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:38,060
好吧，井字游戏，我们有十字架，

1765
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:39,500
 and we have circle, right?

1765
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:39,500
我们有圆圈，对吗？

1766
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:43,860
 Initially, yeah, nine positions empty,

1766
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:43,860
最初，是的，有九个位置空着，

1767
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:48,780
 and then, so who, probably the cross is the first player.

1767
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:48,780
那么，那么谁呢，恐怕就是第一个传中的球员了。

1768
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:52,780
 So cross can put in nine places, right?

1768
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:52,780
那么cross可以放在九个位置，对吧？

1769
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:57,780
 Yeah, any of the place legal, right?

1769
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:57,780
是的，任何地方都是合法的，对吧？

1770
01:55:58,219 --> 01:56:01,380
 Yeah, either on the corner, so you have four choice.

1770
01:55:58,219 --> 01:56:01,380
是的，要么在拐角处，所以你有四种选择。

1771
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:06,380
 One corner, one corner, another corner, another corner, right?

1771
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:06,380
一个角落，一个角落，另一个角落，另一个角落，对吗？

1772
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:10,660
 And then you can put in the middle, another four, right?

1772
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:10,660
然后你可以在中间再放四个，对吧？

1773
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:13,019
 So, and also you can, sorry, sorry,

1773
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:13,019
所以，你也可以，对不起，对不起，

1774
01:56:13,019 --> 01:56:15,259
 middle of the row or columns.

1774
01:56:13,019 --> 01:56:15,259
行或列的中间。

1775
01:56:15,259 --> 01:56:18,420
 And then you can also put into the very much the center,

1775
01:56:15,259 --> 01:56:18,420
然后你也可以把它放到非常中心，

1776
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:20,060
 right, so total nine.

1776
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:20,060
对，所以总共九个。

1777
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:21,500
 And then after you put this,

1777
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:21,500
然后你把这个之后，

1778
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:24,900
 then the player is a circle player turn.

1778
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:24,900
然后玩家轮到一个圆圈玩家。

1779
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:26,900
 So because you take one space already,

1779
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:26,900
因为你已经占了一个空格，

1780
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:30,220
 then I only have eight places to put my circle, right?

1780
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:30,220
那我就只有八个地方可以放我的圆圈了，对吧？

1781
01:56:31,180 --> 01:56:32,500
 So this is how you play.

1781
01:56:31,180 --> 01:56:32,500
这就是你的玩法。

1782
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:35,020
 And then in the end, yeah, of course,

1782
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:35,020
最后，是的，当然，

1783
01:56:35,020 --> 01:56:36,900
 whoever they want to win, right?

1783
01:56:35,020 --> 01:56:36,900
他们想赢谁就赢谁，对吧？

1784
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:40,300
 So they link up the whole row, or link up the diagonal,

1784
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:40,300
所以他们把整行连接起来，或者把对角线连接起来，

1785
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:42,500
 or link up the whole vertical.

1785
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:42,500
或连接整个垂直方向。

1786
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:46,320
 Yeah, so total, this is a total possible movement.

1786
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:46,320
是的，所以总体而言，这是一个完全可能的运动。

1787
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:51,320
 Okay, so looks big, but still small,

1787
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:51,320
好吧，看起来很大，但还是很小，

1788
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:56,320
 still manageable, very much manageable size for computer.

1788
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:56,320
仍然可以管理，非常适合计算机管理的大小。

1789
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:03,320
 And so this is, you know, example to show us

1789
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:03,320
所以这是向我们展示的例子

1790
01:57:03,519 --> 01:57:05,719
 how we should have a note, then we have arc,

1790
01:57:03,519 --> 01:57:05,719
我们应该如何有一个注释，然后我们有弧线，

1791
01:57:05,719 --> 01:57:09,440
 and then we have a state, starting state, and then go state.

1791
01:57:05,719 --> 01:57:09,440
然后我们有一个状态，开始状态，然后进入状态。

1792
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:13,240
 So again, again, I try to show this.

1792
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:13,240
所以，我再次尝试展示这一点。

1793
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:15,920
 So then starting from here,

1793
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:15,920
那么从这里开始，

1794
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,000
 if you want to win, then probably you should put

1794
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,000
如果你想赢，那么你可能应该把

1795
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,560
 in the center, and then suppose the opponent puts

1795
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,560
放在中间，然后假设对手将

1796
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,160
 on the right-hand side, now I should move

1796
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,160
在右手边，现在我应该移动

1797
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:28,880
 to the left top corner.

1797
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:28,880
到左上角。

1798
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:33,640
 I put here, likely, unless they put here,

1798
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:33,640
我可能放在这里，除非他们放在这里，

1799
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:36,280
 otherwise I can win the case, right?

1799
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:36,280
不然我能打赢官司，对吗？

1800
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:39,480
 So this is the possible movement.

1800
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:39,480
所以这就是可能的运动。

1801
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:45,520
 Okay, yeah, so the puzzle, so now we can have

1801
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:45,520
好的，是的，拼图，现在我们可以有

1802
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:51,120
 15, so four by four, so you have 15 number,

1802
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:51,120
15，所以四乘四，所以你有 15 个数字，

1803
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:55,400
 number the tower, plus one empty tower.

1803
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:55,400
给塔编号，加上一座空塔。

1804
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:59,520
 Okay, so again, you can only move up, left, right, down,

1804
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:59,520
好吧，再说一次，你只能向上、向左、向右、向下移动，

1805
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,600
 or something like four kind of movement.

1805
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,600
或者类似四种运动。

1806
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:06,160
 So this eight puzzle problem, and then the goal is,

1806
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:06,160
所以这八个难题，然后目标是，

1807
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:11,440
 so suppose the goal is moving the towers in and out

1807
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:11,440
所以假设目标是将塔移进移出

1808
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:15,180
 in the bank space, and depend on, you can define,

1808
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:15,180
在银行空间中，并且取决于，您可以定义，

1809
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:17,580
 you want to sort it, or you want to, you know,

1809
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:17,580
你想要对其进行排序，或者你想要，你知道，

1810
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:20,500
 depends what is your goal state, and you can specify.

1810
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:20,500
取决于您的目标状态是什么，您可以指定。

1811
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:23,580
 Yeah, so,

1811
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:23,580
是的，所以，

1812
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:29,340
 so this is actually, state space is larger

1812
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:29,340
所以这实际上是，状态空间更大

1813
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:34,020
 than the tic-tac-toe, okay, but still probably manageable.

1813
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:34,020
比井字棋好，但仍然可能是可控的。

1814
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:38,460
 And then probably the state space will be more like

1814
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:38,460
然后状态空间可能会更像

1815
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:42,820
 graph rather than a tree, that means have loop back, okay.

1815
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:42,820
图而不是树，这意味着有环回，好吧。

1816
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:47,820
 Yeah, like what we have, you know, this can be,

1816
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:47,820
是的，就像我们所拥有的，你知道，这可以是，

1817
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:50,660
 go back there, then become a graph, okay,

1817
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:50,660
回到那里，然后变成一个图表，好吧，

1818
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:53,099
 but of course you can also don't allow this,

1818
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:53,099
但当然你也可以不允许这样做，

1819
01:58:53,099 --> 01:58:54,620
 there is a tree, okay.

1819
01:58:53,099 --> 01:58:54,620
有棵树，好吧。

1820
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:02,340
 Ah, so we can have some exercise on this, okay,

1820
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:02,340
啊，所以我们可以做一些练习，好吧，

1821
01:59:03,019 --> 01:59:06,299
 so can like take a look at this.

1821
01:59:03,019 --> 01:59:06,299
所以可以看看这个。

1822
01:59:06,299 --> 01:59:09,580
 So we had the puzzle, we had the tic-tac-toe,

1822
01:59:06,299 --> 01:59:09,580
所以我们有拼图，我们有井字棋，

1823
01:59:09,580 --> 01:59:13,980
 we had the farmer and the positions,

1823
01:59:09,580 --> 01:59:13,980
我们有农民和职位，

1824
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:15,740
 now we look at another problem,

1824
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:15,740
现在我们来看另一个问题，

1825
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:19,160
 which is also symbolic, AI can solve.

1825
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:19,160
这也是象征性的，AI可以解决。

1826
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:24,000
 Okay, so suppose we are given two jars, water jar, okay,

1826
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:24,000
好吧，假设我们有两个罐子，水罐，好吧，

1827
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,500
 so one is four liter, it can contain four liter water,

1827
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,500
所以一是四升，它可以容纳四升水，

1828
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:30,480
 another one is three liter water,

1828
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:30,480
另一份是三升水，

1829
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:34,019
 and there is no reading for each of jar, so we don't know.

1829
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:34,019
而且每个罐子都没有读数，所以我们不知道。

1830
01:59:34,019 --> 01:59:36,980
 We only know full or empty, okay.

1830
01:59:34,019 --> 01:59:36,980
我们只知道满或空，好吧。

1831
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:41,139
 And then a water tap is provided, so we can refill,

1831
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:41,139
然后提供了一个水龙头，所以我们可以补充水，

1832
01:59:41,139 --> 01:59:43,019
 and also that's a drain available,

1832
01:59:41,139 --> 01:59:43,019
还有一个可用的排水管，

1833
01:59:43,019 --> 01:59:44,820
 so we can pull water out,

1833
01:59:43,019 --> 01:59:44,820
这样我们就可以把水抽出来

1834
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:47,099
 so those are the things available.

1834
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:47,099
这些就是可用的东西。

1835
01:59:47,099 --> 01:59:52,099
 And then we, the goal or the aim of this problem is

1835
01:59:47,099 --> 01:59:52,099
然后我们这个问题的目标是

1836
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:58,860
 we want to get exactly two liter of water in the jar full,

1836
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:58,860
我们想要在罐子里装满两升水，

1837
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:02,120
 okay, that means four liter jar.

1837
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:02,120
好的，这意味着四升罐子。

1838
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:08,120
 So, so, we cannot estimate, cannot say, ah, estimate half,

1838
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:08,120
所以,所以,我们不能估计,不能说啊,估计一半,

1839
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:11,180
 okay, no, cannot do that.

1839
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:11,180
好吧，不，不能那样做。

1840
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:16,180
 So we need to use a proper way to throw away or fill up,

1840
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:16,180
所以我们需要用正确的方式去扔掉或者填满，

1841
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:19,440
 and to achieve the goal, okay.

1841
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:19,440
并实现目标，好吧。

1842
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:22,200
 So suppose state representation,

1842
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:22,200
所以假设国家代表，

1843
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:26,700
 we suggest you use this X and Y to denote respectively

1843
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:26,700
我们建议你用这个X和Y来分别表示

1844
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:29,500
 the jar full or jar free, okay,

1844
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:29,500
罐子满了还是空了，好吧，

1845
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:32,620
 and then we can have an initial state,

1845
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:32,620
然后我们可以有一个初始状态，

1846
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:36,140
 so initial state you can, up to you,

1846
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:36,140
所以初始状态你可以，由你决定，

1847
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:38,420
 you can initialize equal to zero zero,

1847
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:38,420
你可以初始化等于零零，

1848
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:42,660
 so both jars empty, or you can even full, you know,

1848
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:42,660
所以两个罐子都是空的，或者你甚至可以装满，你知道，

1849
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:46,420
 up to you, okay, you can assume initial state.

1849
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:46,420
由你决定，好吧，你可以假设初始状态。

1850
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:47,620
 The goal state is what?

1850
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:47,620
目标状态是什么？

1851
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:50,140
 What is the goal state?

1851
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:50,140
目标状态是什么？

1852
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:58,460
 Two, did they say anything about jar full, jar free?

1852
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:58,460
第二，他们有没有说过罐子满了、罐子空了？

1853
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:00,940
 No, so it can be anything in jar free,

1853
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:00,940
不，所以它可以是罐子里的任何东西，

1854
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:05,980
 but we only care about jar full is two, okay.

1854
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:05,980
但我们只关心罐子满了是两个，好吧。

1855
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:09,700
 So anything in the jar free can be okay,

1855
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:09,700
所以罐子里任何免费的东西都可以，

1856
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:12,780
 that consider one of the goal states.

1856
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:12,780
考虑目标状态之一。

1857
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:16,040
 So write down the initial state, goal state,

1857
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:16,040
所以写下初始状态，目标状态，

1858
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:20,140
 and then list out all the legal movements,

1858
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:20,140
然后列出所有合法的动作，

1859
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:22,820
 or operation, or manipulation.

1859
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:22,820
或操作，或操纵。

1860
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:27,820
 So, for example, fill up, you know, jar full from the tap,

1860
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:27,820
所以，举个例子，从水龙头里装满罐子，

1861
02:01:28,340 --> 02:01:32,660
 or empty jar free into drain,

1861
02:01:28,340 --> 02:01:32,660
或空罐子自由进入排水沟，

1862
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:36,019
 or empty jar full into drain,

1862
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:36,019
或将空罐子倒入排水沟，

1863
02:01:36,019 --> 02:01:40,259
 or pull over, you know, from one jar to another,

1863
02:01:36,019 --> 02:01:40,259
或者把车从一个罐子停到另一个罐子，

1864
02:01:40,259 --> 02:01:44,740
 this all legal, okay, write down all the legal movement,

1864
02:01:40,259 --> 02:01:44,740
这一切都是合法的，好吧，写下所有合法的动作，

1865
02:01:44,740 --> 02:01:47,259
 and then try to draw this graph.

1865
02:01:44,740 --> 02:01:47,259
然后尝试绘制这个图。

1866
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:54,700
 Your turn, quick exercise for that,

1866
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:54,700
轮到你了，快速练习一下，

1867
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:58,900
 and we can check the answer soon.

1867
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:58,900
我们很快就能检查答案。

1868
02:02:07,099 --> 02:02:09,340
 So we are not just learning theory,

1868
02:02:07,099 --> 02:02:09,340
所以我们不只是学习理论，

1869
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:11,599
 we are having some exercise now.

1869
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:11,599
我们现在正在做一些运动。

1870
02:02:15,099 --> 02:02:17,660
 Drawing, do some drawing.

1870
02:02:15,099 --> 02:02:17,660
画画，画一些。

1871
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:28,260
 So I suggest we all have zero, zero to start,

1871
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:28,260
所以我建议我们都从零开始，

1872
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:32,620
 and then goal state is two, zero, how about that?

1872
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:32,620
然后目标状态是二、零，怎么样？

1873
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:55,780
 Any question?

1873
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:55,780
有什么问题吗？

1874
02:02:57,380 --> 02:02:58,380
 You can try.

1874
02:02:57,380 --> 02:02:58,380
你可以尝试一下。

1875
02:03:24,700 --> 02:03:25,540
 Okay.

1875
02:03:24,700 --> 02:03:25,540
好的。

1876
02:03:54,700 --> 02:03:55,540
 Okay.

1876
02:03:54,700 --> 02:03:55,540
好的。

1877
02:04:24,700 --> 02:04:25,540
 Okay.

1877
02:04:24,700 --> 02:04:25,540
好的。

1878
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:55,540
 Okay.

1878
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:55,540
好的。

1879
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:25,540
 Okay.

1879
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:25,540
好的。

1880
02:05:54,700 --> 02:05:55,540
 Okay.

1880
02:05:54,700 --> 02:05:55,540
好的。

1881
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:25,540
 Okay.

1881
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:25,540
好的。

1882
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:55,540
 Okay.

1882
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:55,540
好的。

1883
02:07:24,700 --> 02:07:25,540
 Okay.

1883
02:07:24,700 --> 02:07:25,540
好的。

1884
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:55,540
 Okay.

1884
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:55,540
好的。

1885
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:25,540
 Okay.

1885
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:25,540
好的。

1886
02:08:36,380 --> 02:08:41,019
 Okay, so, yeah, we can have one, like,

1886
02:08:36,380 --> 02:08:41,019
好吧，所以，是的，我们可以有一个，比如，

1887
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:45,900
 very commonly we can believe starting from,

1887
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:45,900
我们通常可以相信，

1888
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:48,860
 the starting state is zero, zero, right?

1888
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:48,860
起始状态为零，零，对吗？

1889
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:52,420
 Or anything, it's also possible starting state,

1889
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:52,420
或者什么，也可能是起始状态，

1890
02:08:52,420 --> 02:08:54,500
 as long as the i is less than four,

1890
02:08:52,420 --> 02:08:54,500
只要 i 小于四，

1891
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:56,780
 and the j is less than three, right?

1891
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:56,780
j 小于 3，对吧？

1892
02:08:56,780 --> 02:08:57,840
 Possible starting.

1892
02:08:56,780 --> 02:08:57,840
可能开始。

1893
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:05,900
 Can be equal, yeah, actually can be equal to zero,

1893
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:05,900
可以等于，是的，实际上可以等于零，

1894
02:09:05,900 --> 02:09:08,940
 but I just say this already separated out.

1894
02:09:05,900 --> 02:09:08,940
但我只是说这已经分开了。

1895
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:12,940
 So then this one is, if you don't consider zero,

1895
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:12,940
那么这个，如果你不考虑零的话，

1896
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:16,540
 actually can be here zero, zero.

1896
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:16,540
实际上这里可以是零，零。

1897
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:21,140
 Okay, then goal, this is, can be one goal,

1897
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:21,140
好吧，那么目标，这就是，可以是一个目标，

1898
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:23,660
 can be like this, right?

1898
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:23,660
可以这样吧？

1899
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:27,340
 You want the two, little water in the jar four,

1899
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:27,340
你想要两个，罐子里的一点点水，四个，

1900
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:30,380
 anything in the jar three, doesn't matter.

1900
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:30,380
三号罐子里的任何东西都没关系。

1901
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:34,500
 Okay, so those are the possible six operations.

1901
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:34,500
好的，这就是可能的六种操作。

1902
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:39,500
 Yeah, so we build up like this, or transfer like this,

1902
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:39,500
是的，所以我们像这样建立，或者像这样转移，

1903
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:46,940
 and then we can show something like this, right?

1903
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:46,940
然后我们可以展示这样的东西，对吗？

1904
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:52,940
 So initially zero, zero, and then if you apply rule one,

1904
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:52,940
所以最初为零，零，然后如果你应用规则一，

1905
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:54,299
 then you get this.

1905
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:54,299
然后你就明白了。

1906
02:09:54,299 --> 02:09:57,700
 If you apply rule three, you get this.

1906
02:09:54,299 --> 02:09:57,700
如果你应用第三条规则，你就会得到这个。

1907
02:09:57,700 --> 02:10:00,339
 From here, you apply rule six,

1907
02:09:57,700 --> 02:10:00,339
从这里开始，您应用规则六，

1908
02:10:00,339 --> 02:10:05,339
 which is transfer the four to the jar three,

1908
02:10:00,339 --> 02:10:05,339
即将四个转移到罐子三中，

1909
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:08,259
 and reach this, yeah?

1909
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:08,259
并达到这个目标，是吗？

1910
02:10:08,259 --> 02:10:13,259
 So this one, from zero to, is it possible from zero, three,

1910
02:10:08,259 --> 02:10:13,259
那么这个,从零到,有没有可能从零、三、

1911
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:14,980
 to two, one?

1911
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:14,980
到二、一？

1912
02:10:17,700 --> 02:10:18,620
 Is that possible?

1912
02:10:17,700 --> 02:10:18,620
这可能吗？

1913
02:10:20,299 --> 02:10:22,860
 Not possible, yeah.

1913
02:10:20,299 --> 02:10:22,860
不可能，是的。

1914
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:25,620
 You don't know which rule to apply, right?

1914
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:25,620
您不知道该应用哪条规则，对吗？

1915
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:28,179
 Can we apply any rule?

1915
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:28,179
我们可以应用任何规则吗？

1916
02:10:29,299 --> 02:10:31,980
 Definitely not this one, definitely not this one.

1916
02:10:29,299 --> 02:10:31,980
绝对不是这个，绝对不是这个。

1917
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:34,900
 Not this one, not this one, right?

1917
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:34,900
不是这个，不是这个，对吧？

1918
02:10:34,900 --> 02:10:36,980
 Because empty, this is not empty,

1918
02:10:34,900 --> 02:10:36,980
因为空，这不空，

1919
02:10:36,980 --> 02:10:39,780
 still have one little inside.

1919
02:10:36,980 --> 02:10:39,780
里面还有一点。

1920
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:43,860
 Transfer, oh yeah, actually here say transfer,

1920
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:43,860
转接，哦对了，其实这里说的是转接，

1921
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:45,700
 need to say transfer everything,

1921
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:45,700
需要说转移一切，

1922
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:48,500
 or transfer part of it.

1922
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:48,500
或转移其中的一部分。

1923
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:50,780
 But you cannot say part of it,

1923
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:50,780
但你不能说一部分，

1924
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:53,300
 it can be exactly two, right, cannot measure.

1924
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:53,300
可以正好是两个，对吧，无法测量。

1925
02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:55,780
 So this is not legal.

1925
02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:55,780
所以这是不合法的。

1926
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:57,740
 Okay, good.

1926
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:57,740
好的，很好。

1927
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:00,860
 Here is one possible answer.

1927
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:00,860
这是一个可能的答案。

1928
02:11:10,380 --> 02:11:11,820
 So this is two, three.

1928
02:11:10,380 --> 02:11:11,820
所以这是二、三。

1929
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:15,780
 Yeah, those are not.

1929
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:15,780
是的，那些不是。

1930
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:24,820
 So anyway, this is just one possible answer,

1930
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:24,820
所以无论如何，这只是一个可能的答案，

1931
02:11:24,820 --> 02:11:27,059
 you have many others, okay.

1931
02:11:24,820 --> 02:11:27,059
你还有很多其他人，好吧。

1932
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:34,219
 Okay, so you know how to do, huh?

1932
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:34,219
好吧，你知道该怎么做了吧？

1933
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:35,060
 Okay.

1933
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:35,060
好的。

1934
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:41,820
 And continue our discussion.

1934
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:41,820
并继续我们的讨论。

1935
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:47,020
 Okay, so suppose we have this graph for another example,

1935
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:47,020
好的，假设我们有这个图表作为另一个例子，

1936
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:52,020
 self-travelers, traveling salesman problem, TSP.

1936
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:52,020
自助旅行者，旅行商问题，TSP。

1937
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:58,260
 Okay, so yeah, so you have five cities,

1937
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:58,260
好吧，是的，所以你有五个城市，

1938
02:11:58,260 --> 02:12:03,260
 and then those are the shortest paths to visit, oh sorry.

1938
02:11:58,260 --> 02:12:03,260
然后这些是访问的最短路线，哦抱歉。

1939
02:12:04,540 --> 02:12:06,420
 We want to find the shortest path

1939
02:12:04,540 --> 02:12:06,420
我们想要找到最短路径

1940
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:08,940
 to visit all the five cities, okay.

1940
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:08,940
去所有五个城市，好吧。

1941
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:13,500
 Each city only visit once, return to the original city.

1941
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:13,500
每个城市只访问一次，返回原城市。

1942
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:14,740
 So is that possible?

1942
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:14,740
那么这可能吗？

1943
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:16,700
 So when we look at this graph,

1943
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:16,700
所以当我们看这个图表时，

1944
02:12:16,700 --> 02:12:19,300
 then first question is to ask ourselves,

1944
02:12:16,700 --> 02:12:19,300
那么第一个问题就是问我们自己，

1945
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:21,140
 just like the bridge, okay.

1945
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:21,140
就像桥一样，好吧。

1946
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:22,740
 So is that possible to do this?

1946
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:22,740
那么可以这样做吗？

1947
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:26,260
 Yeah, any odd notes?

1947
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:26,260
是啊，有什么奇怪的笔记吗？

1948
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:30,260
 Yeah, no, so it's zero, so it's possible.

1948
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:30,260
是的，不，所以它是零，所以这是可能的。

1949
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:32,100
 Okay, then we want to find,

1949
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:32,100
好吧，那么我们想要找到，

1950
02:12:32,140 --> 02:12:36,140
 so it's possible to visit all the cities once

1950
02:12:32,140 --> 02:12:36,140
所以可以一次访问所有城市

1951
02:12:36,140 --> 02:12:37,820
 and only once, yeah.

1951
02:12:36,140 --> 02:12:37,820
而且只有一次，是的。

1952
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:41,900
 But then this question is not only once and only once,

1952
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:41,900
但是这个问题不只一次而且只有一次，

1953
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:44,140
 but also the shortest one.

1953
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:44,140
但也是最短的。

1954
02:12:44,140 --> 02:12:49,140
 Okay, so we need to figure out all the possible way,

1954
02:12:44,140 --> 02:12:49,140
好吧，所以我们需要找出所有可能的方法，

1955
02:12:50,260 --> 02:12:53,740
 visit all the five places once and only once,

1955
02:12:50,260 --> 02:12:53,740
这五个地方都参观一次且仅一次，

1956
02:12:53,740 --> 02:12:56,940
 and then we compare which one give us the shortest,

1956
02:12:53,740 --> 02:12:56,940
然后我们比较哪一个给我们的时间最短，

1957
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:59,900
 and then that is the answer, okay.

1957
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:59,900
然后这就是答案，好吧。

1958
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:04,139
 Yeah, so possible, and then we find the shortest one.

1958
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:04,139
是的，很有可能，然后我们找到最短的一个。

1959
02:13:04,139 --> 02:13:09,139
 Yeah, so here, this is like, yeah, starting from A,

1959
02:13:04,139 --> 02:13:09,139
是的，所以在这里，这就像，是的，从 A 开始，

1960
02:13:09,820 --> 02:13:14,820
 then go to B, so this is miles or whatever, kilometers,

1960
02:13:09,820 --> 02:13:14,820
然后去B，所以这是英里或其他什么，公里，

1961
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:21,620
 so all the cost, okay, so we indicate along the edge.

1961
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:21,620
所以所有的成本，好吧，所以我们沿着边缘指示。

1962
02:13:21,620 --> 02:13:25,980
 And then this is to the C, and to D, to E,

1962
02:13:21,620 --> 02:13:25,980
然后是C、D、E，

1963
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:29,099
 you know, we attach with, based on the graph,

1963
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:29,099
你知道，我们根据图表附上，

1964
02:13:29,140 --> 02:13:32,500
 and then we work out, so add up,

1964
02:13:29,140 --> 02:13:32,500
然后我们计算，所以加起来，

1965
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:35,180
 and then we know which one is the shortest, right,

1965
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:35,180
然后我们就知道哪一个是最短的，对吧，

1966
02:13:36,180 --> 02:13:37,200
 the total cost.

1966
02:13:36,180 --> 02:13:37,200
总成本。

1967
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:42,020
 Okay, so this is exhaustive search, kind of, okay,

1967
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:42,020
好的，这是详尽的搜索，有点，好吧，

1968
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:46,100
 you have the whole space, and then you can find the answer

1968
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:46,100
你拥有整个空间，然后你就能找到答案

1969
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:49,700
 later by exhaustive search, you can get the answer.

1969
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:49,700
稍后通过穷举搜索，即可得到答案。

1970
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:54,340
 So now you can see, I hope from there you can see

1970
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:54,340
所以现在你可以看到，我希望从那里你可以看到

1971
02:13:54,340 --> 02:13:58,140
 the search strategy is very important, right.

1971
02:13:54,340 --> 02:13:58,140
搜索策略非常重要，对吧。

1972
02:13:58,140 --> 02:14:02,540
 So that is six, five cities is really a toy problem.

1972
02:13:58,140 --> 02:14:02,540
所以说六、五个城市确实是一个玩具问题。

1973
02:14:02,540 --> 02:14:05,180
 We talk about 100 cities, for example,

1973
02:14:02,540 --> 02:14:05,180
我们谈论100个城市，例如，

1974
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:09,340
 then the space will be expanded hugely.

1974
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:09,340
那么空间就会被极大的扩大。

1975
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:13,680
 Yeah, so that's why strategy behind this is important.

1975
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:13,680
是的，这就是为什么这背后的策略很重要。

1976
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:20,740
 So there are a few things to pay attention to.

1976
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:20,740
所以有几点需要注意。

1977
02:14:20,740 --> 02:14:24,220
 One is to see whether it's a completeness.

1977
02:14:20,740 --> 02:14:24,220
一是看是否完整。

1978
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:28,060
 That means if the strategy can always help us

1978
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:28,060
这意味着如果该策略总能帮助我们

1979
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:31,260
 to find a solution, if this solution exists.

1979
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:31,260
找到一个解决方案，如果这个解决方案存在的话。

1980
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:36,300
 And then another one is time complexity.

1980
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:36,300
另外一个是时间复杂度。

1981
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:38,660
 That means how fast you can do.

1981
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:38,660
这意味着你能做多快。

1982
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:41,700
 And then space complexity, now do you need to store

1982
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:41,700
然后空间复杂度，现在需要存储吗

1983
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:45,200
 everything, or you can store partially things?

1983
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:45,200
一切，或者你可以存储部分东西？

1984
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:48,500
 Another thing is whether it's optimal.

1984
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:48,500
另一件事是它是否是最佳的。

1985
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:52,580
 So that is, can we find the least cost one?

1985
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:52,580
那么我们能否找到成本最低的一个呢？

1986
02:14:52,580 --> 02:14:57,580
 So that is a way to judge which is a better strategy.

1986
02:14:52,580 --> 02:14:57,580
所以这是判断哪种策略更好的一种方法。

1987
02:14:58,460 --> 02:15:03,460
 So the complexity we try to see, the BHA is talking about

1987
02:14:58,460 --> 02:15:03,460
所以我们试图看到 BHA 正在谈论的复杂性

1988
02:15:05,019 --> 02:15:08,580
 branch factor, the depths and the maximum depths.

1988
02:15:05,019 --> 02:15:08,580
分支因子、深度和最大深度。

1989
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:11,700
 So I think this is purely for your information,

1989
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:11,700
所以我认为这纯粹是为了给你提供信息

1990
02:15:11,700 --> 02:15:13,700
 we are not going to test you on this.

1990
02:15:11,700 --> 02:15:13,700
我们不会在这方面考验你。

1991
02:15:13,700 --> 02:15:16,620
 So it's just basic knowledge.

1991
02:15:13,700 --> 02:15:16,620
所以这只是基础知识。

1992
02:15:16,620 --> 02:15:20,620
 Basically we would know two type of search.

1992
02:15:16,620 --> 02:15:20,620
基本上我们会知道两种类型的搜索。

1993
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:25,300
 One is totally exhaustive blind search,

1993
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:25,300
一种是完全详尽的盲目搜索，

1994
02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:28,180
 or un-informed search.

1994
02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:28,180
或不知情的搜索。

1995
02:15:28,180 --> 02:15:31,380
 So how to systematically search to find answer.

1995
02:15:28,180 --> 02:15:31,380
那么如何系统地搜索来寻找答案。

1996
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:32,500
 Another one is informed.

1996
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:32,500
另一位被告知。

1997
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:35,700
 So informed is a heuristic-based search.

1997
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:35,700
因此，基于启发式的搜索是明智的。

1998
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:38,300
 So we are going to cover other search methods.

1998
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:38,300
所以我们将介绍其他搜索方法。

1999
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:42,580
 Exhaustive and also the most popular one,

1999
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:42,580
详尽且也是最受欢迎的一种，

2000
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:44,940
 and also the heuristic one.

2000
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:44,940
也是启发式的。

2001
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:51,420
 Then another thing is about the data-driven and goal-driven.

2001
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:51,420
然后另一件事是关于数据驱动和目标驱动。

2002
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:53,220
 This is a big strategy.

2002
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:53,220
这是一个大战略。

2003
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:54,800
 Which direction to go?

2003
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:54,800
往哪个方向走？

2004
02:15:55,500 --> 02:16:00,140
 So data-driven meaning we start from the facts.

2004
02:15:55,500 --> 02:16:00,140
所以数据驱动意味着我们从事实出发。

2005
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:03,540
 We start from the knowledge, the partial knowledge we have.

2005
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:03,540
我们从知识开始，从我们拥有的部分知识开始。

2006
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:07,220
 Start from there, then you try to find the answer,

2006
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:07,220
从那里开始，然后你尝试寻找答案，

2007
02:16:07,220 --> 02:16:08,820
 the solution, the goal.

2007
02:16:07,220 --> 02:16:08,820
解决方案，目标。

2008
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:10,460
 So this is a direction.

2008
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:10,460
所以这是一个方向。

2009
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:13,060
 We're based on facts and based on the rule.

2009
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:13,060
我们以事实为依据，以规则为基础。

2010
02:16:13,060 --> 02:16:14,540
 The rule we defined it.

2010
02:16:13,060 --> 02:16:14,540
我们定义它的规则。

2011
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:17,420
 And then we get the new knowledge or updated knowledge

2011
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:17,420
然后我们得到新的知识或者更新的知识

2012
02:16:17,420 --> 02:16:20,660
 and then move on until we find the answer.

2012
02:16:17,420 --> 02:16:20,660
然后继续前进，直到找到答案。

2013
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:25,660
 So this is so-called forward search.

2013
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:25,660
所以这就是所谓的前向搜索。

2014
02:16:25,660 --> 02:16:27,340
 Forward, go forward.

2014
02:16:25,660 --> 02:16:27,340
前进，前进。

2015
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:31,820
 So this is a data-driven.

2015
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:31,820
所以这是一个数据驱动的。

2016
02:16:33,020 --> 02:16:36,780
 Data-driven in symbolic AI context.

2016
02:16:33,020 --> 02:16:36,780
符号人工智能环境中的数据驱动。

2017
02:16:37,619 --> 02:16:41,379
 It's not the data-driven in numerical AI.

2017
02:16:37,619 --> 02:16:41,379
这不是数值人工智能中的数据驱动。

2018
02:16:41,379 --> 02:16:45,080
 Then the goal-driven search is other way around.

2018
02:16:41,379 --> 02:16:45,080
那么目标驱动的搜索则相反。

2019
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:49,500
 We start from one of the winning states, for example.

2019
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:49,500
例如，我们从获胜州之一开始。

2020
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:53,580
 Then go backwards to see what is the sub-goal.

2020
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:53,580
然后倒退看看子目标是什么。

2021
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:56,180
 And then from the sub-goal, backwards.

2021
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:56,180
然后从分目标开始，倒退。

2022
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:57,379
 Try to find.

2022
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:57,379
尝试寻找。

2023
02:16:57,379 --> 02:17:00,540
 And then in the end, can we find all the facts

2023
02:16:57,379 --> 02:17:00,540
最后我们能否找到所有的事实

2024
02:17:00,540 --> 02:17:02,340
 which support the case?

2024
02:17:00,540 --> 02:17:02,340
有哪些支持案例？

2025
02:17:03,379 --> 02:17:05,379
 Okay, so that is the direction.

2025
02:17:03,379 --> 02:17:05,379
好吧，这就是方向。

2026
02:17:05,379 --> 02:17:08,379
 So starting from goal, then see the facts,

2026
02:17:05,379 --> 02:17:08,379
所以从目标出发，然后看事实，

2027
02:17:08,379 --> 02:17:11,299
 and then get the sub-goal, then search backwards,

2027
02:17:08,379 --> 02:17:11,299
然后得到子目标，然后向后搜索，

2028
02:17:11,299 --> 02:17:14,420
 and then see the back to the facts.

2028
02:17:11,299 --> 02:17:14,420
然后再看回到事实。

2029
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:17,420
 So if you find it, then that means

2029
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:17,420
所以如果你找到了它，那就意味着

2030
02:17:18,299 --> 02:17:19,980
 you find the supporting factor.

2030
02:17:18,299 --> 02:17:19,980
你找到了支持因素。

2031
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:27,980
 So here, whether which one we should apply,

2031
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:27,980
所以这里我们到底应该应用哪一种，

2032
02:17:28,860 --> 02:17:31,379
 this depends on the situation.

2032
02:17:28,860 --> 02:17:31,379
这取决于具体情况。

2033
02:17:31,379 --> 02:17:34,500
 So both is, we are talking about search

2033
02:17:31,379 --> 02:17:34,500
所以两者都是，我们正在谈论搜索

2034
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:37,340
 on the same state space.

2034
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:37,340
在同一个状态空间上。

2035
02:17:37,340 --> 02:17:39,139
 So given the same state space,

2035
02:17:37,340 --> 02:17:39,139
所以给定相同的状态空间，

2036
02:17:39,139 --> 02:17:41,540
 which direction you should search.

2036
02:17:39,139 --> 02:17:41,540
您应该搜索哪个方向。

2037
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:45,379
 So the same space, same state space.

2037
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:45,379
所以相同的空间，相同的状态空间。

2038
02:17:45,379 --> 02:17:48,099
 Then the sequence, the number of the visits,

2038
02:17:45,379 --> 02:17:48,099
然后是顺序，访问次数，

2039
02:17:48,099 --> 02:17:51,459
 the state visits will be different,

2039
02:17:48,099 --> 02:17:51,459
国事访问将会有所不同，

2040
02:17:51,459 --> 02:17:53,500
 if you use a different strategy.

2040
02:17:51,459 --> 02:17:53,500
如果你使用不同的策略。

2041
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:55,500
 So of course we should prefer the strategy

2041
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:55,500
所以我们当然应该更喜欢策略

2042
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:59,740
 which in the end, we can quickly find the answer.

2042
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:59,740
最终，我们可以很快找到答案。

2043
02:18:01,539 --> 02:18:05,019
 Sometimes it's a hybrid, meet in the middle.

2043
02:18:01,539 --> 02:18:05,019
有时它是混合体，在中间相遇。

2044
02:18:05,019 --> 02:18:07,539
 So you have starting from goal, for example,

2044
02:18:05,019 --> 02:18:07,539
所以你从目标开始，例如，

2045
02:18:07,539 --> 02:18:12,539
 forwards and then also from the, sorry, from data,

2045
02:18:07,539 --> 02:18:12,539
转发，然后也来自，抱歉，来自数据，

2046
02:18:12,539 --> 02:18:13,859
 and then also from goal,

2046
02:18:12,539 --> 02:18:13,859
然后也是从目标出发，

2047
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:15,900
 and then try to meet in the middle.

2047
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:15,900
然后尝试在中间见面。

2048
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:17,420
 So that is a hybrid one.

2048
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:17,420
所以这是一种混合型。

2049
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:24,580
 So yeah, so if you think those are the data available,

2049
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:24,580
是的，如果你认为这些是可用的数据，

2050
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:27,900
 and those are the goals, and then you go this direction,

2050
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:27,900
这些就是目标，然后你朝这个方向走，

2051
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:31,300
 or you go that direction, depends on the space.

2051
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:31,300
或者你朝那个方向走，取决于空间。

2052
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:33,460
 Same space we are talking about.

2052
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:33,460
我们正在谈论的同一空间。

2053
02:18:33,460 --> 02:18:38,460
 And then we can see which direction is more efficient.

2053
02:18:33,460 --> 02:18:38,460
然后我们就可以看到哪个方向更有效率。

2054
02:18:38,740 --> 02:18:43,500
 So this is talking about without much of the heretics,

2054
02:18:38,740 --> 02:18:43,500
所以这是在没有太多异端的情况下谈论的，

2055
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:47,340
 more about the exhaustive search.

2055
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:47,340
有关详尽搜索的更多信息。

2056
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:50,780
 Okay, so one example here.

2056
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:50,780
好的，这里举一个例子。

2057
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:55,260
 Confirm or deny the statements.

2057
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:55,260
确认或否认这些陈述。

2058
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:58,139
 Suppose your friend is called John,

2058
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:58,139
假设你的朋友叫约翰，

2059
02:18:58,139 --> 02:19:01,500
 and want to check whether he's,

2059
02:18:58,139 --> 02:19:01,500
并想检查他是否

2060
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:08,020
 Tom is his great, great, great, great, great, great father.

2060
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:08,020
汤姆是他伟大、伟大、伟大、伟大、伟大、伟大的父亲。

2061
02:19:09,620 --> 02:19:12,940
 So 10 generations apart, for example.

2061
02:19:09,620 --> 02:19:12,940
例如，相隔 10 代人。

2062
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:14,420
 We are checking that.

2062
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:14,420
我们正在检查这一点。

2063
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:19,060
 So one to confirm or deny.

2063
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:19,060
因此，需要确认或否认。

2064
02:19:19,940 --> 02:19:23,500
 So this is talking about 250 years ago,

2064
02:19:19,940 --> 02:19:23,500
所以这是在谈论 250 年前，

2065
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:25,580
 10 generations apart.

2065
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:25,580
相差10代。

2066
02:19:25,580 --> 02:19:28,900
 So we see Tom on the top is the data,

2066
02:19:25,580 --> 02:19:28,900
所以我们看到汤姆在顶部是数据，

2067
02:19:28,900 --> 02:19:32,540
 and then the goal is on the bottom is John.

2067
02:19:28,900 --> 02:19:32,540
然后目标在底部是约翰。

2068
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:37,540
 Okay, so we want to see whether this match there.

2068
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:37,540
好的，所以我们想看看这个是否匹配。

2069
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:40,940
 So which direction should we go?

2069
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:40,940
那么我们应该朝哪个方向发展呢？

2070
02:19:41,940 --> 02:19:45,100
 We are talking about the same search space.

2070
02:19:41,940 --> 02:19:45,100
我们正在谈论相同的搜索空间。

2071
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:51,500
 So suppose, yeah, Tom have three kids.

2071
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:51,500
所以假设，是的，汤姆有三个孩子。

2072
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:56,460
 And then each kids have another three kids, and so on.

2072
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:56,460
然后每个孩子还有另外三个孩子，依此类推。

2073
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:04,700
 And normally, each person will have two parents.

2073
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:04,700
通常，每个人都会有两个父母。

2074
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:08,500
 We don't talk about step parents or whatever.

2074
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:08,500
我们不谈论继父母或其他什么。

2075
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:11,340
 We just talk about two biological parents.

2075
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:11,340
我们只谈论两个亲生父母。

2076
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:16,420
 So which way you think is more efficient?

2076
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:16,420
那么您认为哪种方式更有效率呢？

2077
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:20,100
 10 generations apart.

2077
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:20,100
相差10代。

2078
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:30,660
 So if we start from data,

2078
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:30,660
所以如果我们从数据出发

2079
02:20:31,940 --> 02:20:34,180
 then we search three person, right?

2079
02:20:31,940 --> 02:20:34,180
那我们搜三个人吧？

2080
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:36,300
 I mean, depends on how many children they have.

2080
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:36,300
我的意思是，取决于他们有多少个孩子。

2081
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:39,460
 So suppose average, each person have three children.

2081
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:39,460
所以假设平均每人有三个孩子。

2082
02:20:40,779 --> 02:20:42,660
 Okay, so three.

2082
02:20:40,779 --> 02:20:42,660
好吧，就三个。

2083
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:46,500
 And then each of these have three.

2083
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:46,500
然后每个都有三个。

2084
02:20:48,179 --> 02:20:52,140
 So this is the first generation, second generation,

2084
02:20:48,179 --> 02:20:52,140
所以这是第一代、第二代、

2085
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:54,699
 third generation, fourth, 10.

2085
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:54,699
第三代、第四代、10代。

2086
02:20:55,580 --> 02:21:00,580
 So that is the number of the search you need to conduct.

2086
02:20:55,580 --> 02:21:00,580
这就是您需要进行的搜索的数量。

2087
02:21:01,220 --> 02:21:02,420
 To conduct, right?

2087
02:21:01,220 --> 02:21:02,420
进行，对吗？

2088
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:05,900
 Yeah, what if you start from here?

2088
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:05,900
是啊，如果从这里开始呢？

2089
02:21:08,980 --> 02:21:12,580
 Then parents, parents.

2089
02:21:08,980 --> 02:21:12,580
然后是父母，父母。

2090
02:21:12,580 --> 02:21:14,980
 Oh, I didn't draw another parent.

2090
02:21:12,580 --> 02:21:14,980
哦，我没有画另一个父母。

2091
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:22,380
 Yeah, so maybe, yeah, I didn't draw,

2091
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:22,380
是的，所以也许，是的，我没有画画，

2092
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:24,820
 say this is a parent.

2092
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:24,820
说这是父母。

2093
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:28,220
 Oh no, no, no, cannot be, this is children.

2093
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:28,220
哦不，不，不，不可能，这是孩子们。

2094
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:31,980
 So you have another parent, which is somewhere here.

2094
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:31,980
所以你还有另一个父母，它就在这里的某个地方。

2095
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:33,939
 So each one, you search the parents,

2095
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:33,939
所以每个人，你寻找父母，

2096
02:21:33,939 --> 02:21:37,260
 and then each search parents again, like that.

2096
02:21:33,939 --> 02:21:37,260
然后各自再次寻找父母，就像这样。

2097
02:21:42,099 --> 02:21:47,099
 Is this 10 generation will be the search ancestors

2097
02:21:42,099 --> 02:21:47,099
这10代会是寻祖吗

2098
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:50,900
 will be two to the power of 10, right?

2098
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:50,900
是 2 的 10 次方，对吗？

2099
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:52,539
 So if you're starting from data,

2099
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:52,539
所以如果你从数据开始

2100
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:56,900
 there will be average number of the children

2100
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:56,900
会有平均数量的孩子

2101
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:59,100
 to the power of 10.

2101
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:59,100
10 次方。

2102
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:04,779
 So depends on average number of children.

2102
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:04,779
所以取决于孩子的平均数量。

2103
02:22:04,779 --> 02:22:08,699
 If it's only one children, which way to go?

2103
02:22:04,779 --> 02:22:08,699
如果只有一个孩子，该走哪条路？

2104
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:14,900
 Everybody only have one child.

2104
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:14,900
每个人都只有一个孩子。

2105
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:21,500
 One, one, one, right?

2105
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:21,500
一，一，一，对吗？

2106
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:22,859
 Go this way, data driven.

2106
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:22,859
走这条路，数据驱动。

2107
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:27,180
 Yeah, but if it's three,

2107
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:27,180
是啊 但如果是三个

2108
02:22:31,620 --> 02:22:33,500
 then you have a three to the power of one,

2108
02:22:31,620 --> 02:22:33,500
那么你就有了 3 的 1 次方，

2109
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:37,100
 three to the power of two, three to the power of three,

2109
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:37,100
三的二的次方，三的三的次方，

2110
02:22:37,100 --> 02:22:39,940
 until three to the power of 10, right?

2110
02:22:37,100 --> 02:22:39,940
直到3的10次方，对吧？

2111
02:22:39,940 --> 02:22:42,220
 In order to find John.

2111
02:22:39,940 --> 02:22:42,220
为了找到约翰.

2112
02:22:44,140 --> 02:22:46,180
 So better go this way, right?

2112
02:22:44,140 --> 02:22:46,180
所以最好走这条路，对吧？

2113
02:22:46,180 --> 02:22:47,980
 Yeah, so this is the idea.

2113
02:22:46,180 --> 02:22:47,980
是的，这就是这个想法。

2114
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:51,820
 So if the n is greater than two,

2114
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:51,820
因此，如果 n 大于 2，

2115
02:22:51,820 --> 02:22:53,699
 so that means three, for example,

2115
02:22:51,820 --> 02:22:53,699
这意味着三个，例如，

2116
02:22:53,699 --> 02:22:57,260
 then it's better to do from the

2116
02:22:53,699 --> 02:22:57,260
那么最好从

2117
02:22:58,900 --> 02:23:03,300
 go to the backwards, okay?

2117
02:22:58,900 --> 02:23:03,300
往后走，好吗？

2118
02:23:05,060 --> 02:23:08,539
 But suppose we don't know,

2118
02:23:05,060 --> 02:23:08,539
但假设我们不知道

2119
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:15,619
 yeah, we don't know the,

2119
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:15,619
是的，我们不知道，

2120
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:21,300
 the parents.

2120
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:21,300
父母。

2121
02:23:24,940 --> 02:23:27,900
 We only have the, okay, come back to this.

2121
02:23:24,940 --> 02:23:27,900
我们只有，好吧，回到这个话题。

2122
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:32,420
 We only know a lot about each person who are their children.

2122
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:32,420
我们对每个人了解的只是他们的孩子。

2123
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:38,860
 Then looks like we don't have much choice, right?

2123
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:38,860
那么看起来我们没有太多选择了，对吧？

2124
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:40,060
 We have to go this way.

2124
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:40,060
我们必须走这条路。

2125
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:44,980
 Because each person probably don't know their parents.

2125
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:44,980
因为每个人可能都不认识自己的父母。

2126
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:47,220
 Anyway, yeah, it's a bit strange,

2126
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:47,220
无论如何，是的，这有点奇怪，

2127
02:23:47,220 --> 02:23:49,939
 but it's just, we are saying,

2127
02:23:47,220 --> 02:23:49,939
但我们只是说，

2128
02:23:49,939 --> 02:23:53,100
 depends on the situation, how much data you have.

2128
02:23:49,939 --> 02:23:53,100
取决于情况，你有多少数据。

2129
02:23:54,140 --> 02:23:56,020
 But efficiency wise, yeah,

2129
02:23:54,140 --> 02:23:56,020
但效率方面，是的，

2130
02:23:56,020 --> 02:23:58,220
 we look at which direction is better.

2130
02:23:56,020 --> 02:23:58,220
我们看看哪个方向更好。

2131
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:08,619
 So this is one about data driven, goal driven.

2131
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:08,619
所以这是一个关于数据驱动、目标驱动的问题。

2132
02:24:08,619 --> 02:24:10,740
 Then we can have a practice on this.

2132
02:24:08,619 --> 02:24:10,740
然后我们就可以对此进行练习。

2133
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:13,740
 This is our exercise two.

2133
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:13,740
这是我们的练习二。

2134
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:20,980
 So like goal play, okay, we play goal.

2134
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:20,980
就像进球一样，好吧，我们踢球。

2135
02:24:24,980 --> 02:24:29,980
 Goal play, should we go data driven or goal driven?

2135
02:24:24,980 --> 02:24:29,980
目标游戏，我们应该数据驱动还是目标驱动？

2136
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:32,740
 Or medical diagnosis,

2136
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:32,740
或者医学诊断，

2137
02:24:32,740 --> 02:24:34,820
 I mean medical diagnosis is easier,

2137
02:24:32,740 --> 02:24:34,820
我的意思是医学诊断更容易

2138
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:38,100
 like think about medical diagnosis.

2138
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:38,100
就像考虑医学诊断一样。

2139
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:39,539
 Which direction should we go?

2139
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:39,539
我们应该往哪个方向走？

2140
02:24:42,380 --> 02:24:44,220
 Data are those symptoms.

2140
02:24:42,380 --> 02:24:44,220
数据就是那些症状。

2141
02:24:45,220 --> 02:24:48,820
 The goal of those disease.

2141
02:24:45,220 --> 02:24:48,820
那些疾病的目标。

2142
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:52,020
 Okay, so suppose like a COVID.

2142
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:52,020
好吧，假设像新冠病毒一样。

2143
02:24:53,660 --> 02:24:58,580
 Then what kind of symptom can support this is COVID?

2143
02:24:53,660 --> 02:24:58,580
那么什么样的症状才能支持这是新冠病毒呢？

2144
02:25:03,260 --> 02:25:04,900
 So which way would be better?

2144
02:25:03,260 --> 02:25:04,900
那么哪种方式会更好呢？

2145
02:25:08,260 --> 02:25:09,539
 Can think about that.

2145
02:25:08,260 --> 02:25:09,539
可以考虑一下。

2146
02:25:10,539 --> 02:25:12,580
 Okay, okay, go back and think.

2146
02:25:10,539 --> 02:25:12,580
好吧好吧，回去想想。

2147
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:15,380
 I think today we had a quite long day already,

2147
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:15,380
我想今天我们已经度过了相当漫长的一天

2148
02:25:15,380 --> 02:25:16,220
 I should stop.

2148
02:25:15,380 --> 02:25:16,220
我应该停下来。

2149
02:25:17,740 --> 02:25:21,220
 Summarize first, okay, summarize what we had today.

2149
02:25:17,740 --> 02:25:21,220
先总结一下，好吧，总结一下今天的内容。

2150
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:27,140
 So other than the introduction about definition

2150
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:27,140
那么除了定义的介绍之外

2151
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:29,940
 and brief history, I think that is more

2151
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:29,940
和简短的历史，我认为这更重要

2152
02:25:29,940 --> 02:25:34,539
 just for your interest and basic idea.

2152
02:25:29,940 --> 02:25:34,539
只是为了您的兴趣和基本想法。

2153
02:25:34,539 --> 02:25:36,539
 And also your homework is to go back

2153
02:25:34,539 --> 02:25:36,539
还有你的作业就是回去

2154
02:25:36,539 --> 02:25:41,539
 and watch the YouTube about what is AI.

2154
02:25:36,539 --> 02:25:41,539
并观看有关什么是人工智能的 YouTube。

2155
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:43,580
 Okay, you can watch that.

2155
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:43,580
好的，你可以看看。

2156
02:25:43,580 --> 02:25:48,180
 And then the summary on the more technical stuff today

2156
02:25:43,580 --> 02:25:48,180
然后是今天比较技术性内容的总结

2157
02:25:48,180 --> 02:25:51,660
 we covered in the lecture two and three.

2157
02:25:48,180 --> 02:25:51,660
我们在第二讲和第三讲中介绍了。

2158
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:56,380
 Okay, so we want to define what is a symbolic AI.

2158
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:56,380
好的，我们想要定义什么是符号人工智能。

2159
02:25:57,580 --> 02:26:01,060
 And then what is a problem state, okay, problem.

2159
02:25:57,580 --> 02:26:01,060
然后什么是问题状态，好吧，问题。

2160
02:26:01,060 --> 02:26:03,620
 So we know in symbolic AI we need to come up

2160
02:26:01,060 --> 02:26:03,620
所以我们知道在符号人工智能中我们需要提出

2161
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:07,180
 with the symbols to represent the things.

2161
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:07,180
用符号来表示事物。

2162
02:26:07,180 --> 02:26:10,780
 And then we know what are the legal states,

2162
02:26:07,180 --> 02:26:10,780
然后我们知道什么是合法状态，

2163
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:12,500
 what are the legal movements,

2163
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:12,500
什么是合法的运动，

2164
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:15,500
 we need to define the rules, okay.

2164
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:15,500
我们需要定义规则，好吧。

2165
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:18,460
 And then come up with a state space.

2165
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:18,460
然后提出一个状态空间。

2166
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:20,860
 Yeah, so those are the first few things.

2166
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:20,860
是的，所以这些是首要的几件事。

2167
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:26,980
 For knowledge representation, yeah, overall in the AI

2167
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:26,980
对于知识表示，是的，总体而言在人工智能中

2168
02:26:26,980 --> 02:26:30,780
 can have a likely have a logic representation

2168
02:26:26,980 --> 02:26:30,780
可以有一个可能的逻辑表示

2169
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:33,260
 or you can have a graph representation

2169
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:33,260
或者你可以有一个图形表示

2170
02:26:33,260 --> 02:26:35,020
 or neural network representation,

2170
02:26:33,260 --> 02:26:35,020
或神经网络表示，

2171
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:37,180
 like the data driven stuff.

2171
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:37,180
比如数据驱动的东西。

2172
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:42,020
 But for symbolic AI, we most use,

2172
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:42,020
但对于符号人工智能，我们最常使用的是，

2173
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:44,420
 most popular one is using the graph,

2173
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:44,420
最流行的一种是使用图表，

2174
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:46,700
 okay, state space related.

2174
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:46,700
好的，状态空间相关。

2175
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:51,700
 Although previously was very much a pretty calculus, okay.

2175
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:51,700
虽然以前是非常漂亮的微积分，好吧。

2176
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:57,500
 Yeah, and then we talk about the theoretical graph theory

2176
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:57,500
是的，然后我们讨论理论图论

2177
02:26:58,580 --> 02:27:01,180
 can support us problem solving.

2177
02:26:58,580 --> 02:27:01,180
可以支持我们解决问题。

2178
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:04,860
 Then we talk about that that's why we have to use a graph

2178
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:04,860
然后我们讨论这就是为什么我们必须使用图表

2179
02:27:04,860 --> 02:27:06,980
 as a data structure.

2179
02:27:04,860 --> 02:27:06,980
作为数据结构。

2180
02:27:07,820 --> 02:27:09,420
 And then the terminology related to graph,

2180
02:27:07,820 --> 02:27:09,420
然后是与图相关的术语，

2181
02:27:09,420 --> 02:27:11,300
 I'm sure you understand that.

2181
02:27:09,420 --> 02:27:11,300
我相信你明白这一点。

2182
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:13,699
 And then we show you the example,

2182
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:13,699
然后我们向您展示示例，

2183
02:27:13,699 --> 02:27:15,340
 we show you the tic-tac-toe,

2183
02:27:13,699 --> 02:27:15,340
我们向您展示井字游戏，

2184
02:27:15,340 --> 02:27:18,619
 we show you the eight puzzle, 15 puzzle,

2184
02:27:15,340 --> 02:27:18,619
我们向您展示八个谜题、十五个谜题、

2185
02:27:18,619 --> 02:27:22,220
 we show you the farmer moving around.

2185
02:27:18,619 --> 02:27:22,220
我们向您展示农夫四处走动。

2186
02:27:22,220 --> 02:27:25,300
 Then we show we did exercise one,

2186
02:27:22,220 --> 02:27:25,300
然后我们展示我们做了练习一，

2187
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:27,660
 which is a jar, water jar.

2187
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:27,660
这是一个罐子，水罐。

2188
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:32,220
 Okay, then we have a highlight of the strategy

2188
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:32,220
好的，接下来我们来看看策略的亮点

2189
02:27:32,220 --> 02:27:35,380
 to go data driven or go driven.

2189
02:27:32,220 --> 02:27:35,380
是数据驱动还是数据驱动。

2190
02:27:35,539 --> 02:27:36,779
 And then we had exercise two,

2190
02:27:35,539 --> 02:27:36,779
然后我们进行了练习二，

2191
02:27:36,779 --> 02:27:39,820
 which is practice on that, okay.

2191
02:27:36,779 --> 02:27:39,820
这是练习，好吧。

2192
02:27:39,820 --> 02:27:43,220
 I think we had quite a lot covered.

2192
02:27:39,820 --> 02:27:43,220
我认为我们已经涵盖了很多内容。

2193
02:27:44,259 --> 02:27:45,099
 Are you all right?

2193
02:27:44,259 --> 02:27:45,099
你还好吗？

2194
02:27:46,619 --> 02:27:49,099
 Okay, yes, good.

2194
02:27:46,619 --> 02:27:49,099
好的，是的，很好。

2195
02:27:49,099 --> 02:27:53,740
 Okay, so go back and finish off the exercise two.

2195
02:27:49,099 --> 02:27:53,740
好的，回去完成练习二。

2196
02:27:53,740 --> 02:27:57,179
 We come back to check the answer next week.

2196
02:27:53,740 --> 02:27:57,179
我们下周回来检查答案。

2197
02:27:57,179 --> 02:28:01,699
 And then we continue discussion on the search algorithms.

2197
02:27:57,179 --> 02:28:01,699
然后我们继续讨论搜索算法。

2198
02:28:01,700 --> 02:28:06,140
 So we should be able to finish all the exhaustive search.

2198
02:28:01,700 --> 02:28:06,140
所以我们应该能够完成所有的穷举搜索。

2199
02:28:06,140 --> 02:28:09,620
 And then we can start to introduce the heuristic search

2199
02:28:06,140 --> 02:28:09,620
然后我们就可以开始介绍启发式搜索了

2200
02:28:09,620 --> 02:28:12,380
 after that, the week after.

2200
02:28:09,620 --> 02:28:12,380
之后，一周后。

2201
02:28:12,380 --> 02:28:16,060
 And then we start to talk about data mining, okay.

2201
02:28:12,380 --> 02:28:16,060
然后我们开始谈论数据挖掘，好吧。

2202
02:28:16,060 --> 02:28:18,580
 Okay, that's all for today.

2202
02:28:16,060 --> 02:28:18,580
好了，今天就讲到这里。

2203
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:21,300
 Anything else, any quick question?

2203
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:21,300
还有什么问题吗？

2204
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:25,460
 I got a question is talking about whether can form a team

2204
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:25,460
我有一个问题是在谈论是否可以组队

2205
02:28:25,460 --> 02:28:29,460
 with another group people in tomorrow class.

2205
02:28:25,460 --> 02:28:29,460
明天的课上还有另一组人。

2206
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:31,220
 Yes, the answer is yes.

2206
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:31,220
是的，答案是肯定的。

2207
02:28:31,220 --> 02:28:33,699
 Okay, thank you.

2207
02:28:31,220 --> 02:28:33,699
好的，谢谢。

2208
02:28:33,699 --> 02:28:34,859
 See you next week.

2208
02:28:33,699 --> 02:28:34,859
下周见。

2209
02:28:34,859 --> 02:28:38,460
