1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,200
 WHILE iT

2
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:09,200
 Okay, class.

3
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:21,400
 So today, actually, we have a very special lecture because first hour on my part, which

4
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:30,400
 is we can finish off all the exercises and then starting from 1.30, the prop time will take over.

5
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,400
 Okay, so prop time will take over the teaching to continue our discussions, the machine learning methods,

6
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,400
 including classification.

7
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:50,400
 And then next week, prop one will start to introduce a classroom and then prop time come back again from week 6 to week 10.

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:58,400
 Yeah, to introduce more machine learning algorithms and then prop one will come back again.

9
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,400
 Okay, so that is the arrangement.

10
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,400
 So today is a mix. You have seen two lectures today.

11
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,400
 Okay, so my last hour today, I think last week I made a mistake.

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,400
 I thought last lecture is Friday.

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,400
 Actually, that is only for the undergrad.

14
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
 Okay, only for undergraduate students.

15
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,400
 So I will say for undergraduate students, they are the last one, they will be there tomorrow last hour.

16
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,400
 Okay, so for us, this is the last class.

17
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:43,400
 So we can finish the two exercises we have not covered in topic 3 and then the three exercises in topic 4.

18
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
 And that is all for my part.

19
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,400
 Okay, then get ready for the quiz.

20
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,400
 So the quiz will be next Saturday, not this coming one, but next week.

21
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:04,400
 But so far, I haven't received your session information or your location, the venue yet.

22
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,400
 Okay, so still waiting for the school OIS team.

23
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
 They are making an arrangement now.

24
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
 So definitely one of those labs, definitely one of the session.

25
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
 For post-grad, you have two sessions.

26
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,400
 So those, you will be in one of these sessions.

27
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,400
 Okay, the undergrad will start from the earlier session.

28
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,400
 Okay, so I will make an announcement as soon as I get the list.

29
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:36,400
 Okay, so I got after I have the list, so you can see your the timing, the session number, as well as the venue.

30
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,400
 Okay, so please come the week after, I mean next week, next Saturday.

31
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,400
 Okay, that is one about the quiz.

32
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,400
 As we said, the quiz one is just a couple of my parts.

33
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,400
 So it's from lecture 1 to today, whatever, today is mainly about exercise.

34
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,400
 So today no new content, just exercise or whatever topic we covered.

35
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
 Okay, so that is the arrangement.

36
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,400
 Do you have any quick questions?

37
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,400
 Okay, so let's start to discuss the exercise 5.

38
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:23,400
 And that is one about the alphabet, alphabet of pruning.

39
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,400
 So that is a game, tree, and then we actually have the mini max.

40
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:35,400
 So we have a player and then you have their counterpart, so you have our opponents.

41
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,400
 So that's why we can use a mini max to play.

42
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,400
 So minimize our cost and then the opponent will maximize your cost and so on.

43
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,400
 So yeah, we can do mini max way, but then alphabet is a better version.

44
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,400
 So try to prune away some of the branches which is not going to help us.

45
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,400
 So that is key objective.

46
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:10,400
 And then, so you can see the, I tried to summarize, basically the relationship between alpha and beta.

47
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,400
 So you can make use of that to prune, remember.

48
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:22,400
 So if beta we already find the beta is too small, then you actually can prune away the branches below the beta.

49
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:30,400
 So compare with your parents, which is alpha, or your other ancestors if they are already available,

50
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,400
 if they are alpha value already available.

51
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,400
 And also, your alpha value is too big already.

52
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,400
 Your alpha value is too big than your parent's beta value.

53
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,400
 So in that case also.

54
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,400
 So this is a true type of alpha prune and beta prune.

55
00:05:51,400 --> 00:06:05,400
 So let's do the exercise.

56
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:16,400
 Okay, so for all the alpha nodes, the maximizer, the initial value should be negative infinity.

57
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,400
 All the beta value in the beginning very big.

58
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
 So it's a positive infinity.

59
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:28,400
 So we pre-put there already, attach to alpha, you just put the negative infinity,

60
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,400
 attach to beta value, you put the positive infinity.

61
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
 That is how we start.

62
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,400
 The alphabet depends on whether they ask us to do the pruning from left to right or right to left.

63
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
 We know this is to the left first.

64
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,400
 So starting from left branch first or starting from the right branch first, that would make a difference.

65
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:57,400
 But the difference is you probably one way is probably more efficient than another,

66
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
 but it really depends on the problem.

67
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
 So it's no guarantee.

68
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
 So that is the randomness here.

69
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,400
 Okay, so but for exercise purpose, we need to tell you, okay,

70
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,400
 if we don't say anything normally it's from left.

71
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
 Okay, it's from the left branch first.

72
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,400
 So that is how we start.

73
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,400
 And then we also starting from the depth first approach.

74
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,400
 So we go for the, so this one is from left to right.

75
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,400
 So that is the left branch first.

76
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,400
 So depth first, we get the value from here.

77
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,400
 So this value can be used to update here.

78
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,400
 So beta value will be updated by what?

79
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
 3.

80
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
 Yes.

81
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
 So we go, we do together.

82
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,400
 Okay, so this value will be updated by this terminal value here.

83
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
 Okay, so this is 3.

84
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
 So this is updated.

85
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
 And then we can compare.

86
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
 This is the beta value.

87
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
 So we should compare with alpha value.

88
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,400
 So are we too small?

89
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
 No.

90
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,400
 Yeah, if we're too small, this should cut, right?

91
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
 But it's not too small, meaning this branch should be checked.

92
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
 Yeah, so we need to check here.

93
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
 So here is 5.

94
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,400
 Okay, so 5 should be used to update the beta value.

95
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
 So this is the beta value.

96
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,400
 This is the minimizer, 3 and 5.

97
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
 Do we need to update?

98
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
 We don't.

99
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,400
 Okay, so are we done with this branch?

100
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
 Yes.

101
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,400
 Yes, so meaning what?

102
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,400
 This value can be used to update the alpha value now.

103
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,400
 Yes, so we get the alpha value.

104
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,400
 Okay, then another branch.

105
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,400
 So we are done with these two branches already.

106
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,400
 Then we come to here, the leftmost, so we get the zero value.

107
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,400
 So the zero value will be used to update the beta value.

108
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,400
 This is i, this is not i.

109
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,400
 Yeah, and then this beta should compare with school.

110
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,400
 Alpha value here, is that all?

111
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,400
 Any more alpha value?

112
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,400
 Yes, this one.

113
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
 Okay, we also need to compare with this one.

114
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,400
 This one already available, this is 3.

115
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
 So this one is minus.

116
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:31,400
 So we need to see whether the current beta value is at 2 to what?

117
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
 The beta value.

118
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,400
 Whether the beta value is too small.

119
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
 Right?

120
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,400
 It is too small meaning what?

121
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,400
 Meaning you don't have a chance to talk to your branch.

122
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
 Right, so you don't need to do further.

123
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,400
 So are we copying?

124
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
 Based on this, are we too small?

125
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
 No.

126
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
 But based on this?

127
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
 Yes.

128
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
 So this one?

129
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
 Cut.

130
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
 No need to do.

131
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
 No need to evaluate this branch.

132
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,400
 It doesn't don't care what is the value there.

133
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
 Okay, great.

134
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
 So remember this is a cut here.

135
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
 Although compared with this alpha, it's okay,

136
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,400
 but this alpha, you are too small already.

137
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
 Okay, so you should cut.

138
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
 And then this branch is done.

139
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,400
 So this should be used to update this value.

140
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,400
 So now we have the first alpha value for F.

141
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,400
 Okay, then alpha value should compare with beta value.

142
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
 So this is a beta value.

143
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,400
 Too small or too big?

144
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
 Are we too big?

145
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,400
 Because beta you should compare with to see whether you are too big.

146
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
 Right?

147
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
 Yeah, so not too big.

148
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
 This is still, this is possibly very big.

149
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
 So you are not too big.

150
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,400
 That means this branch should still be evaluated.

151
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 Yeah?

152
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
 No more other beta, right?

153
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
 No more other, this is alpha value.

154
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
 So no more other beta.

155
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:17,400
 Not to the other branch, your own parents, grandparents.

156
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
 So this site, we should continue.

157
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
 So we get five.

158
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,400
 What do we need to do next?

159
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,400
 This is a maximizer update.

160
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,400
 Yes, so this become five.

161
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
 Yes.

162
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,400
 Okay, so are we done with this branch?

163
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
 So we should propagate the value up, right?

164
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
 So this one should be updated.

165
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,400
 Get the value of five.

166
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,400
 Okay, now you have the value here.

167
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
 So this is a beta value.

168
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
 This is an alpha value we should compare, right?

169
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
 So are we too small?

170
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
 No.

171
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,400
 No, meaning we need to check here.

172
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,400
 Okay, if we are too small, no need to compare anymore.

173
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
 Okay, so we are not too small.

174
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
 That means we should compare this branch.

175
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,400
 So we go here and come here seven.

176
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
 So this is a seven.

177
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,400
 So first value seven.

178
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,400
 So then compare this alpha value with beta.

179
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
 Okay, don't compare this with this.

180
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,400
 You compare only alpha with beta or beta with alpha.

181
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,400
 So it's alpha here compared with this beta.

182
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,400
 So are we too big?

183
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
 We are too big.

184
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
 So what do we need to do?

185
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
 Do we need to do here?

186
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
 Cut.

187
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
 Cut, yes.

188
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,400
 Okay, so this seven and should use to update, right?

189
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
 Yeah, so this should propagate back.

190
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
 But are we updating?

191
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
 No, because it's a beta value.

192
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
 So yeah, five and seven.

193
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
 So remain as five.

194
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,400
 And then this one, are we, so you compare, still five,

195
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,400
 and compare with this alpha value.

196
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
 So are we too big?

197
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,400
 So are we too small?

198
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
 Because you are the beta.

199
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
 You compare with alpha.

200
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
 So if you are too small, alpha will not come to you.

201
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,400
 But we are not too small, right?

202
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
 So we are actually bigger.

203
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
 We have a chance to update.

204
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
 So what does that mean?

205
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
 We should continue this branch, right?

206
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
 Yeah, continue this branch.

207
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,400
 And now this value is four, right?

208
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
 Because beta, yeah, so four.

209
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:41,400
 And then alpha value, we are done with this whole branch now.

210
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,400
 Update, become four.

211
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,400
 Yes.

212
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
 We are done.

213
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
 Okay.

214
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,400
 So we cut off these two branches.

215
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,400
 And what is the end results tell us here?

216
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:08,400
 That means this maximizer should move to which branch?

217
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
 This one.

218
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
 Right?

219
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:19,400
 So if we go into the value, they should go this direction.

220
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,400
 Yeah, so that's all.

221
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
 We can double check.

222
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,400
 I mean, for the toy problem, yes, we can double check to make sure this is correct.

223
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,400
 You use full minimax using all the values.

224
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,400
 Although internal nodes, the utility value may not be identical,

225
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
 but the final results should be the same.

226
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,400
 The right branch to go to choose.

227
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
 Okay.

228
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
 Anything else?

229
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,400
 But the good thing is some branch you can cut off because it will not back your final selection

230
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
 of the branch selection.

231
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
 Doing the alpha beta.

232
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,400
 But for this toy problem, it doesn't make a big significant impact, it looks like.

233
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,400
 But if it's a very large game tree, it will create a difference.

234
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
 Okay.

235
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
 We can do it.

236
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,400
 Okay, we need to speed up a bit.

237
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,400
 And now, right to left.

238
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:23,400
 Don't worry, the solution will be available tomorrow after 12.30, 12.20.

239
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,400
 And together with exercise, additional exercise, the extra homework tool.

240
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
 I already make it available, right?

241
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
 Yeah, yeah.

242
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
 But the solution is available?

243
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
 Not yet, right?

244
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
 Yeah, so tomorrow.

245
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
 Okay, tomorrow.

246
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,400
 So you have time to work on your own and then check.

247
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
 Okay, quick one.

248
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
 The right to left.

249
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,400
 Meaning from this side, right?

250
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
 So four.

251
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
 So this is initial one.

252
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
 So yeah, actually four.

253
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,400
 So four will be useful update this one.

254
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
 And then compare.

255
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
 Okay, so we still continue.

256
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
 The eight.

257
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,400
 So eight will be useful update.

258
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,400
 This might be negative, it should be here.

259
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,400
 So here should have one.

260
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,400
 And then update it by eight.

261
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,400
 And then compare these two.

262
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,400
 So are we too big?

263
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
 This is four.

264
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
 And this is eight.

265
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
 Are we too big?

266
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
 Yes.

267
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
 Yes.

268
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
 Boom.

269
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
 Huh?

270
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
 Yeah.

271
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,400
 Okay, so we are done with this branch.

272
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
 And then this one.

273
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
 Five.

274
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,400
 So five compare with this.

275
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
 Too big.

276
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,400
 Can't pull.

277
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
 See, this is five, right?

278
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
 Five.

279
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
 And then this is alpha.

280
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
 This is beta.

281
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,400
 So should we go here?

282
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
 No.

283
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,400
 Cut.

284
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
 So are we done with this?

285
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,400
 So this we have value for.

286
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
 And then we come here.

287
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
 Five.

288
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
 This will be five.

289
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,400
 Should we do here?

290
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,400
 We compare this with this.

291
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
 Should we continue?

292
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
 Yes.

293
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
 Right?

294
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
 Because yeah, we are, you are the alpha.

295
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
 I'm the beta.

296
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
 Okay.

297
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
 So I'm bigger than you at the moment.

298
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
 So you should continue.

299
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
 Yeah, so continue.

300
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
 So this is three.

301
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,400
 So do we need to update?

302
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
 Yes or no?

303
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
 Yes.

304
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
 Yeah, this is beta.

305
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
 Yes.

306
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
 So three.

307
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,400
 And then update.

308
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
 No.

309
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
 Okay.

310
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
 And end results.

311
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
 Go this way.

312
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
 Correct?

313
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
 Same.

314
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,400
 Yeah, but it's just, if you do this way, it looks like we pull it away more.

315
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
 Right?

316
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
 Compare from the left to right.

317
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
 Same, same thing.

318
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
 But the end results is the same.

319
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
 Okay.

320
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
 Any quick question?

321
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
 Done?

322
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
 Okay.

323
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,400
 And also this one.

324
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
 Left to right first and then right to left.

325
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
 You also see difference.

326
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
 Right?

327
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
 So we have one more time.

328
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,400
 Should we go left to right or right to left?

329
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
 Left to right.

330
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
 So press six.

331
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
 Okay.

332
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
 So we have six.

333
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
 And then nothing yet.

334
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
 So no need to just continue on.

335
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
 So this is two.

336
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
 So two and then still six.

337
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
 Right?

338
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
 Because I'm maximizer.

339
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
 So six will be useful.

340
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
 Update here.

341
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
 Okay.

342
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
 So we have six.

343
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
 Okay.

344
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
 So we have six.

345
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
 Okay.

346
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
 So we have six.

347
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
 So six will be useful.

348
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
 Update here.

349
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
 And then should we continue this?

350
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
 Most likely yes.

351
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
 Right?

352
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
 Because those are the initial haven't got anything yet.

353
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
 So again six, three here.

354
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
 Okay.

355
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
 Should we continue?

356
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
 This is a maximizer.

357
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
 Minimizer.

358
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
 Yeah.

359
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
 So we should continue.

360
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
 So there are three.

361
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
 So we have three here.

362
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
 Okay.

363
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
 So we have three here.

364
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
 And then three will be updated.

365
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
 So here is three.

366
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
 And then three will be used to update this one.

367
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
 So we come three.

368
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
 And then come to this side.

369
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,400
 And then you have the three here.

370
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
 And this is the same.

371
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
 Same up to up.

372
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,400
 I mean it's either we cut or don't cut.

373
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
 Okay.

374
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,400
 Although in my guide here given is probably you can cut.

375
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,400
 But no, we cannot compare this three with this three.

376
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
 Yeah.

377
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,400
 We should compare this three with this.

378
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
 Okay.

379
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
 So we should still continue with this nine.

380
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,400
 And then nine will be used to update this value.

381
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
 And then this is our first.

382
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 Should we continue?

383
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
 Yeah.

384
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
 So we should still continue.

385
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
 So four.

386
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
 And then four.

387
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
 And to compare with this.

388
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
 No, compare with this.

389
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
 Right.

390
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
 Compare with this.

391
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
 So we are smaller.

392
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
 So we should still continue.

393
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
 So seven.

394
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
 So seven update.

395
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,400
 And then this is seven.

396
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
 Use a minimizer.

397
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,400
 So that's why we come seven.

398
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
 And maximizer.

399
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,400
 That's why this becomes seven.

400
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
 And we finish this branch.

401
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
 That's why we have seven here.

402
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
 And then come to this end.

403
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,400
 So we have these two.

404
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,400
 And then this maximizer should compare with the minimizer.

405
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
 Right.

406
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
 So yeah, we are still small.

407
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,400
 So that's why we should continue this branch and still two.

408
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,400
 Still two can use to update this one.

409
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
 And these two.

410
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 And then we compare with this one.

411
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
 Right.

412
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
 Maximizer.

413
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,400
 So here zero.

414
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,400
 And then with the minimizer, we still small.

415
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
 So we should continue.

416
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
 So cannot cut.

417
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
 Right.

418
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
 So we have four.

419
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,400
 And then four should be used to update.

420
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
 Four.

421
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,400
 And then minimizer, no update.

422
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
 So now done with the whole branch.

423
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,400
 There are update here.

424
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
 Yeah.

425
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
 Okay.

426
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
 So yeah.

427
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
 So still small.

428
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
 So we should continue this branch.

429
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,400
 Do you get any prune at all for this one?

430
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
 You get prune?

431
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,400
 From left to right?

432
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,400
 Left to right, do you have any prune?

433
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
 So far no prune yet, right?

434
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
 Have you finished?

435
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,400
 Any of you finished already?

436
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,400
 Did you prune, managed to prune anything?

437
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
 Okay, quick, quick.

438
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
 Let's finish.

439
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
 So two.

440
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
 And then we have eight.

441
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
 We have six here.

442
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,400
 So this is alpha.

443
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
 This is beta.

444
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,400
 So no prune, continue here.

445
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
 Maximizer, so eight.

446
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
 Right.

447
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
 So we have eight.

448
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,400
 Then we have eight here.

449
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
 And this is eight.

450
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,400
 So this is the maximum alpha is two.

451
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
 So we should still continue this branch.

452
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
 Right.

453
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
 So it's four.

454
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,400
 And this is a minimizer.

455
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
 Another minimizer here.

456
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,400
 So we still smaller than any of the minimizers.

457
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
 So we still continue here.

458
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
 Six.

459
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
 So update.

460
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,400
 And then minimizer six.

461
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,400
 And maximizer six.

462
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,400
 Minimizer six.

463
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
 Right.

464
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
 No prune.

465
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
 Agree?

466
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
 Okay.

467
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,400
 Left to right, no prune.

468
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,400
 Right to left.

469
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
 Right to left.

470
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,400
 So here, six.

471
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,400
 Then four.

472
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
 Maximizer, so nothing.

473
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
 Go up to here, six.

474
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:22,400
 And then this branch is eight.

475
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
 Okay.

476
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
 We are eight.

477
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
 And beta is six.

478
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
 Can prune?

479
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
 Yes.

480
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
 Yes.

481
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
 We can prune.

482
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
 We need to check this.

483
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
 Yes.

484
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
 We are done with this branch.

485
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
 So this six from here.

486
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,400
 Then come to this branch, which is four.

487
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
 And then this four.

488
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,400
 Can we do anything?

489
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
 No, we compare with this.

490
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
 Right.

491
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
 Compare with this and this.

492
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
 So we are still small.

493
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,400
 So we should still continue.

494
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
 So zero.

495
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
 This maximizer, so no change.

496
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,400
 And then finally we are updating this branch.

497
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
 So it's four.

498
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,400
 And this is six.

499
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
 Okay.

500
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
 This is four.

501
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
 Can we do anything?

502
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
 Cut.

503
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
 Cut.

504
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
 Yes.

505
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
 Okay.

506
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
 So you see?

507
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,400
 So this six now done.

508
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
 With the whole branch.

509
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,400
 So this six is used update.

510
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
 And come to this branch.

511
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
 Four.

512
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,400
 This maximizer.

513
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
 Minimizer is six here.

514
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,400
 Can do anything?

515
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
 Cut.

516
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
 Cut.

517
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
 Yes or no?

518
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
 Yes.

519
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
 Yes.

520
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
 We are the maximizer.

521
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
 You are the maximizer.

522
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
 Yes.

523
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
 Yes.

524
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
 We are the maximizer.

525
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
 You are minimizer on top is six.

526
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
 So we are too big already.

527
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
 Right.

528
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
 So no need to check.

529
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
 This branch no need to check.

530
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
 Okay.

531
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,400
 So if this done, then we will update this seven.

532
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
 And then you compare with this.

533
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
 Yeah.

534
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
 Still need to continue.

535
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
 So nine.

536
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
 And nine.

537
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
 Am I too big now?

538
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
 Yeah.

539
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
 You are seven here.

540
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
 So nine too big already.

541
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
 No checking.

542
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
 Okay.

543
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
 So now seven finished.

544
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,400
 So this can be used to update.

545
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,400
 So can you see something?

546
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
 Yeah.

547
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
 So cut or not?

548
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
 Cut.

549
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
 Cut.

550
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
 How nice.

551
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
 Yeah.

552
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
 For this one we can cut more.

553
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
 Okay.

554
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
 From the right to left.

555
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
 So although it is exactly same part.

556
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,400
 But we have no clue whether we should go left to right or right to left.

557
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
 Okay.

558
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,400
 So that is just by luck.

559
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,400
 So one way probably more efficient than the front time to time.

560
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,400
 So the best probably, yeah, just take the chance.

561
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,400
 So at least you have the chance probably to cut some of the branches.

562
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
 Okay.

563
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
 Okay.

564
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
 You know how to do this.

565
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
 Okay.

566
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
 So yeah.

567
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,400
 The results will be valuable soon.

568
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,400
 And for then we can, we are done with topic three.

569
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,400
 Topic four, the main things summarized here.

570
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
 Okay.

571
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
 So association reminding three measurements.

572
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
 One is the support.

573
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,400
 One is the competence and the lift.

574
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
 Okay.

575
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
 So that is three things, measurements.

576
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,400
 And sometimes we call support count.

577
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
 There is a number of counting.

578
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,400
 Sometimes we call support and some percentage.

579
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
 Okay.

580
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,400
 So the next factor is what is just a frequency and other ones probably.

581
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
 Okay.

582
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,400
 And so basically we need to find a frequent pattern.

583
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,400
 That means those patterns which is occur very frequently.

584
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,400
 So we need to pay attention to it.

585
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,400
 Then we need to pay attention to those rules based on each of the interesting pattern.

586
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
 Okay.

587
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
 Now frequent pattern.

588
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
 Okay.

589
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:13,400
 We will say frequent pattern because interesting or not later will be used lift to measure.

590
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,400
 So we should show generate the rules and then to see the rule hopefully the rule is strong

591
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,400
 and interesting and we pick them.

592
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
 Okay.

593
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,400
 Then we use these rules to help us to make decision.

594
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
 So that is the key thing.

595
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,400
 Then in order to find a frequent pattern, we have two algorithms.

596
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,400
 One is a query and the other one is EP goals.

597
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,400
 And so you can see this is a efficient version of this one.

598
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
 Those should give us the same answer.

599
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
 Okay.

600
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,400
 So a quick discussion about the first question.

601
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,400
 The association rule mining pattern.

602
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
 Okay.

603
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,400
 So we are talking about almost 30 years ago.

604
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
 Yeah.

605
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
 The Barbie, they find the rules.

606
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
 Okay.

607
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
 So we have a question.

608
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
 Okay.

609
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
 So what is the rule?

610
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
 Okay.

611
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
 So what is the rule?

612
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
 Okay.

613
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
 So what is the rule?

614
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
 Okay.

615
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
 So what is the rule?

616
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
 Okay.

617
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
 So what is the rule?

618
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
 Okay.

619
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,400
 So, almost 30 years ago, yeah, the Barbie, they find the supermarket always.

620
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,400
 You know, every 20 seconds, you will get the Barbie.

621
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
 People will buy that.

622
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
 Okay.

623
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,400
 And also 60% likely wherever they buy Barbie, they also buy candy.

624
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
 Okay.

625
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
 Candy bar.

626
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,400
 So then what should we do?

627
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,400
 So this is what is the, what does this information tell us?

628
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
 What does this information tell us?

629
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,400
 So this is something to do with the room.

630
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,400
 Wherever they buy the Barbie, they also buy candy.

631
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,400
 So that is 60% likely.

632
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,400
 So that is a confidence of such room.

633
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:02,400
 Every 20 seconds they will buy the Barbie.

634
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
 Meaning what?

635
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:10,400
 Meaning every minute they will buy three customers will buy the Barbie.

636
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
 That's a lot.

637
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:19,400
 So whoever and also 60% they will likely, whoever they buy Barbie, they also buy candy.

638
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
 So that is the room.

639
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,400
 And then the pattern is quite significant.

640
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,400
 Every three minutes we will have...

641
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,400
 Sorry, every minute.

642
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,400
 20 seconds you will have this purchase.

643
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,400
 So that means every minute we have three purchases.

644
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
 So it's quite significant.

645
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,400
 So we are saying the support is quite high.

646
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
 Our support count is very high.

647
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,400
 Support count is every minute we have three.

648
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
 This kind of purchase.

649
00:29:53,400 --> 00:30:01,400
 So what can we do?

650
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,400
 So probably put them together to easy assess.

651
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
 I probably have a special promotion.

652
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
 I have the whole bundle.

653
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:16,400
 So the whole bundle, whoever buys Barbie also buys candy, they have a special discount.

654
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:26,400
 So those are the very useful business room can be applied to increase the purchase.

655
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,400
 To increase the sale.

656
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,400
 Okay, so this is just for fun.

657
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,400
 And discussion, I don't know whether you go back and think about this.

658
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,400
 So association, yeah, that is a typical example in the supermarket.

659
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,400
 Or as I said, you can have a targeted advertisement.

660
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:58,400
 So whoever buys the textbook of data mining, they likely also buy the textbook of the database or cloud, AWS, those books.

661
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
 You can actually target it.

662
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:07,400
 Whoever buys this, you will send the advertising to those customers.

663
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:14,400
 So those are association rule mining.

664
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,400
 You can use as an example.

665
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,400
 What about regression?

666
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,400
 I think most of you are in signal processing.

667
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,400
 So regression is something which you are very familiar with.

668
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
 So I'm processing the function.

669
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
 So that is the regression.

670
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:39,400
 So we want to build a model and this model can make use of the features and then can predict one of the features or one of the other features.

671
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
 So that is the regression.

672
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,400
 So it's a function approximation kind of classification.

673
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,400
 You can also say predict the label information.

674
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,400
 Not the function value, but actually the label.

675
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,400
 Which category you are predicting?

676
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
 So that is classification.

677
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:04,400
 Clustering is more based on the object itself and similarity measure.

678
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,400
 And then grouping based on their similarity.

679
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,400
 Group, group, group, categories.

680
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,400
 So classification normally we talk about the object.

681
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
 You already have the label.

682
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
 You know the label information.

683
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,400
 So you can build a model more easily because you are training.

684
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,400
 You can make use of the label information.

685
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
 For clustering, do we have the label information?

686
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
 Don't have.

687
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
 So that is the key difference.

688
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,400
 Okay, you can come up with any example which makes sense.

689
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
 We'll do.

690
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,400
 So again, this is just for your information.

691
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,400
 I mean for your one of the possible answers.

692
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,400
 Okay, then a priori.

693
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,400
 We already said scan, scan, you know, many times scan.

694
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
 So here is a detailed algorithm.

695
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,400
 So she's able to run the algorithm here.

696
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,400
 Okay, and then try to generate the candidates.

697
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,400
 And then for each of the candidates, check whether subset update is not frequent pattern.

698
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
 It is not prune away.

699
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
 Otherwise, finally, they are strong candidates.

700
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:13,400
 Then go search, scan through the entire transaction database to work out what is their support count.

701
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,400
 Then if it's above the threshold, we should take it.

702
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,400
 If it's below, look.

703
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,400
 Right, so that is the idea.

704
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,400
 Okay, and then the FP grows.

705
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
 Yeah, so basically build a tree.

706
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,400
 Build a frequent pattern tree.

707
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:41,400
 And then from there, try to, for each of the items in the header table,

708
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,400
 you go create their own conditional pattern tree.

709
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,400
 Okay, and then from there, you collect the,

710
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,400
 concatenate everything together to form the entire frequent pattern.

711
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
 So you don't have candidates.

712
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
 You don't have candidates.

713
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
 Basically, you only consider frequent pattern.

714
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
 You just see how much you can grow.

715
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
 Okay, so for each conditional pattern base,

716
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,400
 I mean for each frequent pattern, they must be a,

717
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,400
 must be a frequent pattern in the conditional pattern base.

718
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,400
 Okay, then possibly can combine with the,

719
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:26,400
 the item, the frequent item together to form a longer, longer item set.

720
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,400
 Okay, frequent item set.

721
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,400
 Okay, so this is the exercise.

722
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:40,400
 We ask you to use both FP grows and also use apirari.

723
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
 Okay, so we should get the same answer,

724
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,400
 but we just have a different practice.

725
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,400
 Okay, so let's try the FP grows first.

726
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,400
 And so you don't know how to do it.

727
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:59,400
 So for each of these, and then we first thing is we need to identify frequent patterns.

728
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
 So we sketch through whole thing,

729
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,400
 and then we get the frequent pattern list based on their,

730
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,400
 their, their, their frequency.

731
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
 And then we only pick.

732
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,400
 So here, actually suppose we should have another column.

733
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,400
 So those are really the frequent pattern kind of one item set,

734
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
 which is frequent.

735
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
 Right, so we sort it again.

736
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,400
 So suppose A is the eight of it.

737
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
 So A is the highest.

738
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,400
 So we still have the A and then B.

739
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,400
 B is also, actually ABCDE offers still frequent pattern.

740
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
 So that's why it's exactly same.

741
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,400
 Like no, no difference because no item is removed.

742
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
 Right, so this is what we have.

743
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
 Now that that we construct.

744
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,400
 So, so this is what we scan the transaction database and we work out the frequency.

745
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:58,400
 And so ABCDE is all, because the minimum, minimum count here is two.

746
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,400
 So minimum support count is two.

747
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
 So we all above.

748
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,400
 That's why none of the one items that will be removed.

749
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
 Okay, and then we sort it.

750
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,400
 So we get this one items and then those are the accounts.

751
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,400
 And then for each of these, we re-sort this.

752
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,400
 So actually basically still AB and still BCD, you know, so still, still the same.

753
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,400
 So we have this, this is also still the sorted, sorted, frequent patterns.

754
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
 Right, okay.

755
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,400
 And then for each, we should go and construct our tree.

756
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,400
 So is that something like this constructed?

757
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
 Okay, so this is the sorted, frequent patterns.

758
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,400
 So the A and B, that's why you have A and B.

759
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,400
 And then you have BCDs or this branch, BCD, you know, like what we did.

760
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,400
 And then every time you scan through, then the number here increased.

761
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,400
 Whatever transaction, how many transactions in content is A, then you increase by one.

762
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,400
 Right, so this is the final tree constructed.

763
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
 Same as yours.

764
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
 Yes.

765
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,400
 Okay, and then you should have a header table.

766
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,400
 So header table is one weekend items set, items.

767
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
 And then this is an account.

768
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:21,400
 And this is a pointer pointing to the first notes in this tree.

769
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,400
 Right, so I haven't finished.

770
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,400
 For example, A should pointing to here.

771
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
 I will be very messy.

772
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,400
 A will point to here, then B will first be pointed.

773
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
 Then the B should connect with their B.

774
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,400
 So this B should connect to here and so on.

775
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,400
 Okay, so here I just focus on, for example, D connect to the first D.

776
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
 And then the D should connect together.

777
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,400
 Okay, and then the E, so E is here.

778
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,400
 Then E connect together.

779
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:57,400
 Okay, and then for each of these, we should go continue to construct your own conditional pattern base.

780
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,400
 And then from there construct your own frequent list.

781
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:12,400
 Or you want to have your own FP3, conditional frequent pattern tree.

782
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,400
 Okay, so that's looking to the E.

783
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
 Okay, so we're looking to the E.

784
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,400
 So actually we should do everything for, I mean for each of these.

785
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
 So we should do for A.

786
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,400
 A do what we get now.

787
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
 Right, empty.

788
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
 So that's it, no more.

789
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,400
 Yeah, for B, we should have the A5, right?

790
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
 And then also another B.

791
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
 Another B is empty.

792
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,400
 Okay, so that's what we get.

793
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
 And then for C, we should have, we should have.

794
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,400
 Okay, now let's look at what D, what D we go here.

795
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,400
 So what do we have?

796
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
 Conditional pattern base.

797
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,400
 Okay, I have this.

798
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,400
 So this is looking to the conditional pattern base for E.

799
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,400
 So for E, we will have ACD, right?

800
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
 ACD, so that's the first one.

801
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:21,400
 And then we have the AD, also for the D, we should have the DNC.

802
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,400
 Yeah, so this is the conditional pattern base.

803
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,400
 Ending with E, okay?

804
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
 So this is the one.

805
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,400
 And then from this, we actually work out what is the frequent pattern in this conditional pattern base.

806
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,400
 Okay, so A is A a frequent pattern.

807
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
 Yes, A equal to what?

808
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
 Two, right?

809
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
 Here and here.

810
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,400
 Yeah, so that's A for B, only one.

811
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
 Yeah, B only one.

812
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,400
 C, we have one here, one here.

813
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
 So C is two.

814
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,400
 D, you have one here, one here.

815
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
 So it's two.

816
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,400
 Okay, so meaning B will be removed.

817
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:12,400
 Okay, and then we rewrite this word become ACD and AD and C because B will be removed.

818
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
 B will be removed.

819
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:20,400
 So you become here and then you should construct your conditional pattern, frequent pattern three.

820
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,400
 Okay, so use this now, using this to construct your tree.

821
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,400
 So this is my tree construct it.

822
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:35,400
 You see, ACD, ACD, and then AD, so A increased and then D and then C.

823
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,400
 Okay, so I construct this tree and then D should connect together, C should connect together,

824
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,400
 having your header table and then pointing to this tree.

825
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,400
 And then for each of these, you should combine with the E, you get your own conditional pattern base again.

826
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,400
 Okay, so that is, you see, ending with E and then now it's a D.

827
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,400
 And this is ending with E, now it's a C.

828
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,400
 And then ending with E, now it's an A.

829
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:09,400
 So this is, for each of these, you get your own conditional pattern base and go recursively construct your FP tree.

830
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,400
 Okay, so for this one, okay.

831
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:19,400
 D, now it's under the conditional E, then now it's a D, okay, D.

832
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,400
 So for D is what? AC, right, so that's why AC.

833
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,400
 And then another D is here, so it's A.

834
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,400
 Okay, so then A we have two, C have one, so C can be removed.

835
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
 So we only have A2.

836
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,400
 Okay, so A2, then your tree will be like this, A2.

837
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
 Okay, so meaning what?

838
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:50,400
 Meaning A2, A together with D together with E and with the frequency of two.

839
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,400
 This is one frequent pattern.

840
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,400
 This is that, this one.

841
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,400
 Right, so this is this one.

842
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
 And then we are looking at the C.

843
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,400
 So C, you only have A.

844
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
 So A will be removed.

845
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
 So this one no more.

846
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
 So this one, no frequent pattern.

847
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,400
 That means you don't have something like a CE with A.

848
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
 It's not, right?

849
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,400
 The A is only one, A already removed.

850
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
 So no more tree.

851
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,400
 Yeah, similarly for A, A also.

852
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,400
 A, yeah, it's just empty, so no tree.

853
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:35,400
 Okay, so this ending with E, only the one with the DE have a frequent pattern, which is this.

854
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,400
 The others are zero already.

855
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:46,400
 Okay, so that's why ending with E, we only have one which is DE, this is the one.

856
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,400
 Then the rest is just this, this.

857
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:56,400
 Right, so it's A, E, C, E, DE, A, E, C, E, DE.

858
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,400
 So this is the final frequent pattern, identified it for this continuity pattern phase.

859
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
 Okay, clear?

860
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,400
 That is very serious for us to do it manually, but it's very easy for computer, right?

861
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,400
 Just recursively concurrently they can do it.

862
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,400
 Okay, so this is E, we only did one for E.

863
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,400
 Then similarly we can do it for D.

864
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,400
 Okay, so this is details for doing it for D.

865
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,400
 So you see the D, D have several of it.

866
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,400
 That's why your continuity pattern base is very long.

867
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:44,400
 You see, you have C, A, A, B, C, A, B, C, and then you have AB, AB is this D.

868
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,400
 Yeah, you have AC, you have A, you have BC, and then finally you need to tidy up.

869
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,400
 Okay, so there you construct your tree like this, and then for each of these you should continue to do it.

870
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,400
 Okay, so that is the ending and results.

871
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:09,400
 Okay, we don't have time to go through everything, but I hope you know the principle and you can double check with the answer later.

872
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:17,400
 Okay, so this is related header, and then there are three, and this is related to this part, and there are three and so on.

873
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:24,400
 So this is the final frequent pattern, we identified it, or ending with D.

874
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,400
 Then similarly, ending with C.

875
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:36,400
 Yeah, so this also you can, if you prefer to look at the tree together with the conditional pattern base,

876
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,400
 and also look at the one frequent pattern.

877
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:50,400
 Now, so this is, you know, if you want to tabulate it, but it's not really that helpful because for each you should go search for the frequent pattern within that conditional pattern base.

878
00:44:50,400 --> 00:45:05,400
 Okay, so this is one, in the end, we have 19 of it, so that is individual, and this is related to one ending with E, related with ending with D, and so on.

879
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,400
 Okay, so 19 of it.

880
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,400
 You should, we should get exactly same thing by using a plurary.

881
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
 Okay, so this is a plurary.

882
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:21,400
 Yeah, one item set, so all of them are the frequent pattern, that's why it's also equal to L1.

883
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:31,400
 Then you get the candidates, and then you see, you know, BE, for example, you go for COMPTS, and then you find this too low, can be removed.

884
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:38,400
 Then the C2, self-join with C2 to get L2, and L2 you also check, sorry.

885
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:47,400
 So C2, after removed the lower, I mean the infrequent pattern, then you get L2.

886
00:45:47,400 --> 00:46:04,400
 Now to self-join with L2, you get C3 prime, and then you check whether some of them, like ABE, for example, BE itself is not frequent pattern already, so this is, can be pulled away, right away.

887
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:12,400
 Then the rest you go check the COMPTS, and then some will be pulled away again if the COMPTS is lower than 2, right?

888
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
 So that's how you continue.

889
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,400
 So exactly same thing, in the end you also get the 19 of it.

890
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,400
 Okay.

891
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:30,400
 And so the last question is discussed about the, to check whether this, if we already know this is a frequent pattern,

892
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,400
 and we know this rule is not strong, and we ask what other rule can be proven.

893
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,400
 So we are talking about this rule is not strong, okay, so actually those would be, can be proven.

894
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:49,400
 Basically, just based on the principle, calculate the confidence value for the rule, okay,

895
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,400
 so you should see the answer, confidence value.

896
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:07,400
 And so if we want to extensively discuss it, this is a one, so we have this rule, and then, so if this is a pattern, frequent pattern, then all the possible rule, this can be listed here, right?

897
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,400
 2 to the power 4 minus 2, yeah, so those are the rules.

898
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:20,400
 And then we actually can treat each of these as a header, the rest as a tail, you know, then we can calculate.

899
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:31,400
 So for this one, yeah, basically just to see how the relationship between the minimum confidence, okay, that's all.

900
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,400
 And yeah, so that's about it.

901
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:43,400
 Okay, for this one, let's consider for example here, yeah, we know this one, so this rule, that was a confident value of this rule.

902
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,400
 I mean, how to calculate it.

903
00:47:47,400 --> 00:48:03,400
 It's a support of the entire thing, right, ABCD, yeah, ABCD, divide by what?

904
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:13,400
 Divide by the support of the header, right, so the header is B and C, yeah.

905
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:21,400
 So we know this value is less than the minimum confidence, right?

906
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:29,400
 Yeah, so actually I already talked about this in the class, so minimum confidence, we less than this.

907
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,400
 Okay, so what about the confidence, how to calculate this confidence?

908
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:53,400
 Also ABCD, right, then divide by the same numerates, then the denominator is equal to C, yeah.

909
00:48:53,400 --> 00:49:11,400
 So if we know this is less than, so of course this will be less, yeah, because the support of BC should be greater than, sorry, smaller than support of the C, right, yeah.

910
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,400
 Okay, so that's why this can be proven.

911
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:26,400
 Okay, so that's all for my part, and confidence should come by 130, so you can have 10 minutes break and totally refresh your way, these things,

912
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:33,400
 and then you can start to learn more about machine learning, more numerical way,

913
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:43,400
 but actually you can start with decision tree, so still kind of commercial AI kind of, okay, yeah.

914
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,400
 Okay, that's all, yeah, thank you.

915
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:54,400
 So for the mini project, I think Prof. will tell us more later.

916
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,400
 Also we will share two sessions for the questions related to it.
