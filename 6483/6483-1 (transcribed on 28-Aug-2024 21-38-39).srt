00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,040
 Hello class, can you hear me alright psychedelic music?

2
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:47,519
 Hello class. Can you hear me all right behind? Cannot hear me? Can you?

3
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:57,520
 Hello everyone. Welcome to this class. Okay, this is actually very first time we offer this course to postgraduate students.

4
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:09,520
 It's really very well overwhelmed. Okay, so that's why this is the additional class we opened in the last minute.

5
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:19,520
 I'm glad you can all make it. Okay, so my name is Chen Li Hui and I'm your first lecturer for this course.

6
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:29,520
 We have this teaching team here, three of us. So I'm teaching the first 13 hours followed by Prof Tan.

7
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:45,520
 So he's going to cover more on the numerical or neural network or the current numerical data driven based kind of AI or machine learning.

8
00:01:46,520 --> 00:02:02,520
 Then followed by Prof Wen. That is again, he's talking about the mix. He has both the symbolic base and also numerical base approach and also some training methods and so on.

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:11,519
 Okay, so I'm the one to cover the more conventional approach. Okay, so that means symbolic AI.

10
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:30,519
 Okay, so my part is more about the symbolic AI. That means it's not totally data driven. Okay, that means you actually have to come up with abstraction, use the symbols to represent the things, not totally data based on data to drive, come up with a representation.

11
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:41,520
 Okay, then from there you actually rely on certain skills or the search algorithms to find the solution. Okay, so that is my part.

12
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:51,520
 And also I'm going to cover the data mining, which again is more conventional approach rather than nowadays totally data driven kind of approach.

13
00:02:51,520 --> 00:03:08,520
 Okay, but as an introduction course, it's good to have both. Okay, so maybe in the future when you design your system, you can actually mix those together, make use of certain principles for the design of the new models and then for the data driven approach.

14
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:28,520
 Okay, okay, so here is our contact just in case you need to get in touch outside the class contact hour. And also we have two TA here. Oh, actually, yeah, yeah, at moment is two, we hopefully we have more. Okay, but at moment we only have two of them.

15
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:45,520
 And they are contacted here. Likely they will get involved. We will get them involved in later stage. One is a marking of the subsea. Another one is about hand on project. Okay, so we have one group project.

16
00:03:45,520 --> 00:04:05,520
 So we want you to form a group of three members to work on project. Actually, that is the difference between the undergrad group and the post grad group, mainly about this project. Okay, so your project would be slightly different.

17
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:22,520
 The requirement would be different. So please form the teams with your peers. Okay, so with your same category students to form a group of three to work on the project. Okay, undergrad, they will be undergrad groups.

18
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:40,520
 Okay, so this group forming, we are going to share a Google Doc later. And then you can actually after you decide your groups, you can just fill in the name and also the group number. Okay, platform is prepared for that.

19
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:57,520
 And I think probably hopefully next week will be available. Okay, although the project issue won't start until probably week six. So it's no hurry, but it's good to have a form form a group as early as possible. So we can start to discuss things and work together. Okay.

20
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:16,520
 Yeah, the TA later probably will help you to have some hands on or actually, we will schedule some sessions for you know, for your Q&A. But we haven't finalized this yet, because everything is, is very new is last minute kind of thing. Okay, so we will do it.

21
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:45,520
 So we will do it. Hopefully next week, I need to discuss with profitable and trade he went for conference last week and they just came back. So we need to set settle everything. And then we will keep you informed. Okay. And this is our learning outcome. So you can see basically, we want to learn something about the state space representation. As I said, that is a more symbolic based approach. And then strategies for the search. And for the search,

22
00:05:46,520 --> 00:06:15,520
 there are two big category. One is exhaustive search. Okay, so is a systematically uninformed way to search through the space if we have enough space and also enough computational resources. Okay, so that is one type of search. Another one type of search is with hints. Okay, so that is a heresy based search. So we're going to cover this. And then also another topic, which is a special branch of the AI, which is doing the data mining.

23
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:43,520
 So we want to take out the pattern from a mountain of data. Okay, use association mining. So that is some four topics here. I'm going to cover. Although I only put one line here as you know, objective to learn the machine learning models and algorithms. But this one actually come cover several weeks on that. Okay, so profit times part and problems part mainly about that part. And then lastly, we also touch about, you know, the possible application.

24
00:06:46,520 --> 00:07:14,520
 Okay, so this is the hopefully we as an introduction, we are, we are exposed to these topics, and hopefully we can understand these things. And some of you may continue your research developments in this area. Okay, so this is what we hoping. And yeah, so no single book can cover this right. So those references and also our lecture slides and homework is already in the description.

25
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:43,520
 We uploaded to our course website for post grad. Yeah, so you just looking to the 24 s one, the EE for six, six, four, eight, three. Okay, for undergrad, they are IE for for for for H3. Okay, so and also, I believe some of the post grad actually we're sitting with undergrad tomorrow, right, tomorrow morning, but it's a very small group of people.

26
00:07:43,520 --> 00:08:06,520
 But our recorded lecture will be uploaded to the EE six, four, H3 only for post grad. And then undergrad will be in IE. Okay, it's the same. Actually, it's the same contents and the same teaching team. So it's just a different timing. Okay, so different timing. So one this this is a new class additional class.

27
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:29,520
 Okay, copyright for the materials. So this is really strict for your own use only. Okay, NTU properties or cannot distribute it. Please aware that. Okay, so that's why actually our notes is so called so called. Yeah, it's password protected, right. So you need to put the password to open it. Okay.

28
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:58,520
 Okay. Okay. Yeah, about the schedule and assessment. So you can see the green one. Yeah, so that is your class. Okay, so this is a newly added this class today from today. Okay, so Thursday, and then the another group is for undergrad, which is tomorrow morning. For assessments, okay, basically 40% on the continuous assessment. Okay, so what are the 40%?

29
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:21,520
 Two homework assignments, one quiz. Okay, so homework assignment only 5% each. So two of it. And then you have a quiz. So for my part, mainly about the quiz, okay, 10%. I'm going to give you some exercise, but that so called exercise or home is homework is not going to be assessed.

30
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:50,520
 Okay, so just purely for your exercise only, okay, practice only. So that one, I will upload it like tomorrow. I mean, this weekend, I will upload so we can work on something. And we are going to upload the answer as well. So it's purely for your practice. So for my part, basically just a practice and then attend the quiz. Okay, but for procton and problem parts, we have the homework each okay for each of them.

31
00:09:51,520 --> 00:10:16,520
 That's a homework. And they also combine everything together by two mainly they are part for the project, okay for the project. And that is a group project for 20%. Take 20% for that group effort. Okay, so we are going to release project requirements later. Okay, so we're still revising it and then try to finalize everything.

32
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:38,520
 And suppose is applied those machine learning methods. So it's definitely from week five later, okay, because procton will come in in the second in the last two hours in week five. Okay, so my 13 hour cover all the four, four weeks plus one hour in the week five. Okay.

33
00:10:39,520 --> 00:11:06,520
 And then the final exam 60%. So you see, this is a strict, strict restricted open. Okay, so basically you can bring piece of a four sheets. Okay, you can write as many things on top of as you can write as much as possible. Okay, double sided and can print in whatever size you can have tiny, tiny, tiny size. That's okay.

34
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:21,520
 Okay, so you can have everything on that so called cheat sheets, right? Yeah, so we can have that bring in. And then, of course, we are not going to set some question which easily can copy from your sheets, right? Okay.

35
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:43,520
 So, so this is restricted open for the final exam. Okay, two hours only. Okay, two hours, two hours, two hours. So actually, basically, this course, post grad is very similar requirement as undergrad. But we do have a slightly more challenging for you for on the project side. Okay, so that 20%.

36
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:54,520
 Okay, so that is arrangements so far. Any questions? Do you have any quick questions? I can answer. Yes.

37
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:14,520
 Different class meaning? Tomorrow only post grad. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Yes, same category. Because post grad, the requirement will be different from the undergrad. Okay, so if you have friend having a class tomorrow, but they are post grad. Yes, no problem. Okay.

38
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:39,520
 Yes. And also likely we have to rely on your own computer to do the project. Okay, we are not able to provide the GPU, maybe only GPU. But, you know, the computation resources, probably not. Okay, yeah, be prepared. But not very challenging. I mean, toy problem, not very big, huge data or whatever. Okay.

39
00:12:39,520 --> 00:13:01,520
 Okay. And we probably can have some shared accounts in the MLT, but but that one depends on depends CC whether it's really someone needed. And then we will see. Okay. So so so we probably have some dedicate some time for the TA to help. If you have a quick question. Yes.

40
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,520
 Yes.

41
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:11,520
 Well, why you take this?

42
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:21,520
 Okay, I don't know. You can try the first week you can drop. If you find you cannot really follow. Okay.

43
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:31,520
 You. It's not compulsory. This is free. Okay. Yes. Anything else?

44
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:53,520
 Yeah.

45
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:16,520
 Okay.

46
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:45,520
 So as I said, I'll give you some extra exercise, but for purely for practice, no marking, no assessment. Okay. So my part, actually, I probably give you twice. I give you one, which is about representation learning one about search. Okay. So for your practice only, and then come back for the quiz. So the quiz, this is a tentative schedule. Okay. Likely is in the end of the week five. That means a Saturday. Okay. But this need to be confirmed by the school because we need to be confirmed by the school. Okay.

47
00:14:46,520 --> 00:15:06,520
 So this is a big venue. We need a computer and this will be on the ISIS system. Okay. So we need the main power to do it in regulation. So I haven't got confirmation yet. Okay. But just book your calendar. Okay. So likely is that Saturday. If it's not that Saturday will be the week after. But try to book this. Okay.

48
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:35,520
 Okay. Look, this, I try to push for this one. Okay. And then after that, then, yeah, basically profit time take over this, this, oh, yes. And two of them were swapped. Okay. So profit time cover two hours and then follow problem will come back to talk about unsupervised learning. And then because profit time need to go for overseas trip. So so so so that's why these two weeks they were swapped.

49
00:15:35,520 --> 00:16:05,520
 So week 10 week six swap. And now that that's profit time come back, continue everything. And then until the week 10 then perform takeover. Okay. So this is arrangement. And then for the homework, homework one likely is this. Okay. So again, this is up to them to to when to release a question and the required for the deadline. Okay. So this is just for reference. Likely week one. Sorry. Homework one homework two. And then the project day one. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay. So this is just for reference. Okay

50
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:29,260
 Time when And you'll get yet I haven't checked. I think is early December. Okay. Okay. Any question. So this is a schedule 드�وبиик

51
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,460
 So this is a schedule.

52
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,240
 Topic-wise is tentative, I mean from week five later.

53
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,180
 I think it's about there, but they can change.

54
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,380
 Depends on some special arrangements.

55
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,220
 Okay.

56
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,300
 Okay, then come back to my part.

57
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,280
 So I'm your first lecture.

58
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,980
 I'm going to cover symbolic AI basically,

59
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,500
 together with data mining.

60
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,220
 Okay, so this is what we are going to cover

61
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,380
 for this part one.

62
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,860
 So we have part one, part two, and part three.

63
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,380
 So my part one, four topics.

64
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,500
 Okay, so today we talk about introduction

65
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,460
 and very, very, very brief history.

66
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,860
 And then I need to move on to the second topic,

67
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,500
 which is talking about representation.

68
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,020
 Okay, symbolic representation.

69
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,020
 And also show you what is the key technique

70
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:27,139
 or the procedures for symbolic base, symbolic AI.

71
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,180
 Okay, so basically you need to do the abstraction,

72
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,620
 come out with the symbols, representation.

73
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,100
 Then you have to have a search rules

74
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,460
 to say what are the legal movements.

75
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,340
 Okay, then thirdly, how to manipulate it.

76
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,660
 Okay, so this is a thing.

77
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,220
 So I need to cover this today.

78
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,540
 Data structure, the most common use one,

79
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,700
 is a graph, a tree, a special graph.

80
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,860
 And then the strategy.

81
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,820
 So we don't talk about specific one,

82
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,380
 but the overall strategies for search

83
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,900
 is either data-driven or goal-driven.

84
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,140
 Okay, data-driven, that means forward.

85
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,500
 And goal-driven, backwards.

86
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,860
 Okay, so that is overall strategy.

87
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,780
 And then next week onwards,

88
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,180
 we can talk about the specific search algorithm.

89
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,300
 Okay, so we need to cover quite a lot today.

90
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,260
 Okay, let's see the time.

91
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,620
 Okay, I think, okay.

92
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,100
 So that is the first file.

93
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:38,899
 And this is my lecture one.

94
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,900
 Okay, so you can see, yeah, four topics, how we arrange.

95
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,700
 Okay, so this is, I try to follow the schedule.

96
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,620
 Okay, again, my introduction.

97
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,940
 Yeah, actually I'm from computer background,

98
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,460
 computer science, and also I did my PhD in neural network.

99
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,620
 Okay, that was long, long ago.

100
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,980
 I joined NTU 30 years ago.

101
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,060
 Okay, I joined NTU 30 years ago.

102
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,780
 I joined NTU 30 years ago.

103
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,220
 Okay, I was the first one teach neural network in school,

104
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,300
 in the school.

105
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,820
 And guess how many student we have?

106
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,820
 At that time,

107
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,060
 10, yes.

108
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,060
 Yeah, 10 to 15, okay, for undergrad.

109
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:34,580
 But those are really, really, really keen learner.

110
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,260
 Okay, so actually it's very fun to teach with them.

111
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,260
 Very small class, and very, we go through derivation together,

112
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,740
 and many of them actually work in this area after that.

113
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,699
 Okay, but that was long, long ago.

114
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:49,139
 And then the class become bigger, bigger.

115
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:50,980
 Actually later I introduced the data mining,

116
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,860
 but data mining become more popular.

117
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,699
 And then later then we adapt into the deep learning,

118
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,020
 and then we have the CNN, we have the other methods.

119
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,300
 So that's how the course evolved.

120
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,660
 Okay, so yes, we starting from about 10 students,

121
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,379
 and now look at the class.

122
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:13,100
 And this is for post-grader class,

123
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,100
 and then undergrad we also about 260, 270 students.

124
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,139
 Okay, so yes, become very big,

125
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:26,139
 and I'm all the time actually was in computer science school

126
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,220
 from my undergrad, and then I moved to Scotland

127
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
 for my post-grad.

128
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,540
 But when I joined NTU, it's the first time

129
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,060
 I come to a school of triple E,

130
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,100
 because at that time they even don't have

131
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,780
 a school of computer science.

132
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,220
 Actually NTU only have a division of material

133
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,940
 and computing or something.

134
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,780
 Yeah, so but actually our school

135
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,260
 have information engineering,

136
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,620
 so it's more related to computer courses.

137
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,180
 That's why I'm teaching like software engineering,

138
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,540
 database, and AI and data mining,

139
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,700
 and the introduction to data science and AI,

140
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,580
 those computing related courses.

141
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,659
 But I don't really know much about the signal processing,

142
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,659
 and also signal systems, yeah, no, no,

143
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:19,740
 hardware, no, no, no, not me.

144
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,139
 Okay, yeah, so very, very lucky, very fortunate

145
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:24,500
 actually I'm teaching this course,

146
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,139
 and this is also my research area,

147
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,659
 and very closely related, so it's really fun

148
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,060
 to have this course keep updating the knowledge

149
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,580
 in this area and also doing the research in this area.

150
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,820
 Okay, so this is a very quick introduction about myself.

151
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,180
 Okay, so what we are going to cover today

152
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,980
 in the first lecture, so you see the outline,

153
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,420
 okay, just look at this slide.

154
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,420
 Firstly, ask yourself, what is AI?

155
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,660
 Okay, what is AI?

156
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,180
 Okay, ask yourself, what is AI?

157
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,740
 The AI, this term becomes so popular, so what is it?

158
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,820
 What is it?

159
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,620
 We can, yeah, probably the entire course,

160
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,580
 we try to answer this question, what is AI?

161
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,900
 And also, what is the most popular algorithms,

162
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,940
 and what is AI try to address, or try to do?

163
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,540
 And then why, why we want to do it?

164
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,180
 Okay, yeah, I'm sure you have many answers

165
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,540
 why you want to do it.

166
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,220
 Like, many of you are using chat GBT, are you?

167
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,580
 Yeah, try to get answers for various questions

168
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,980
 you have in mind, yeah, it's very good.

169
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,659
 You know, you can use this as a tool to help us to learn.

170
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:45,300
 So that is a way to enhance our understanding

171
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,820
 or our learning, right?

172
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,020
 And also, yeah, so we want to ask why.

173
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,220
 And then also, is there any very specific

174
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,380
 common objective for AI?

175
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,100
 Or is there, don't have a universal kind of way

176
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,660
 to define it?

177
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,660
 It depends on the application, depends on the perspective.

178
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,220
 And then very, very brief history of the AI,

179
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,180
 and then some major applications.

180
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,020
 Okay, then those are the key terms,

181
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,540
 so hopefully we'll be more familiar with these terms later.

182
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,980
 You probably ask yourself why we talk about gameplay?

183
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,180
 Why gameplay is, play game, why the game design

184
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,980
 is related to AI?

185
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,740
 And why theory prove is related to the AI?

186
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,940
 Why?

187
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,940
 But now we all talk about language and standing is AI, right?

188
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,899
 But you see which one is much more challenging

189
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:47,420
 for computer to do it.

190
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,540
 That's why we start from easy one,

191
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,980
 start from something which is symbolic AI can handle.

192
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,340
 That means we can come out with the abstraction,

193
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,100
 to describe, use a symbol to describe things,

194
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,899
 and then we rely on the logic to do the reasoning, inference.

195
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:09,379
 So that is how we started.

196
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:13,340
 And then now move on to the much more sophisticated way.

197
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,899
 We move on to data driven, totally data driven.

198
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:18,100
 We don't know how to represent it.

199
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,980
 Let machine learn to represent it.

200
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,419
 Okay, so this is a very big move.

201
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,500
 So what is AI?

202
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,939
 What is AI?

203
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:38,060
 Probably a very general definition is try to say,

204
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,060
 is human attempt, or our attempt to build models of ourself.

205
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,899
 We want to build a model of ourself.

206
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,340
 Ourself can do what?

207
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,260
 Can do thinking, reading, speaking,

208
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,300
 make decision, adaptation, right?

209
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,820
 Many things have strategies,

210
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,220
 huge knowledge from somewhere, we can learn very fast.

211
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,020
 Those things, yeah, we are building model, try to do that.

212
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,100
 Okay, but what about those movies?

213
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,620
 The early things, yeah, those are the science fictions.

214
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,179
 That is not really the robot can really do that.

215
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,459
 That is a simulation, right?

216
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:31,459
 Like the Terminator actually was the one,

217
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,379
 like imagine human body actually can combine

218
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:42,139
 with other material, and then become,

219
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:45,300
 the human become, or robot become more powerful, right?

220
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,419
 And can do some tasks.

221
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:49,820
 Actually, we are moving to that direction,

222
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,460
 but it's still a fiction.

223
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,300
 And then we move on to something which is actually human,

224
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,980
 no, the robot actually can have emotion.

225
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,980
 Okay, so it's also one step closer to mimic human, right?

226
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,820
 Yeah, and those are the emotion,

227
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,379
 and can have dream as well.

228
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:13,540
 I don't know how many of you already watched those movies?

229
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,139
 Probably two old, one of those movie are two old.

230
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,300
 Okay, so based on Professor Elin Rich,

231
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:27,379
 actually she's a professor, I think is the first author

232
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,700
 wrote, I mean, first textbook in AI was wrote by her.

233
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:38,540
 So that's why I want to get the definition from her.

234
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,899
 It's a very general, but it's true,

235
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,100
 our attempt to build models of ourselves.

236
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,620
 Okay, so that is AI, and then this is from a Google,

237
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,500
 Jiminy, Jimini, you see, that is how they define,

238
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,340
 they say AI is a field of computer science,

239
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,300
 workers are creating intelligent machine

240
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,300
 that can mimic human cognitive functions.

241
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,020
 Okay, so this is, you can also use ask chat GBT,

242
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,659
 what's AI, see how they answer, how they define it.

243
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,780
 Okay, so basically, what we've tried to do is,

244
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,780
 we try to build something, model or machine or robot.

245
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,899
 They can do something which at moments,

246
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,139
 probably human can do better.

247
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:27,100
 Most likely human can do better,

248
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,180
 but we want to build something which can either compatible

249
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,940
 with us or certain task that can exceed us.

250
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,860
 Okay, so for some tasks, for example,

251
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,540
 they probably can run very fast,

252
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,700
 which is a speed beyond human, right?

253
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,780
 Or they can actually handle many, many tasks concurrently

254
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,420
 and so on, okay, so that is something probably

255
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,100
 can do better than us, but many other cognitive ability,

256
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:00,100
 hopefully they can kind of reach or compatible with us.

257
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,140
 Okay, so yeah, today homework, okay,

258
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,860
 go back, watch those YouTube, they try to talk more,

259
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,540
 that is a very professional way to talk about,

260
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:15,860
 try to define what is AI, okay.

261
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,340
 Here a few key points is,

262
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,820
 it's study and design intelligent agents

263
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,899
 and agent actually able to interact with the real world

264
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,820
 and also reasoning, planning and also learning adaptation.

265
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,500
 And maybe we should add more, like even decision making.

266
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,100
 Yeah, they actually can, like those have to make decision,

267
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,060
 they can, especially some game, those actually,

268
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,060
 Dota 2, for example, they have to play

269
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,300
 with five members play together,

270
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,340
 so they have a collaboration,

271
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,340
 so it's already kind of beyond that, okay.

272
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,700
 So other definitions, yeah, again from Professor Alienrich

273
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,500
 and Calvin Knight, that is their textbook,

274
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,140
 yeah, they try to say AI is a study of how to make computer

275
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,500
 do things at which a moment people are better, okay,

276
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,060
 we are better, now we try to make a computer

277
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,780
 can do things which at moments we are better,

278
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,380
 so hopefully they can, as I said,

279
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,380
 make the machine compatible or even better, okay.

280
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,740
 And the Strahd Russell and Peter Novik,

281
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,940
 actually these two professors,

282
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,780
 they are another conventional AI textbook written by them,

283
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,060
 okay, also more symbolic before, okay,

284
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,140
 but of course the textbook also evolved.

285
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,140
 So as I said, AI has to do with smart programs,

286
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,940
 so let's get on writing, so that was very old way, right,

287
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,420
 they actually rely on writing the program to do it,

288
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,980
 but now it's not really,

289
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,700
 now it's a lot to do with data driven, right,

290
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,500
 but we need to have a good model

291
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,660
 that any data can fit in, okay,

292
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,340
 but that was beginning, yeah, we define actually,

293
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,420
 believe the AI is very much still in the hands

294
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,440
 of the programmer or designer, okay,

295
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,140
 so the designer is the one decide the life

296
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,300
 or decide how capable your machine can be,

297
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,060
 so that's why they rely on the code.

298
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,900
 Okay, then the latest one,

299
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,060
 Extra Taylor, actually he's the CEO of the X company,

300
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,659
 so he said the AI is attempt to make computer

301
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:41,500
 do what they do in movies, okay,

302
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,419
 in the movies was animation, assimilation,

303
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,179
 but now it's a real thing,

304
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,560
 you build the real thing can really talk,

305
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,560
 really, really robot can really talk like a human,

306
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,280
 right, can walk around and can do some performance

307
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,940
 or cook dinner for us, you know,

308
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,820
 that is no longer assimilation, it's not a fantasy,

309
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,659
 it's a real thing, they build a machine can do that,

310
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:10,659
 okay, so that is, and yeah, so like in a movie

311
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,460
 what they have, they have a dream and they have conscious,

312
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,020
 you know, they have emotion, they can learn,

313
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,860
 they can do dream force learning

314
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,060
 and they can integrate the bio-metrical,

315
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,179
 you know, those things into material,

316
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,220
 into the human body, okay,

317
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,980
 that is something what we aim to do now,

318
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,140
 and why, okay, so we know, okay, why is AI,

319
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,020
 AI is about building a machine to do things

320
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,500
 human can do better at moments, okay,

321
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,780
 then why we want to do that?

322
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,140
 Firstly, we probably don't know how we learn, right,

323
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,760
 but can we build something which is better than us?

324
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,140
 Still possible, right, it's like we know birds can fly

325
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,980
 and we probably don't know exactly the birds,

326
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,380
 the how they fly, the how they actually fly,

327
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,500
 but we can build airplane, can fly, okay,

328
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,900
 so we are having a working principle there

329
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,480
 and we are not rebuild another birds,

330
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,580
 but as long as we can achieve the similar functionality

331
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,600
 as a bird, okay, so this is possible, right,

332
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,300
 so that's why actually we are talking about,

333
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,740
 although we don't really completely know

334
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,419
 how human learns and how we do things,

335
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:38,419
 but we can still try to see how to achieve the level,

336
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,100
 like what we did for the language understanding,

337
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,100
 totally data-driven, okay, and the algorithm is very simple

338
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,980
 and then totally algorithm, data-driven,

339
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,659
 use a simple algorithm, actually we build something

340
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,660
 which is so powerful, looks like very human, right,

341
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,940
 looks like they really understand,

342
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,540
 although not sure, not sure they really understand or not,

343
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,020
 but looks like they understand it, okay,

344
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,140
 so you see two things, one is actually,

345
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,380
 even we don't know, but we can use this computer power

346
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,460
 or algorithms or methods or build models

347
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,620
 actually to enhance our thinking, okay,

348
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,860
 there another point is to understand how we think,

349
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,139
 because with that help, even we don't know in advance

350
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:28,580
 how we know, how we think, how we do,

351
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,300
 but we use a simple model to simulate it

352
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,379
 and then we try to refine the process

353
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:38,899
 and then probably the outcome,

354
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:41,620
 it will be very close to what we expected

355
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,620
 and then we can, you know, we can revise it

356
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,620
 and reinforce it, so that is a procedure, okay,

357
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:55,939
 so that's why we do need to know,

358
00:33:55,939 --> 00:33:58,580
 we don't need to know everything to start,

359
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,739
 we can start from somewhere

360
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:04,100
 and then we try to enhance our understanding

361
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,480
 and also try to help us to understand, okay,

362
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,940
 so this is by Herbert Simon,

363
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,100
 actually this is considered as one of the funding father

364
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:20,100
 of AI, although he got no better price in economics, okay,

365
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,460
 but he really made a lot contribution in various ways,

366
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,259
 so he was the one actually tried to understand

367
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:31,219
 how decision making, human understanding, you know,

368
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,900
 he tried to make contribution in that,

369
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,020
 that's why it's more theoretically,

370
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,739
 he made a lot of contribution to AI, okay,

371
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:42,339
 so like what he predicted, you see, in 1965,

372
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,020
 he already said machines will be capable

373
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,420
 of doing any work a man can,

374
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,780
 yeah, it's going to be like that, right, machine, machine,

375
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,980
 yeah, so yeah, definitely it's a fusion of technology,

376
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,340
 all kinds of things fusion together,

377
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,100
 so this is called, the AI actually is considered

378
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,980
 as an industry revolution, that's why you are all here,

379
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,820
 you are interested to know more and don't miss out,

380
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,700
 okay, so next, so we know what is, and then we know why,

381
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,700
 and then next is objectives, okay,

382
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,180
 so we will say, actually don't necessarily have

383
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,180
 a very fixed set of universal agree upon the objectives,

384
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,740
 but we can look at from different perspective,

385
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,260
 and then you can design the AI in that direction, okay,

386
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,260
 so look at the horizontally,

387
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,580
 you want the, one side is very human,

388
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,700
 that means very emotional driven,

389
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:48,140
 probably not as logic or not as rational as a machine,

390
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,980
 for example, right, so that direction is a human,

391
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,220
 horizontally another direction is about rational,

392
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,740
 and then vertically is about thinking or is about acting,

393
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,860
 okay, so we can partition this into these four areas,

394
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,500
 and then you can see, for example,

395
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,700
 you want the machine to can think very humanly,

396
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,260
 and then thinking wise, very thinking like a human,

397
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,100
 then you need to have a lot emotion,

398
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,460
 you wanna design a machine, have emotion,

399
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,460
 have these attachments or have this recognize

400
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,660
 the facial expression, and also more like a human,

401
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,660
 but if it's more like rational,

402
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,580
 then it's more rule related,

403
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,580
 so actually, you have the rule reasoning,

404
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,620
 and then you can have this like the rule before,

405
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,580
 long, long ago, yeah, which is more like a chess play,

406
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,779
 which is more based on the rule based,

407
00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:50,500
 okay, symbolic related, yeah, so yeah,

408
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,500
 so this, if acting wise, action wise,

409
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,259
 yeah, you want to be acting like a human,

410
00:36:57,259 --> 00:37:01,700
 then you can like what we had, chat GBT now, right,

411
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:06,859
 have this way to talk, and like us, right,

412
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,460
 and also can pass a tooling test,

413
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,540
 so what is tooling test?

414
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,220
 Tooling test means the person ask questions,

415
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:21,020
 so behind the scene have machine, computer, program,

416
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,779
 another is a real person, okay,

417
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:24,339
 but I ask the same question,

418
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:26,859
 then these people give me answer,

419
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:29,339
 then if I cannot tell who is machine,

420
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,820
 who is a real person,

421
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:35,020
 that means the program pass a tooling test, right,

422
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,740
 yeah, so I think nowadays,

423
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,780
 do you think the chat GBT can pass tooling test?

424
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,780
 Yeah, I think most of the time,

425
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,140
 they can answer very well,

426
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,140
 you can't tell this is from,

427
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,860
 if you don't look at it,

428
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,580
 you probably cannot tell,

429
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,780
 is from machine, or actually is from a real person,

430
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,980
 real expert give you answer, right,

431
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,500
 so that's why they talk about,

432
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,460
 we need to revise,

433
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,100
 they say the tooling test is already out of date,

434
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,060
 so we need to redefine it, okay,

435
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,300
 we probably need to define it in a way,

436
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,460
 yeah, I have one slide,

437
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,460
 talk about the, give them $100,000, US dollars,

438
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,540
 and then go do the investment,

439
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,340
 and then see whether you can make money,

440
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,140
 if you can, then you pass a tooling test,

441
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,260
 so you want to test the overall ability,

442
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,380
 knowledge, and how to apply those knowledge,

443
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,860
 in the real action,

444
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,740
 so it's no longer just answer questions,

445
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,700
 not just like a test your knowledge,

446
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,940
 which is can be described it,

447
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,140
 and then can be pre-trained it, right,

448
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,580
 you cannot, not like that,

449
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,020
 more uncertainty involve,

450
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,060
 more decision making involve,

451
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,460
 much more challenging,

452
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,420
 so that they are talking about that,

453
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,020
 and also, I don't know,

454
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,900
 they say they are going to write a book on that,

455
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,180
 but not sure whether it's published or not,

456
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,060
 okay, yeah, human intelligence,

457
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,500
 and artificial intelligence,

458
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,100
 okay, so just like I said,

459
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,140
 yeah, so birds,

460
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,419
 actually we build the airplane,

461
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:09,060
 but may not be,

462
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,060
 it's not really reproduction of the birds,

463
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,259
 so we just use the working principle,

464
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:18,500
 and then human vision and computer vision,

465
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,940
 this can be different,

466
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,740
 we don't really understand how exactly

467
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,220
 human eye processing information,

468
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:28,939
 our neural network model can do that,

469
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:31,819
 and looks like they can process the model,

470
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:34,180
 they can identify faces, for example,

471
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,540
 they can actually create even fake face, right,

472
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,740
 it's construct something,

473
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,100
 yeah, and then human brain,

474
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,620
 and artificial neural network,

475
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,939
 yeah, artificial neural network

476
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:47,700
 is definitely try to mimic our brain,

477
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,020
 from structure wise,

478
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,580
 they try to build a small,

479
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,620
 very, very simple processor,

480
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,540
 which is like a mimic ourselves in the brain,

481
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,460
 and then they believe each cell connect to many massively,

482
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,380
 connect to many, many others,

483
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,819
 and then we have a lot of such kind of simple cells,

484
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,380
 and then when they combine together,

485
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,980
 they have this huge computational ability, right,

486
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,819
 so this is the deep neural network built on top of that,

487
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:17,380
 yeah, and then we see the power of it, right,

488
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,180
 so this is artificial,

489
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,420
 artificial neural, artificial brain, right,

490
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,780
 our human brain may not be like that,

491
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,980
 actually, we know from very beginning, 1943,

492
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,660
 when the two gentlemen built this simple model,

493
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,020
 neural network model,

494
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,260
 it was, they was really, really,

495
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,620
 very, very oversimplified model, okay,

496
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,620
 so each neuron only have a very simple processing ability,

497
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,020
 and then can only receive the input,

498
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,940
 and then have a go to certain function,

499
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,460
 and then pass on to the next, okay,

500
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,940
 and then have some weight,

501
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,140
 that is everything we have inside the whole neural network,

502
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,420
 right, at moments,

503
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,020
 I mean, for each single cell is like that,

504
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,940
 but many neuroscientists,

505
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,260
 they believe actually our neuron inside the brain

506
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,420
 will be much more complicated,

507
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,660
 we are using an oversimplified thing,

508
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,260
 but you see what we can achieve now, okay,

509
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,780
 so human brain, the artificial neural network,

510
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,820
 probably still a big gap there,

511
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,820
 that's why I should have a group of people

512
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,660
 study the brain, cybernetics,

513
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,020
 they actually really say they should get more funding,

514
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,380
 they are criticized too much funding

515
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,420
 give to the deep neural network approach, okay,

516
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,900
 it's true, there are a lot of money was put in that side,

517
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,300
 but for fundamental study,

518
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,620
 they are talking about the model probably is wrong,

519
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,980
 the model is over too simple,

520
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,860
 and so they are talking about we should get more funding

521
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,380
 in the fundamental study of the neurons,

522
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,380
 each one and build up,

523
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,700
 anyway, okay, so this is still ongoing things,

524
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,540
 very, very quick briefing,

525
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,940
 yeah, we just talk about this,

526
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,260
 is talking about these two gentlemen,

527
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,140
 McCluck and Pitz,

528
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,819
 they are, one is a neuro,

529
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:15,580
 who is the neuroscientist,

530
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,580
 and one is, yeah, he's a logician, I think,

531
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,660
 so they work together,

532
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,660
 they come out with a very simple cells,

533
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,259
 and then propose a model, okay,

534
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:26,819
 and then come out with this gentleman,

535
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:27,819
 he's an engineer,

536
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:32,220
 so he actually build up the hardware systems to do it,

537
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,460
 and then have this perceptual,

538
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,700
 and then finally they have the,

539
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,980
 these two gentlemen actually criticize such simple systems,

540
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,660
 they know you cannot do even things like exclusive wall,

541
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,540
 okay, so that means your single layer perceptron

542
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,140
 is not powerful enough,

543
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,100
 you cannot do all the functional transmissions,

544
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,140
 yeah, so that's why later,

545
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,779
 so this is a time, actually, AI have a winter time,

546
00:42:58,779 --> 00:42:59,939
 okay, very cool,

547
00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:02,740
 because this time was very, very hot,

548
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,620
 and then, but by these two gentleman's paper,

549
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,380
 they talk about, hey, you can't even do exclusive,

550
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,180
 this kind of simple logic, okay,

551
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,500
 so that's why from here,

552
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,100
 these more than 10 years,

553
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,740
 the AI was very quiet,

554
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,299
 so still go back to probably symbolic AI time,

555
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:25,060
 okay, numerical AI was kind of cool down,

556
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,900
 and then come back when they actually finally invented

557
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,420
 the multi-layer perceptron, okay,

558
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,460
 with back propagation, the BP,

559
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,020
 so yeah, you see, Professor Hinton is here,

560
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,340
 he's one of it, yeah, I was reading this,

561
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:46,340
 when I doing PhD at that time was late 80s and early 90s,

562
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,820
 yeah, so their book, like a two Bible to me,

563
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,300
 one is blue color, one is brown color,

564
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,580
 yeah, volume one, volume two, okay,

565
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,060
 so each one have the, including BP algorithm one chapter,

566
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,380
 it's very hard to read, I remember, okay,

567
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,620
 anyway, so that is their book,

568
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,540
 was like our Bible to study, yeah,

569
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,660
 and then SVM, and then finally deep neural network, right,

570
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,300
 so again, Professor Hinton was one of it,

571
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,380
 so that's why he was considered

572
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,740
 one of the father of AI as well, yeah,

573
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,780
 so this is come to the deep neural network,

574
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,740
 and this slide actually is not complete at all, at all,

575
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,220
 okay, so it's purely, I highlight something

576
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,419
 which is more related to the NLP progress,

577
00:44:33,419 --> 00:44:35,859
 especially, although we have to do it, yeah,

578
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:39,379
 from your deep learning, then voice related,

579
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:42,020
 then this is the image processing

580
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,939
 because we have this convolutional neural network,

581
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:47,060
 and then you have the words,

582
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,060
 so word actually can work to back,

583
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,620
 so it's the TF-ITF representation,

584
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,279
 they have word representation, then,

585
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,540
 also very important thing is the alpha goal,

586
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,500
 so that is a big breakthrough,

587
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,740
 like you can really beat the champions in the world,

588
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,220
 I mean human, okay, so it's not able to,

589
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,340
 it's beyond using symbolic,

590
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,460
 okay, symbolic approach is not possible,

591
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,020
 so this is how actually I like to highlight this,

592
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,860
 alpha goal zero, so that means

593
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,940
 you don't need to have samples, okay,

594
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,860
 they just play with each other,

595
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,340
 and then they get a better, more authentic data set, right,

596
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,140
 so that is again based,

597
00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:31,660
 and then transformer come into play,

598
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,660
 so you have decoder, decoder, decoder,

599
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,220
 so actually you can do the translation,

600
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,460
 you can follow the sequence,

601
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,020
 so it's very, very important for NLP,

602
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,620
 and then GPT, so again, transformer,

603
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,020
 and then this is pre-trained,

604
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:54,020
 it's large, start to have large language model,

605
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,740
 so then you come to have this,

606
00:45:57,779 --> 00:46:00,299
 GPT-2, pre-trained large language model,

607
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:04,899
 so this one probably only have 1.6 billion parameters,

608
00:46:04,899 --> 00:46:09,979
 this one talking about 175 billion parameters,

609
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:13,379
 the huge increase about the computation power,

610
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:14,979
 knowledge you can train,

611
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:18,259
 and the whole architecture will be much more complicated,

612
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:21,459
 then you can have those which is more suitable

613
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:25,020
 for NLP process, okay, so it's not just translation,

614
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,940
 but much more NLP tasks, okay,

615
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,300
 including like not just a Q and A,

616
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,980
 not just a summarization,

617
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,940
 more including, more aware of the context information,

618
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:38,740
 so you can actually attract the entity relationship,

619
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,940
 and so on, okay, so that is a BERT,

620
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,860
 so BERT is more encoder, transformer base as well,

621
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,020
 okay, then you have GPT-3,

622
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,860
 so it's again even bigger model,

623
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,060
 and then we have chatgpd finally come this API,

624
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,980
 everybody start to use it,

625
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,259
 and within very, very short period of time,

626
00:46:57,259 --> 00:47:00,180
 the users increase dramatically, right,

627
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,980
 so we are one of it, yeah,

628
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,980
 and then also they can do text to image, right,

629
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,180
 or text to drawings, so that is a del E,

630
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,779
 and then mid-journey, yeah, those are important models,

631
00:47:16,779 --> 00:47:19,860
 and then we have four, I have, you know,

632
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,460
 not just from OpenAI, now the Microsoft,

633
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,580
 of course they also have this large language model,

634
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,900
 so they have a BART,

635
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,180
 and now which one you like most,

636
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,820
 you use BART, or you use chatgpd,

637
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:34,740
 or you use,

638
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,180
 which one are you using?

639
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,820
 Chatgpd still the most, okay, chatgpd 4,

640
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,780
 or even 4.0, okay, okay,

641
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,100
 but if you want to mix the image together,

642
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,620
 maybe you can try others as well, yeah,

643
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,020
 so yeah, I want to highlight something like, okay,

644
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,260
 other than the technology here,

645
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,940
 we also people start to realize the importance

646
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,260
 of having the control, right,

647
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,380
 the AI should have a governing,

648
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,100
 should have a good policy,

649
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:15,660
 so we don't let the bad guy using the powerful system, okay,

650
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,420
 so it's a bit like a nuclear, you know,

651
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,180
 put in some bad guy's hands,

652
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,260
 then can be very dangerous,

653
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,940
 imagine they use this for war, right,

654
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,060
 they use this design a soldier,

655
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,420
 and then to fight, yeah, or something,

656
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,620
 it can be dangerous, okay,

657
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:35,420
 so that's why they have AI warning,

658
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,980
 actually Professor Hinton, because of this,

659
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,980
 he quit the, he was, is he working for Google, I forgot,

660
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,940
 and then he quit from the company,

661
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,900
 actually he become independent person,

662
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,420
 so he actually want to give more warning

663
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,660
 to talk about the importance of governing, okay,

664
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:57,660
 I remember he was, I am 20, 21, 20, which one, which year,

665
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,900
 he was joking, he say, how come people worry about the AI,

666
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,580
 he think it's far away from dangerous weapon, you know,

667
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,380
 but he changed the mind,

668
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,980
 he realized, you know,

669
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,020
 with the development of the large language model,

670
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,980
 actually, it can be dangerous if not control it well, okay,

671
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,780
 it will be used, if it will be used by some people,

672
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:27,620
 which is with certain, we see the, you know, fake news,

673
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,540
 the fake image, right, so how, who is going to use it,

674
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,420
 if it's not governing properly,

675
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,660
 then can be very bad for human being as well, okay,

676
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,180
 it can be dangerous, yeah,

677
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:46,180
 so now they here, this is 2024, yeah, so we are here,

678
00:49:46,419 --> 00:49:51,259
 they can see, you can see the, yeah, the Dell,

679
00:49:51,259 --> 00:49:55,540
 actually, Sora, so Sora, yeah, they can even make a video,

680
00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:00,100
 right, so text to video, so yeah, this is definitely,

681
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,580
 can be a big impact, can create impact to those,

682
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:10,580
 like movie industry, you know, cartoon, you know,

683
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,299
 how this, but hopefully, we take it positively,

684
00:50:14,299 --> 00:50:17,540
 so it's not just create negative impact to them,

685
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,900
 but actually, because you can use the tools,

686
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,940
 so it will actually enhance our understanding

687
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,620
 or our thinking, then we can actually make use of this

688
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,580
 to make even better movie, or even better,

689
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,819
 more creativity involved by using them, right,

690
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:39,900
 to improve our work, okay,

691
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,540
 so this is a quick look of this,

692
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,700
 and this is based on this journalist,

693
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,900
 they wrote something, yeah, mainly bias towards, you know,

694
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:53,020
 NLP or popular AI models, so I draw this picture

695
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:58,020
 just to visualize it, okay, this is, I use history

696
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,820
 related to a symbolic AI, okay, from the,

697
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,660
 I think it's from Chad GBT, yeah, so this is, you know,

698
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:13,819
 we find basically, it's just, we have representation,

699
00:51:15,899 --> 00:51:19,779
 yeah, using the symbol and rules and logic,

700
00:51:19,779 --> 00:51:23,100
 and then those are the key characteristics,

701
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,140
 and they involve rule-based system,

702
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,819
 and then emphasis on the human readable,

703
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:31,859
 and we can interpret the answer, okay,

704
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:35,100
 that is a very good thing for symbolic approach,

705
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,540
 because you can understand the reasoning,

706
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,580
 the reasoning is based on logic way, okay,

707
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,140
 but not the data-driven, okay, data-driven,

708
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,820
 think about deep neural network, you get the answer,

709
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,020
 but you don't know how to interpret it well, right,

710
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,380
 so that is a very important research area

711
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,140
 to see how to interpret it, okay, for the, that,

712
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:00,820
 this is talking about example, talking about advantages,

713
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,020
 so this is talking about, you know,

714
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,020
 what is symbolic AI good for, like for diagnosis,

715
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,700
 and decision-making, also, at that time,

716
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,780
 NLP, we have to rely on the grammar rules, okay,

717
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,300
 and then try to use that to derive, to answer,

718
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,700
 compile, and then to understand the thing, okay,

719
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,820
 so this is early stage, the symbolic AI, okay,

720
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,060
 so the advantage is, actually, representation is,

721
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,780
 need to make use of the main knowledge to represent it,

722
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:36,540
 so it's very much rely on the programmer or designer, okay,

723
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,900
 the challenging is, actually, very difficult

724
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,900
 to handle uncertainty, and if it's information is incomplete,

725
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:49,300
 and handle large data set, okay, then,

726
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,540
 especially for non-symbolic task, such as vision, okay,

727
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,700
 so vision image processing, that is not really easy

728
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,620
 to represent in a symbol, by symbols, right,

729
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:07,140
 okay, I think this is talking about the early stage,

730
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:12,460
 how the neural network start, so this is the simple model,

731
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:16,540
 okay, proposed by the gentleman here,

732
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,980
 so, Neurons Scientists and the Logicians,

733
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,460
 so you can see, yeah, they are really oversimplifies

734
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,859
 the whole thing, to see, okay, each of these is a cell,

735
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:30,060
 and then you have input coming, so input is the output

736
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,820
 of the other neuron, multiply with the weight,

737
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,860
 and then become the input signal,

738
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,420
 and then how to combine those signal together,

739
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,700
 then passing on to the cell itself,

740
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,779
 and then get through the function,

741
00:53:43,779 --> 00:53:45,940
 and then get the output of it, okay,

742
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,500
 so it's a very, very simple model,

743
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,980
 Turing test was the one to set to see how the program

744
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,060
 answer the questions, whether you can tell this program

745
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,259
 is human or not human based on his reply,

746
00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:03,700
 okay, so that is to decide whether it can pass or not,

747
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:08,700
 and then you see, in a 2014, that was about six years

748
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:14,140
 after Dr. Tulin, Alan Tulin passed away, six years,

749
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,700
 yeah, so actually they did this test,

750
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,020
 the program, although it's called Eugene,

751
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,420
 actually it's written by, it's a chatbot,

752
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,180
 it's written by three researchers, okay,

753
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,540
 and then they believe they already passed the test,

754
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,660
 because 30% of judge believe this is a 13 years old boy,

755
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,419
 okay, cannot tell, it's a boy or it's a program,

756
00:54:34,419 --> 00:54:37,859
 so they believe they passed the Turing test already,

757
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,940
 okay, and then that's why this gentleman,

758
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,940
 must have, Sreeman, actually he is a co-founder

759
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,859
 of the DeepMind, the DeepMind bought over by Google,

760
00:54:47,859 --> 00:54:49,740
 okay, so it's a Google, and then he now works

761
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:53,259
 for the Microsoft, Microsoft AI CEO,

762
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,620
 so that's what he said, he last year, he said,

763
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:01,620
 okay, should let the robot having the money,

764
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,620
 and then ask them to make money, okay,

765
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,780
 then it can become a millionaire,

766
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,860
 that can pass the Turing test, okay,

767
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:16,860
 so that's what he suggested, 2023, June about there,

768
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,100
 okay, but I don't know, he said it's going to publish

769
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,420
 a paper to talk about this,

770
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,140
 but we haven't seen the publication yet, okay,

771
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:29,860
 so very, very quickly look at the application,

772
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:34,860
 so you can see, firstly, about game,

773
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,860
 okay, so as I said, yeah, reasoning,

774
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,000
 so why we want to do game,

775
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,220
 why we think game is a type of AI,

776
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,220
 why?

777
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,260
 Why we don't say, actually write a program

778
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,820
 which can print out your schedule for today,

779
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,140
 for example, this is not an AI program,

780
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,300
 why writing a game is an AI program?

781
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,580
 What's the difference, what's the key difference?

782
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,980
 Writing a game, okay, play game,

783
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,220
 do you think play game need intelligence?

784
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,660
 Especially complicated game,

785
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,379
 although you know how to play,

786
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,620
 you know the rules, for example, you know chess,

787
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,140
 you know how to play goal,

788
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,940
 but not everybody can win, right,

789
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:32,859
 somebody can win, somebody lose, yeah, so why?

790
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,140
 Although we know how to represent it,

791
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,940
 although we know the strategy,

792
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,700
 we know the rules, but how to apply the rules

793
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,620
 is very important, right, so that means

794
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,980
 it's decision making every step,

795
00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:54,180
 and also you probably need to look ahead,

796
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:58,180
 a few step ahead in order to make a decision, right,

797
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:04,620
 so that's why this is intelligence involved,

798
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,900
 so that's why they try to design a program

799
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,940
 which can do something like this, okay,

800
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,700
 although the rules given,

801
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,380
 representation can be represented by symbols,

802
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,460
 but then how to make it always win, for example,

803
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,020
 or can they actually beat the human, human being,

804
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,060
 human players, right, so it's not easy,

805
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,180
 then also with the limited resources,

806
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:30,060
 computational resources, memory resources at that time,

807
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,740
 it's not easy, so that's why it's very challenging already,

808
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,620
 so that is how the AI start, okay,

809
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,420
 so they use this to design the AI game,

810
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:43,420
 to design algorithms for game, okay,

811
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,460
 and also like proof, reasoning, okay,

812
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:50,340
 so again, mathematics proof, not everybody can do, right,

813
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,940
 although you know the working principle,

814
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,060
 but you probably cannot prove it, prove something, okay,

815
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,540
 so that is a theory proving to start,

816
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,820
 and then later, you know, language understanding,

817
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,380
 yeah, so language understanding at that time,

818
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,100
 actually you can still follow the grammar rules

819
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,580
 and to check syntax checking, you know,

820
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,540
 and so on, but yes, so that come into that,

821
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:17,540
 and then go into more challenging one,

822
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,340
 like computer vision, computer vision is not so easy

823
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,700
 to be represented by symbols, right,

824
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,420
 so that is early part, which that's why neural network

825
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,140
 in the early part is more focused on image,

826
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,220
 you know, representation, how to classify it,

827
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,180
 how to classify it, and so on,

828
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,380
 they're making a working machine, right, robots,

829
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,980
 so robot can do many, many things,

830
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:45,620
 like some robot designed for running or carry heavy things

831
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,940
 to deliver to specific location, danger location,

832
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,420
 or actually some robot can do journalism,

833
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:56,660
 can do flipping, can do, you know, climbing, and so on,

834
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:59,460
 so different purpose, and then expert system,

835
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,780
 yeah, many, many, many, okay, then just a quick look,

836
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,220
 so that's why I convinced them game is very important,

837
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,140
 so that's why we start with game,

838
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:12,140
 so first time in 1997, when the IBM Deep Blue

839
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:17,140
 actually can win the world champion for the chess,

840
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,259
 chess champion, it was very exciting things, okay,

841
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:23,740
 because it's a big achievement,

842
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,220
 because chess is not so, is not toy problem,

843
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:29,900
 and then the branch factor is about 35,

844
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,779
 that means if you have one, one state,

845
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,500
 you can have 35 possible way to move to next one, okay,

846
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,180
 so every step is like this,

847
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,180
 so can be quite challenging

848
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,020
 for computer resources at that time, okay,

849
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:49,380
 so you see, but this is rule-based, yeah,

850
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:54,100
 so they actually win, so it's a very big news,

851
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:59,100
 then actually in 2016, we come with the AlphaGo, okay,

852
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,380
 so this is really a big, big one,

853
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:06,820
 because this is talking about goal,

854
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:10,340
 is not just about the chess, okay,

855
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,340
 so chess actually is much simple,

856
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:17,340
 so you can see the branch factor for goal is 250,

857
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,180
 okay, so that is really beyond symbolic AI can handle,

858
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,180
 so they have to rely on neural network,

859
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,820
 so that time is already neural network approach,

860
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,220
 and then deep neural network approach,

861
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:34,220
 and also combined with certain symbolic AI idea, okay,

862
01:00:37,939 --> 01:00:42,259
 and then two years later, they have this game,

863
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:44,459
 which is teamwork, okay,

864
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:48,020
 so OpenAI actually developed five members to play together,

865
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,939
 I don't know how many of you play this Dota 2, any of you?

866
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:58,020
 Yeah, so this one actually start to defeat the,

867
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,220
 in the beginning is defeat certain players

868
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,180
 with a high skill, okay, so they have some score

869
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,220
 above 4,000, and then they play with these people,

870
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,580
 and they win, and later they can play,

871
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,700
 they can win the professional team,

872
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,980
 okay, so that is really incredible,

873
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,460
 at that time, actually Bill Gates said,

874
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,259
 whoa, that is really a huge milestone, okay,

875
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:23,820
 so very, very hard, because this is five members

876
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:26,740
 work together, okay, so not a single player,

877
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:30,020
 I mean, not a single agent, it's five agent,

878
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,180
 so really, really big achievement, okay,

879
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:36,459
 so that is the one, so that is one,

880
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,580
 oh, one year later, actually, they can beat the,

881
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,660
 really beat the top professional,

882
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,939
 so this is just still beats the,

883
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,299
 MM of some score, about 4,000 or something,

884
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:50,580
 it's not the totally professional player,

885
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,419
 but it's the high skill players,

886
01:01:52,419 --> 01:01:53,339
 and then one year later,

887
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:56,220
 they can beat the professional players,

888
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:01,580
 and then we talk about, yeah, three years ago,

889
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:06,939
 actually, they developed this more general agent,

890
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:09,279
 so it's no longer just play one type of game,

891
01:02:09,279 --> 01:02:14,279
 they can play 500,000 different games,

892
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,259
 okay, so one single agent, they can be trained,

893
01:02:18,259 --> 01:02:20,359
 play so many different kind of games,

894
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:24,480
 so it's more, definitely one step towards

895
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,040
 a more general AI kind of, right,

896
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,280
 because they are not trained just to play

897
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:35,120
 one type of thing, but many, many, many, okay,

898
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,160
 so that's why teamwork always refer to this,

899
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,080
 and then, yeah, this is the time they trained it,

900
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,800
 and then Bill Gates made a comment,

901
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,160
 he was very, very impressed by this.

902
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,880
 Okay, so this one, we just try to say,

903
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,880
 when Deep Blue win the world champion,

904
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:00,400
 actually, is that really our program very intelligent,

905
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,040
 or actually, it's more about the computation power?

906
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,880
 Okay, so these slides try to tell us,

907
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,880
 actually, it's probably still computation power, okay,

908
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,360
 humans do have a better strategy,

909
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,840
 otherwise, there is no way to move

910
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,080
 within such short period of time,

911
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,400
 and can still, actually, he only lose one,

912
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,680
 I think, duo or three or something,

913
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,080
 so he still have a very good strategy to achieve that, okay,

914
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:34,240
 so that means our computer, although they win some game,

915
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,880
 but because probably more rely on the parallel processing,

916
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,440
 and memories, and they can look ahead,

917
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,880
 many steps ahead, with the support

918
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,320
 of the computation ability, okay, but not the strategy,

919
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,920
 not really the strategy.

920
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,480
 Yeah, and this is talking about the self-taught,

921
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,320
 because of the game developments,

922
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:02,320
 so this is, that's why DeepMind actually can use Google,

923
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,320
 AlphaGo zero, so you don't need to have,

924
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,560
 look into the data, but they actually play

925
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,000
 against each other to do that, okay,

926
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,280
 and then further, one year later,

927
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,600
 they, oh no, a few months later, they can even do better,

928
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:21,160
 the Alpha zero can actually beat the AlphaGo zero, okay,

929
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:26,160
 so that is things, and this is a slide talking about,

930
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,279
 they can do the Delta two, okay,

931
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:33,400
 so that is the one about the teamwork.

932
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,600
 About theory proving, I like to highlight this one, okay,

933
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,200
 so DeepMind, again, DeepMind come out with this

934
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,160
 called Alpha proof, and the Alpha geometry,

935
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,960
 so actually, geometry two, so actually they can,

936
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,480
 they actually got the silver medal

937
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:56,279
 for the international mass Olympia, okay,

938
01:04:56,279 --> 01:05:00,839
 only one marker away to get gold medal, okay,

939
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:04,799
 very impressive, right, so their program actually can,

940
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:09,120
 you know, like play with, you know,

941
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,640
 attending this competition, they can use the program

942
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,640
 to get the chief very high score, okay,

943
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:23,520
 and then, yeah, so some exciting progress made,

944
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,080
 actually I use this bot to ask, you know,

945
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,839
 what is the progress made in theory proving,

946
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:37,359
 and this is the answer they give me,

947
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,799
 so that's how we can learn now, yeah,

948
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,640
 I think that's true, the things they got for us, okay,

949
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,200
 and then natural language understanding,

950
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,440
 we know it start from like theory,

951
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,760
 like have a personal assistant, until, you know,

952
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,040
 Google Llama, and then they have this,

953
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,600
 wow, very impressive conversation,

954
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,120
 and now it's nothing, okay, when the chat GPT come,

955
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,240
 and then you can see, you know, you ask about,

956
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,080
 show me image of Paris, they will show you the image,

957
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,480
 and together with description, this is very, very good,

958
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,440
 so combined with text, with image as well,

959
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,120
 you know, highlight the things,

960
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,680
 and for face recognition, voice recognition,

961
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,600
 also huge progress made, right, so, yeah,

962
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:28,120
 still very, very useful for industry,

963
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:32,120
 and the progress there, very impressive, yeah,

964
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,640
 can you tell which one is a fake, which one is a real,

965
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,720
 it's very hard, right,

966
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:42,120
 okay, yeah, this is fake news, fake image, you know,

967
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,160
 it's a very big thing, and then self-driving,

968
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,879
 yeah, I think this is a very important area,

969
01:06:50,879 --> 01:06:55,879
 and I didn't even update, nowadays really become like,

970
01:06:56,839 --> 01:06:59,359
 many places already make use of it,

971
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:04,000
 our NTU also have, is that fully in use already,

972
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,960
 from our shuttle, I mean, our shuttle from the pioneer

973
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,200
 to campus, is that already self-drive,

974
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,040
 I know they are testing, but I'm not sure

975
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:18,440
 whether they are totally, totally self-driving now,

976
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:24,400
 I didn't check, huh, not yet, no, yeah, I know it's still,

977
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,160
 I can still see the driver,

978
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,960
 but they are still testing the road,

979
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,960
 I think they aim for that, to release it,

980
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,040
 okay, very cool robots, so this one I like most,

981
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:40,040
 okay, see, this one, they can cook 5,000 dishes,

982
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,160
 wow, so nice, okay, yeah, but it's totally functioning,

983
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,400
 okay, the only thing is too expensive,

984
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,080
 so too expensive to be in the market, okay,

985
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:56,200
 so too big probably, or too expensive is a main thing,

986
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,720
 otherwise, so if any of you, yeah, interested in this,

987
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,040
 yeah, try to make it handy and less expensive,

988
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,600
 it'll be a huge market there, okay,

989
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:10,600
 so it's no longer, you know, those dancing,

990
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,160
 oh, it's so impressive, right, they can actually jump

991
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,319
 and they're on even surfaces, so every step, actually,

992
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:19,719
 they need to make decision, they need to know

993
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:23,719
 how to keep them balanced, so it's very, very useful,

994
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:28,599
 and also more engineered arts, you know,

995
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,160
 so this is really like a real person with a voice,

996
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:37,160
 and with more looks like a human robot, okay,

997
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,720
 then they can actually talk to human, yeah,

998
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,520
 so this also, the latest update you can find here,

999
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,960
 so this is the more human-like, okay, so it's not,

1000
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,640
 that's why we say it's different aspect,

1001
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,960
 how you expect this robot to be, so human-like,

1002
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,320
 you probably want them to do the healthcare,

1003
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,040
 and all it has to do with human conversation,

1004
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,479
 the human touch, probably more,

1005
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,399
 can have emotion expression, you know,

1006
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:09,799
 can respond to you like a human,

1007
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:11,080
 and then another type of robot,

1008
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,519
 which is more like a carry out certain tasks,

1009
01:09:14,519 --> 01:09:17,960
 like go deep down to the mountain to do some,

1010
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,080
 fetch something, you know, human heart to be deployed there,

1011
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,599
 so it's a very different type of thing, yeah,

1012
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:29,600
 so this is example for that, to update it,

1013
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:35,680
 yeah, expert system, so looks like this was one in China,

1014
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,360
 they had this, you know, help to do the diagnosis,

1015
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,760
 yeah, four years ago, and also they pass the exam, okay,

1016
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,360
 they pass, they can understand all the 40,

1017
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:52,360
 53 medical textbook, and they can pass the exam quite well,

1018
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:58,120
 okay, so GP will be replaced by them, okay,

1019
01:09:59,839 --> 01:10:03,120
 also, yeah, this is about large language model, right,

1020
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,160
 so we talk about this popular one,

1021
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,639
 and then the one from Google,

1022
01:10:07,639 --> 01:10:09,920
 and then from the Google as well,

1023
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,759
 human-like, actually, yeah, it's more advanced,

1024
01:10:12,759 --> 01:10:17,759
 so you can actually have the different model,

1025
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,320
 so this is the number of parameters,

1026
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,600
 you can see how the size increased, okay,

1027
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,560
 so hardware is very, very important, right, for the AI,

1028
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,040
 so you have to fine tune these parameters,

1029
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,640
 so your hardware, that's why the price

1030
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,760
 for those hardware AI company go up so dramatically,

1031
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,760
 yeah, so this is a highlight about the generative model

1032
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,440
 in large language model, in NLP,

1033
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,960
 or natural language understanding,

1034
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,720
 then this is about computer vision,

1035
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:59,000
 image generation, or deep dream,

1036
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,040
 and then they can have image describe,

1037
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,040
 you know, you use words to describe,

1038
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,560
 and then they generate the image for us,

1039
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,480
 and you can also select the style,

1040
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,360
 and select something which is,

1041
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,040
 looks like a really like a photo,

1042
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,719
 some very beautiful, okay,

1043
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,320
 then possible new application,

1044
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,240
 this is also I asked Chet GBT, okay, highlight me this,

1045
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:27,160
 and they can really give me some meaningful suggestions,

1046
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,160
 like for example, personalization,

1047
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,320
 so you can actually offer this personalizer,

1048
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,880
 recommendation and responses,

1049
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,000
 based on user preference and so on, yeah, true,

1050
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,240
 you know, those are the things,

1051
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:45,240
 and then industry, how the industry will be affected,

1052
01:11:45,519 --> 01:11:47,480
 so this is related industry,

1053
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:50,360
 with a very good large language model,

1054
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,360
 and those will be future applications,

1055
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,920
 top 10 application, yeah, here are the top 10,

1056
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,679
 so even finance, trading,

1057
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:04,679
 also cybersecurity, drug discovery,

1058
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:06,519
 or just talk about drug discovery,

1059
01:12:06,519 --> 01:12:09,160
 this is the one, right, alpha fold,

1060
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,280
 yeah, so this is so impressive,

1061
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,840
 and I like highlight this one, alpha fold three,

1062
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,720
 okay, so this is talking about,

1063
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,480
 they can predict structure and interactions

1064
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,680
 of all of the live molecules,

1065
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,080
 okay, so beyond no longer just protein,

1066
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,200
 but all the molecules, okay,

1067
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,000
 so that is really very, very impressive,

1068
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,639
 because this is a hugely,

1069
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:36,720
 can create huge impact to the drug industry,

1070
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,680
 and also the medicine, medicine,

1071
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,800
 and also the medical, you know, analysis, everything,

1072
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,720
 this is very impressive, okay, arts,

1073
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,480
 okay, so this arts related,

1074
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:54,760
 now E3 now, okay, so they can actually generate the images,

1075
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,480
 so impressive, not just a style,

1076
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:04,480
 but also, you know, yeah, take a look at those website,

1077
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,959
 find out the details, yeah, get the video,

1078
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:12,959
 so this is Sora, so you can see the video can be generated,

1079
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,679
 okay, and then one slide is about governing

1080
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:22,280
 and the human right, civil rights, okay, for robots,

1081
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:26,120
 so talking about Sophia is going to be a citizen,

1082
01:13:27,799 --> 01:13:30,280
 it's already a citizen, sorry,

1083
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,519
 she's already a citizen in 2017, okay,

1084
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,960
 then this Dr. David Hanson talk about,

1085
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:44,000
 predict, you know, technology grow become uncontrollable,

1086
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,200
 so need to be very careful with this,

1087
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:50,720
 and we are talking about the race between the wisdom,

1088
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,000
 human, and also the technology power, okay,

1089
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,520
 so need to keep a good balance,

1090
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,480
 otherwise, it can be dangerous, okay.

1091
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:04,959
 What's next, so key challenges, I try to highlight,

1092
01:14:04,959 --> 01:14:08,400
 so this can be useful for future research area,

1093
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,240
 to look into it, yeah, how to handle ambiguity,

1094
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:16,240
 for example, and how to learn the common sense knowledge,

1095
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,120
 because some common sense, we just know about

1096
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,799
 how to pass on to computer, yeah,

1097
01:14:21,799 --> 01:14:23,799
 and also how to handle the fake one,

1098
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:27,799
 and then computer and machine vision,

1099
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,680
 those fake faces, fake news, auto drive,

1100
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,280
 reinforced learning, that is still something,

1101
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,240
 it's good progress in those areas,

1102
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:42,200
 but still have things to be done, okay.

1103
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,880
 What's next, so based on these boom bursts,

1104
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:50,880
 last month, they list out, you know, stage of AI,

1105
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,800
 so chatbot is considered as level one,

1106
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,240
 then reasoners, so you can have reasoning,

1107
01:14:57,519 --> 01:14:59,719
 agents, so you can actually take actions,

1108
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:03,920
 moving around, and then you can actually inventing things,

1109
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,840
 next level, and then you become, you know,

1110
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:11,320
 can organize everything, so that would be more towards

1111
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:16,320
 a super intelligence or super AI or general AI, okay.

1112
01:15:18,599 --> 01:15:22,980
 So take a look, Singapore, okay, we are here,

1113
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:28,500
 in term of global AI index, they measure talents,

1114
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,860
 infrastructure, you know, government involved, and so on,

1115
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:36,059
 so you see other than US and China, Singapore is here,

1116
01:15:36,059 --> 01:15:38,660
 yeah, especially you see operating environment,

1117
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:43,660
 very high, and government strategy is very good,

1118
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,940
 so you can see we are here,

1119
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:49,980
 we are before all those big players as well,

1120
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:54,900
 and also look at Singapore position for the investments

1121
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:59,900
 from private investments worldwide, so yeah,

1122
01:16:00,259 --> 01:16:05,099
 we are more than Japan, like Australia, and so on,

1123
01:16:05,099 --> 01:16:10,099
 so it's good opportunity here, okay, so that's all,

1124
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:16,940
 okay, that's all for my lecture one, lecture one, okay.

1125
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:22,620
 So we still have, yeah, we still have two more lectures,

1126
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:32,660
 to start talk about state-based representation and search,

1127
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:40,780
 maybe five minutes break, or no break, do you need a break?

1128
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:46,540
 This is very much introduction, no break, huh?

1129
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:52,019
 Oh, break, five minutes break.

1130
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:52,860
 Okay.

1131
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:13,860
 Hi, yes.

1132
01:17:14,019 --> 01:17:18,420
 The quiz on week five is more depending on the program

1133
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:19,740
 or the exercise.

1134
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:24,740
 Multiple question, concept, not program, no programming.

1135
01:17:36,299 --> 01:17:39,179
 We cannot find the past materials.

1136
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:41,059
 Oh, are you sure?

1137
01:17:42,139 --> 01:17:42,980
 Hey, how come?

1138
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,820
 Oh, only topic one?

1139
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:46,660
 Yeah, yeah.

1140
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,660
 Then who make it not available?

1141
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:50,500
 I already make it available.

1142
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,460
 Oh, yeah, it's strange, okay, okay.

1143
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:58,059
 Somebody changed it.

1144
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:04,500
 Yes.

1145
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,099
 Two, two, three.

1146
01:18:22,099 --> 01:18:26,380
 Well, this lesson being open next semester.

1147
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:29,940
 Next semester, not sure, it's not confirmed yet.

1148
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:34,460
 I think depends because every of us actually have a lot

1149
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:38,019
 teaching next semester, but likely they probably want

1150
01:18:38,019 --> 01:18:41,940
 to push for it because it is a very long waiting list,

1151
01:18:42,019 --> 01:18:43,980
 but up to the school to decide.

1152
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,379
 But actually you can take other courses,

1153
01:18:53,379 --> 01:18:57,099
 other similar one like pattern recognition,

1154
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:00,460
 also which one, pattern recognition will be next semester,

1155
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:05,460
 I think, and also the NLP next semester.

1156
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,580
 I have a question.

1157
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:19,580
 Do I team up with a classmate from tomorrow class?

1158
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:25,019
 Can, can, as long as he's post-grad.

1159
01:19:25,019 --> 01:19:26,259
 Okay.

1160
01:19:26,259 --> 01:19:29,259
 Cannot be undergrad because the requirement is different.

1161
01:19:29,259 --> 01:19:31,259
 Okay, okay, thank you.

1162
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:12,780
 Okay.

1163
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:42,780
 Okay.

1164
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:12,780
 Okay.

1165
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:42,780
 Okay.

1166
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:12,780
 Okay.

1167
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:42,780
 Okay.

1168
01:23:12,379 --> 01:23:13,219
 Hello.

1169
01:23:15,219 --> 01:23:18,940
 Hello, hello, hello.

1170
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,179
 Okay, shall we go back to study?

1171
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:32,860
 Yeah, I have no idea why the topic two was not available.

1172
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:35,179
 So I just make it available now.

1173
01:23:35,179 --> 01:23:37,500
 Can you see now, NTU Learn?

1174
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:43,500
 Topic two for lecture two to five, or two to six?

1175
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:50,100
 Or two to five, yes.

1176
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,260
 Can see now, huh?

1177
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,100
 Okay.

1178
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:56,300
 Yeah, I think they said something they said probably

1179
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,580
 because of the few add and drop.

1180
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:02,860
 So they just put one week's slides,

1181
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:07,260
 but actually one week is already including the topic two.

1182
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,340
 Okay.

1183
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:21,580
 Okay, so now let's start to discuss the symbolic AI.

1184
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,300
 So we are done with introduction.

1185
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:26,180
 Okay, very, very, very brief introduction

1186
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:28,980
 and highlight some key applications.

1187
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:31,660
 It's a mix of the symbolic AI-based approach

1188
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:34,900
 and also numerical AI-based approach.

1189
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:38,780
 Now we focus symbolic AI.

1190
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:43,780
 Okay, so you can see this is not really mimic our brain.

1191
01:24:45,299 --> 01:24:49,420
 Okay, so it's not mimic how our brain

1192
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:51,620
 solve the problem from neural level.

1193
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:56,620
 So that is like data-driven and also like bottom-up.

1194
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:58,980
 Okay, we see bottom-up because we are looking

1195
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:03,059
 into each cells to see how each cell process the data

1196
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,740
 and then come out with a representation.

1197
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:09,740
 So it's like from very basic one data directly driven

1198
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:11,780
 and come with abstraction.

1199
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,420
 Okay, representation, if you consider

1200
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:17,180
 the network representation as a representation,

1201
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,900
 then it's like from bottom to the top.

1202
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:22,500
 Okay, so that is a neural network-based approach.

1203
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,820
 Or we also call numerical AI.

1204
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:28,380
 Numerical AI because it's all numbers like, okay.

1205
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,940
 But symbolic AI, from the name you can tell, right?

1206
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:33,540
 It's a symbol-based.

1207
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:36,700
 So symbol-based, that means it's top-down.

1208
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:40,740
 Top-down meaning we need to understand the problem first.

1209
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:45,540
 Okay, as a designer, we need to know the problem very well.

1210
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,460
 And after that, we try to do abstraction.

1211
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,780
 Okay, we need to come out with the full understanding.

1212
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:56,299
 Then we decide, okay, how to represent these things,

1213
01:25:56,299 --> 01:26:01,099
 use symbols, and then computer can understand this symbol

1214
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:04,380
 and then can understand how to process it.

1215
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,740
 Okay, so that is a key idea.

1216
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:09,380
 So we need to come out with a representation,

1217
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:13,020
 use symbols, and then come out with a legal rule,

1218
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:18,020
 rules to governing the movement of the program.

1219
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:20,100
 Okay, then you write the code

1220
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,740
 to say how to manipulate the things.

1221
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:24,300
 So that is the idea.

1222
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,900
 Okay, so probably still too abstract, huh?

1223
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:30,820
 So basically, we need to explicitly define the symbol

1224
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:34,740
 and then define the legal rules can be used.

1225
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,099
 So it's like a symbol for representation,

1226
01:26:38,099 --> 01:26:41,340
 rules for manipulation, okay, or creation.

1227
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:46,540
 So use partial knowledge and derive further new knowledge

1228
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,019
 and from knowledge and then try to actually come out

1229
01:26:49,019 --> 01:26:52,059
 with performance of the task.

1230
01:26:52,059 --> 01:26:53,660
 So that is the idea.

1231
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:58,460
 Okay, use chess as an example, play chess, okay, chess game.

1232
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:02,060
 So what we do is we have the chess board, right,

1233
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,620
 and then we have pieces.

1234
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:06,900
 We have those each pieces like some king, queen,

1235
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,900
 you know, different things.

1236
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:13,340
 So we use the chess, the board to represent it.

1237
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:16,060
 Each board can be one state

1238
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:18,340
 and then each piece on the board,

1239
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:22,100
 the location is you use symbol to represent.

1240
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:26,100
 Okay, so if this symbol is king, we probably use K.

1241
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,300
 If it's queen, use Q, you know,

1242
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:30,060
 whatever you like.

1243
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,500
 So use a symbol to represent the things

1244
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,660
 and then you use a data structure

1245
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:36,260
 to represent the whole thing.

1246
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:39,660
 Okay, so this is representation, you see?

1247
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:42,140
 Very different from neural network approach, right?

1248
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:45,180
 Neural network approach, you don't have representation.

1249
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:47,060
 You don't have abstraction.

1250
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:50,420
 You directly data, driven, you know, learn, learn, learn

1251
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,580
 and then come out with a vector representation.

1252
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,380
 That is a representation.

1253
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:56,140
 It's a numerical value, right?

1254
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:57,660
 You cannot figure out what this,

1255
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:00,460
 but yes, this is a representation.

1256
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:02,540
 This one have meaning, okay?

1257
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:06,220
 So this symbol, each symbol means something to us

1258
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:08,139
 so can be explained it.

1259
01:28:08,139 --> 01:28:10,059
 Okay, so symbol that is the one.

1260
01:28:10,059 --> 01:28:13,059
 Rule, yeah, talk about movements.

1261
01:28:13,059 --> 01:28:17,660
 So for example, king can move from vertically,

1262
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:21,180
 horizontally, diagonal, you can move as well.

1263
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:24,260
 You know, as long as nobody block you, you can move, right?

1264
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,940
 So that is a rule you can write.

1265
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:30,940
 So for each piece, you can define the legal rules,

1266
01:28:31,059 --> 01:28:33,379
 allowed movement, okay?

1267
01:28:33,379 --> 01:28:37,099
 So define this one by one, very much like an expert system.

1268
01:28:37,099 --> 01:28:40,980
 You know, experts need to have the representation.

1269
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:45,980
 Then state out clearly the legal rules one by one,

1270
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:49,339
 but you need to list out all the possible combinations.

1271
01:28:49,339 --> 01:28:51,419
 That's a serious part, okay?

1272
01:28:51,419 --> 01:28:53,660
 You need to do this out everything.

1273
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:57,099
 Then operation or manipulation.

1274
01:28:57,099 --> 01:28:59,900
 Use symbol and the rules to make movement.

1275
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:03,340
 So your code should be able to say, okay,

1276
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:07,300
 if this piece is a K, that means it's a king,

1277
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:10,820
 then you can look left, right, you know,

1278
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:15,540
 forward, vertical in front, or in the same role,

1279
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:18,300
 or diagonal, both direction.

1280
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,260
 If that's no piece block there,

1281
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:23,220
 you can move in that location.

1282
01:29:24,019 --> 01:29:27,540
 So something like this, you need to write everything.

1283
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:31,540
 Then depends on what position you are in now,

1284
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:34,380
 then you can decide where to move next.

1285
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:38,059
 That is symbolic AI, okay?

1286
01:29:38,059 --> 01:29:39,860
 For game play, for game play.

1287
01:29:41,099 --> 01:29:44,900
 Okay, so that's what we are going to talk.

1288
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:46,620
 What is symbolic AI?

1289
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:50,059
 Why we have this so-called representation?

1290
01:29:50,059 --> 01:29:52,300
 Why we have a state space?

1291
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,540
 We have a state space approach.

1292
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:58,540
 And why likely we have to use a graph representation?

1293
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:01,100
 And then why we have search?

1294
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,340
 Okay, then search have two kind of search.

1295
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:06,980
 Exhausted search, that means if all the state

1296
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:10,780
 can be represented in memory, or in our computer,

1297
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:14,300
 then we should have a way, don't miss out any state.

1298
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:19,300
 Okay, as long as I systematically search through the space,

1299
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:21,940
 I'm able to find the answer.

1300
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:24,660
 So that is exhausted search.

1301
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:27,179
 Another one, much more efficient way,

1302
01:30:27,179 --> 01:30:29,259
 we should make use of the hints, right?

1303
01:30:29,259 --> 01:30:32,780
 Don't blindly search everything.

1304
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:36,059
 You should follow certain pattern to make use of hints

1305
01:30:36,059 --> 01:30:37,900
 to search for answer.

1306
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,980
 Okay, so this is the type of search.

1307
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:42,339
 That's what we are going to discuss.

1308
01:30:42,339 --> 01:30:45,419
 Okay, so you can see here, yeah, so symbolic AI,

1309
01:30:45,419 --> 01:30:48,379
 then you have the states, and then you have

1310
01:30:48,379 --> 01:30:51,500
 inference rules, the rules, and then you have the space.

1311
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:56,500
 Each state consists of the, I mean, define the whole space.

1312
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,820
 Okay, so for knowledge representation,

1313
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:02,900
 actually, yeah, those logic ones.

1314
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:07,500
 So you can use very much the logic representation.

1315
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,100
 You use the predicate calculus,

1316
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:13,540
 or you use the proportional, proposition calculus,

1317
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:15,860
 but that is likely not.

1318
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:17,900
 But those are first-order logic.

1319
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:20,019
 Okay, the neural network I put here,

1320
01:31:20,019 --> 01:31:24,540
 because in general, this is the possible representation.

1321
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:29,540
 Okay, then data structure, yeah, likely the graph and trees.

1322
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:32,780
 And then we talk about the specific problem

1323
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:36,620
 to see why it's good to have a graph representation,

1324
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:39,500
 okay, because that's a theory behind can support us.

1325
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:42,059
 And then why state space graph,

1326
01:31:42,059 --> 01:31:45,219
 and then something related to the graph terminologies.

1327
01:31:45,219 --> 01:31:47,179
 I think you all learned this before, right?

1328
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:50,340
 I think you all learned discrete math before, right?

1329
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:51,300
 In undergrad.

1330
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:56,220
 So yeah, this slide I keep, but I'm not going through,

1331
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,020
 so you should be able to take a look.

1332
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,100
 And then the state space approach,

1333
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,940
 like we show you the example, using TikTok poll,

1334
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:08,060
 use eight puzzle or 15 puzzle.

1335
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:10,940
 We also use a travel salesman problem.

1336
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:15,700
 And then search strategy, so data-driven or goal-driven.

1337
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,580
 Forward or backwards.

1338
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:20,700
 And then we were going to cover this

1339
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,300
 in our next week lecture.

1340
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,860
 Okay, so today we need to finish all the way here.

1341
01:32:26,179 --> 01:32:27,019
 Okay.

1342
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:34,900
 Yeah, okay, because one of our key textbook is Luger's book.

1343
01:32:35,099 --> 01:32:38,860
 So that is a very, very influential textbook

1344
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:42,460
 in symbolic AI, okay, so that is our textbook.

1345
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:45,740
 So this is how he define introduction, okay?

1346
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:50,220
 He said two most fundamental concern of AI researcher

1347
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:52,940
 is how to represent the things, okay?

1348
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:55,020
 Then secondly, how to search,

1349
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:57,740
 how to have a problem-solving techniques.

1350
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:00,940
 So the representation, that means actually

1351
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:05,220
 we can capture the knowledge, okay, in a language.

1352
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:08,540
 So this is how to, using the language

1353
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:11,180
 which computer can understand, okay?

1354
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:13,500
 We need to actually represent it.

1355
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,500
 Computer can understand, human can understand,

1356
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:17,580
 we need to do that.

1357
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:19,580
 So capture knowledge in a way,

1358
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:22,620
 and computer can understand, computer can manipulate,

1359
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:24,500
 computer can operate on.

1360
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,100
 Okay, so that is the one.

1361
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:30,500
 Then search is to systematically or with a hint

1362
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:33,980
 to explore the whole problem space, okay?

1363
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:37,580
 So this is the two most, I mean,

1364
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:40,220
 if you can get these two done, that's it, right?

1365
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:41,580
 Problem solved.

1366
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,300
 Yeah, so this is what we are talking about,

1367
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,340
 space representation.

1368
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:47,420
 Now, define all the possible states,

1369
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:50,460
 and then you see how to move from one state to another.

1370
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:53,620
 Okay, so this is use a model to differentiate,

1371
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:56,100
 configure it, and then find possible paths.

1372
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:59,140
 Okay, let's take a look at this example.

1373
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:02,060
 This is a eight-puzzle problem.

1374
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:05,100
 Okay, so eight-puzzle, that means we have eight

1375
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:07,420
 numbered tiles, okay?

1376
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:11,820
 So one from one to eight, plus one empty tile, okay?

1377
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:13,060
 So that is in blue.

1378
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:17,220
 So suppose this is our starting state, okay?

1379
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,100
 Our starting state from here.

1380
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,660
 And this is our goal.

1381
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:21,780
 We want to achieve this.

1382
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:25,020
 We want the tiles to be arranged in this way.

1383
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,820
 One, two, three, second row, four, five, six, seven, eight,

1384
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:30,860
 and then the blue tile is here.

1385
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:33,980
 Okay, sorry, and this is the,

1386
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:35,660
 in textbook they don't have the goal state,

1387
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:37,060
 but I feel it's good to have it,

1388
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:39,140
 I forgot coloring it.

1389
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:43,300
 Okay, so this is suppose it's a blue color, okay?

1390
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:45,140
 The empty tower.

1391
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:47,500
 Okay, so suppose this is our goal state.

1392
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:53,300
 Okay, then for symbolic EI, how are we going to write it?

1393
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:55,660
 Okay, so you need to use symbol to represent, right?

1394
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:59,100
 So symbol to represent one and the position,

1395
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,540
 and then we define the rules.

1396
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:03,580
 So what is the legal rule moment?

1397
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:07,100
 Okay, we only move the blue tower.

1398
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:12,100
 Okay, so blue tower, yeah, you can move up or down

1399
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:15,860
 or left or right, okay, if possible.

1400
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:18,019
 Not out of the board, okay?

1401
01:35:18,019 --> 01:35:19,620
 So this is the rule.

1402
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:23,660
 So for this case, yeah, if you move to the left,

1403
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:28,180
 then move to the left, exchange with the number seven, right?

1404
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:31,820
 Yeah, if you move to the up, then exchange with number four.

1405
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:35,700
 That's how, only these four options, right?

1406
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:38,099
 Yeah, then after each of these, then you can decide.

1407
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:42,700
 Okay, so for this one, up, move up will be out, so cannot.

1408
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:45,019
 Can move down, move down to where?

1409
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,059
 Previous one, right?

1410
01:35:51,059 --> 01:35:52,740
 Yes, it form a loop.

1411
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:56,700
 So if you don't allow the loop, then you don't take it.

1412
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:01,139
 Okay, although actually it's a legal movement, right?

1413
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:04,300
 But then, suppose we don't want to loop back.

1414
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:09,300
 So then we have this, can only go left and right.

1415
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:14,020
 So this is how you, so you can have every step.

1416
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:17,980
 So that is, each of these is a legal state.

1417
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:21,620
 And then the whole thing, we haven't finished yet.

1418
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:25,780
 The whole thing will form the state space, okay?

1419
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:27,340
 State space.

1420
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:31,940
 And then, definitely one of it will be something like this.

1421
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,700
 The goal state, okay?

1422
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:38,780
 So basically the problem solving become, we start from here.

1423
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:40,700
 And then we need to search, search, search,

1424
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:42,540
 search to find this.

1425
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:47,900
 Okay, so how to search to find the answer?

1426
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,780
 Can do systematic search.

1427
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:53,940
 That means every state search, right?

1428
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:56,540
 Then find the match, okay, got it.

1429
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:58,860
 But it's very efficient, right?

1430
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:03,220
 But can, if the state, if the states can, I mean,

1431
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:06,260
 state space is big enough and our computer can hold it.

1432
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:09,780
 And we have enough time, take ages to find it,

1433
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:13,060
 you don't mind, then yes, okay, can.

1434
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,380
 But normally that is not the case, right?

1435
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:17,540
 Yeah, so you need to have a strategy

1436
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:20,620
 to find the answer quickly, okay, more effectively.

1437
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:25,019
 So that is how to design a hint to find it, okay?

1438
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:26,900
 So this is what we have.

1439
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:29,620
 And so things related to the search,

1440
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:32,060
 that's why we say why is it exhaustive search, okay?

1441
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:35,340
 You search, search, search, but systematically, okay?

1442
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:36,860
 Don't miss out anything.

1443
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:40,300
 If the answer is there, you should be able to find it,

1444
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,540
 given enough time and space.

1445
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:46,140
 Okay, another thing is actually you do have a hint,

1446
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:48,580
 how to make use of the hint to find it.

1447
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:50,740
 Okay, so why the systematic search?

1448
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:54,540
 Another one is heuristic-based search, okay?

1449
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,380
 So is this a legal state?

1450
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:02,660
 Why?

1451
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:08,020
 Yeah, it's not, right?

1452
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:11,500
 So every state must be legal state.

1453
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:16,180
 And then also every movement must be a legal movement, okay?

1454
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:19,060
 Then you form this graph,

1455
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:23,940
 it's called the whole entire state space, okay?

1456
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,940
 Yeah, anything else I need to say?

1457
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:27,460
 Yeah, I think it's about it.

1458
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:29,900
 Okay, so this is a toy problem really, okay?

1459
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:34,019
 Eight puzzles, it's not that many states, okay?

1460
01:38:34,019 --> 01:38:37,259
 So this is another one, like a car diagnosis.

1461
01:38:37,259 --> 01:38:39,820
 Yeah, we're probably starting, where's the problem?

1462
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:41,299
 Okay, so suppose engine stopped,

1463
01:38:41,299 --> 01:38:44,500
 so we don't know what's the problem.

1464
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,299
 So we're starting from this state,

1465
01:38:46,299 --> 01:38:48,540
 and then we start to troubleshooting.

1466
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:50,900
 So to see engine trouble,

1467
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:54,660
 we need to see the engine can start or not.

1468
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,420
 Yeah, it can start, then you ask something else.

1469
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:59,420
 It cannot start, then you ask whether it's turned over,

1470
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:00,420
 blah, blah, blah, blah.

1471
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:05,420
 So this is checking the problem solving as well.

1472
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:08,820
 So each state is one of the possible states.

1473
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:10,700
 And then you also want to find the answer

1474
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:13,379
 from this search space.

1475
01:39:13,379 --> 01:39:18,019
 Okay, so you can see for symbolic AI,

1476
01:39:18,019 --> 01:39:19,780
 we need to define the symbol,

1477
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:23,540
 we need to define the space, state, state,

1478
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:26,519
 and then we have the state space,

1479
01:39:26,519 --> 01:39:31,179
 and then we should have initial knowledge or initial state,

1480
01:39:31,179 --> 01:39:34,820
 and we should have inference or the rules can be applied.

1481
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:37,860
 We should know how to define a move

1482
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:40,460
 from one place to another, right?

1483
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:42,179
 So that's why the state space

1484
01:39:42,179 --> 01:39:44,219
 is a collection of the problem states.

1485
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:49,099
 And the inference rule is how to apply the movement

1486
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:51,940
 from initial states to the others.

1487
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:56,940
 Okay, so basically we have representation,

1488
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,800
 we must have the operation rules,

1489
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:02,340
 and also we need to how to manipulate,

1490
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:04,020
 how to move around.

1491
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:05,580
 That's a key thing.

1492
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:08,820
 So yeah, I think this is also a good one.

1493
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:11,580
 So to say the problem in the beginning

1494
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:12,860
 is we have this problem.

1495
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:15,860
 So for example, we want to solve the A puzzle problem,

1496
01:40:16,179 --> 01:40:19,660
 we want to solve the TikTok problem or whatever.

1497
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:21,980
 And then we come up with abstraction, right?

1498
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:25,179
 So that is define the state and the state space,

1499
01:40:25,179 --> 01:40:26,940
 and then define the movement.

1500
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:29,019
 So that is a rules operation.

1501
01:40:29,019 --> 01:40:32,860
 And then we need to specify what is our starting state,

1502
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,620
 what is our goal, okay?

1503
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:37,480
 So which goal you want to achieve, okay?

1504
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,420
 And then we start to process.

1505
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,139
 So you can apply the search algorithm

1506
01:40:41,139 --> 01:40:44,639
 to find the path from the starting to the goal state.

1507
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:50,640
 Okay, very clear, very clear about how the symbolic AI

1508
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,640
 try to solve things.

1509
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:56,080
 Okay, so first thing is a large representation, right?

1510
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:59,060
 Yeah, in symbolic AI, just now I show you,

1511
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:01,620
 for example, use a symbol to represent it,

1512
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:04,240
 and then form the state and then move around.

1513
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:07,160
 But actually others, that is actually a graph, right?

1514
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,920
 The state space is a graph.

1515
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:13,560
 But other methods, like you can use like a predicate calculus.

1516
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,800
 So this is a formal language, very, very powerful

1517
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,880
 for logic reasoning, right?

1518
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,360
 Yeah, so can use this to do that.

1519
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:26,400
 That is actually take a lot of space

1520
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,680
 for the Ruger's book, early stage, okay?

1521
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,960
 Because we have Prologue, we have Lisp,

1522
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,360
 can support that, and they're very easy to describe

1523
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:37,760
 the things using the predicate calculus

1524
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:42,400
 and define the predicates and define the variables

1525
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:46,080
 and define the quantifiers, and then just use this

1526
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,599
 for reasoning purpose, okay?

1527
01:41:47,599 --> 01:41:50,559
 So you don't need a graph, you don't need a graph to search.

1528
01:41:50,559 --> 01:41:54,759
 Basically, you just use a logic, the formal logic

1529
01:41:54,759 --> 01:41:57,440
 to do the inference and the reasoning, okay?

1530
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,440
 Also programming, very easy.

1531
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:02,519
 The Prologue and Lisp is designed for that, okay?

1532
01:42:02,519 --> 01:42:06,639
 That's why early symbolic AI is very much on that,

1533
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:08,519
 very much, okay?

1534
01:42:08,519 --> 01:42:11,320
 That's why I mention this, but this is just purely

1535
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:13,000
 for your knowledge, purely for,

1536
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,040
 I'm not going to test you on this at all, okay?

1537
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:17,000
 That's a good thing.

1538
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:21,160
 So here is just an example, for example, you want to say,

1539
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:25,519
 you want to find out, you know, all cats has tails,

1540
01:42:25,519 --> 01:42:28,200
 and then you know Tom is a cat,

1541
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:31,440
 and then we know that Tom has tail, okay?

1542
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:35,000
 So you can use a predicate calculus to represent like this,

1543
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,440
 okay, and so you don't need to have a graph.

1544
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,839
 So you can see this, how easy to communicate

1545
01:42:40,839 --> 01:42:45,559
 with the computer, especially the language,

1546
01:42:45,559 --> 01:42:47,040
 specially designed for this.

1547
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:49,879
 Okay, how about this?

1548
01:42:51,879 --> 01:42:56,559
 So this is an example, also quite fun.

1549
01:42:56,559 --> 01:42:58,679
 Okay, so suppose there's a farmer here,

1550
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:01,519
 and then he has three possessions.

1551
01:43:01,519 --> 01:43:06,519
 One is a fork, one is a chick, one is a sack of grains, okay?

1552
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:10,560
 So he has a boat, so now he need to move

1553
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:15,560
 from left of the left of the river bank to the right, okay?

1554
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,120
 So what are the constraints here?

1555
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:21,920
 He cannot leave the chick with the grain,

1556
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,480
 because they will eat it, okay?

1557
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:28,400
 He cannot leave the fork with the chick alone, right?

1558
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,120
 Because forks will eat the chick.

1559
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,560
 And anything else?

1560
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:36,400
 Is that safe to leave the fork with the grain?

1561
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,080
 The fork won't eat it.

1562
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:42,080
 Okay, so you need to define, okay,

1563
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:46,920
 what are the possible rules for the movement?

1564
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,759
 And how are we going to represent it?

1565
01:43:50,599 --> 01:43:54,400
 So suppose we, yeah, the states actually can represent

1566
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:59,360
 in this form, left river bank, right bank, okay?

1567
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,879
 So that is items, so it can be a list of things

1568
01:44:02,879 --> 01:44:04,879
 on the left bank of the river,

1569
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,240
 and items on the right bank of the river.

1570
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,720
 So then you can, for each of these,

1571
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,480
 you can actually have, you know,

1572
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:17,480
 probably C to stand for chick, and F stand for fork,

1573
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:20,280
 grain, farmer, you know?

1574
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:23,080
 Every time you can only bring one item with you,

1575
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:25,720
 or you can don't bring anything else, okay?

1576
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:27,840
 Okay, so then you need to specify,

1577
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,120
 what's the initial state, right?

1578
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:33,600
 So initially, suppose we assume everybody

1579
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:37,840
 on the left side of the river, okay, left bank.

1580
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:41,760
 So that's why those items, everything on the left,

1581
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:45,120
 and right is nothing, okay?

1582
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:49,560
 And then in the end, goal state is nothing on the left,

1583
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:52,880
 now everything on the right, okay?

1584
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,240
 So one possible state, is this okay?

1585
01:44:56,640 --> 01:45:01,640
 The fork with the grain, and farmer with chick, can?

1586
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:04,080
 Can, yeah, can.

1587
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:08,520
 So we can represent this, okay?

1588
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:11,800
 So like, we can have a starting state like this,

1589
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,040
 and then we can have a goal state like this,

1590
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,800
 and then we can have movement,

1591
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:18,520
 and then we can draw the space, okay?

1592
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,960
 And then you can see what is the best way to find the answer.

1593
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,240
 Okay, so that is the problem solving,

1594
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:29,480
 to see how to move from the left to the right.

1595
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:34,280
 Yeah, so for example, we can say,

1596
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:37,160
 so take the grain with you, so is this okay?

1597
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:42,000
 The farm take the grain, and then another side

1598
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:47,000
 is left the chicken with the farm, or fox, cannot, right?

1599
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:51,360
 So this is will be eaten, so this is illegal state,

1600
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,959
 so not allowed, and this another illegal state.

1601
01:45:54,959 --> 01:45:57,320
 So this is possible state, okay?

1602
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:59,400
 So only collect those possible state,

1603
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,400
 that form your state space, okay?

1604
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:07,400
 And then you can find the solution from initial state

1605
01:46:07,639 --> 01:46:12,639
 to reach the goal states, okay?

1606
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,960
 So how neural network or numerical AI

1607
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,679
 doing the representation?

1608
01:46:22,679 --> 01:46:24,920
 And just quick recap, because I like to you

1609
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,639
 to associate these two, okay?

1610
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:29,360
 So you can see the big difference,

1611
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:32,320
 we are talking about eight puzzle problem.

1612
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:37,320
 Okay, so this is symbolic way to write it, numerical way.

1613
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,120
 Right, so yeah, you probably use a vector

1614
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:47,920
 to represent these states, and then multi-layer,

1615
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:51,280
 many, many layers, and then you want the output layer,

1616
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:57,440
 to, I don't know, this is what kind of problem?

1617
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:03,160
 It's not really classification association,

1618
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:06,320
 but you need to learn the representation.

1619
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:09,040
 So in the end, those weights value

1620
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:13,760
 are the representation of the association, right?

1621
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:17,200
 So this is a deep neural network approach,

1622
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,520
 so you can see it's totally data-driven.

1623
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:23,360
 It's no abstraction, you see?

1624
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,080
 You see the key difference?

1625
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:28,760
 So the key difference, coming up with this representation,

1626
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:31,559
 you need to have a skill, you need to know.

1627
01:47:31,559 --> 01:47:34,320
 That's why we say at early stage,

1628
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:37,840
 normally the one, the person design the chess game can,

1629
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,320
 like for example, IBM, they win,

1630
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:43,440
 the Deep Blue actually win the world champion.

1631
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:48,440
 The designer, he is a very good chess player, right?

1632
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:52,480
 So he know, he have the knowledge and skills

1633
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:56,599
 to design the program in a way which can work well.

1634
01:47:56,599 --> 01:47:59,959
 Okay, because he make, definitely have to use a hints,

1635
01:47:59,959 --> 01:48:02,200
 definitely have to have a heuristic value.

1636
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,839
 Now, cannot use exhaustive search, right?

1637
01:48:06,559 --> 01:48:10,919
 Okay, okay, so we have representation,

1638
01:48:10,919 --> 01:48:13,240
 then we have the state space,

1639
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:17,799
 and normally the state space will form a graph, a graph.

1640
01:48:17,799 --> 01:48:21,799
 Okay, so then we say search, right?

1641
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:25,400
 Okay, so hopefully using the graph,

1642
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:29,800
 the graph theory can help us to do some search,

1643
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:33,240
 can help us to do some theoretical analysis.

1644
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:37,200
 Okay, so that is a point I want to address here.

1645
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:42,200
 Okay, so you see river, so this is Konoski problem,

1646
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:49,240
 so very famous about this bridge and seven bridges,

1647
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:52,519
 and also the river and two river bank,

1648
01:48:52,519 --> 01:48:55,519
 and then two islands here, okay?

1649
01:48:55,519 --> 01:49:00,519
 So suppose we want to visit, we want to plan a trip

1650
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:05,260
 which can cover each of the bridge once and only once.

1651
01:49:06,599 --> 01:49:08,880
 Then we ask ourselves, is that possible?

1652
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,280
 Is that possible to do it?

1653
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,080
 Can we write a program to do it?

1654
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:17,920
 Yeah, sure, we can, actually, we can easily convert

1655
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:21,280
 to the representation, graph representation, right?

1656
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:26,280
 Each of these river bank use a note in the graph, right?

1657
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:31,280
 So river bank one, river bank two,

1658
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,920
 and then island one, and island two,

1659
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,640
 and then seven bridges, so are the arcs, right?

1660
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,600
 So this is naturally matched with the graph.

1661
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,720
 And then after we have this graph,

1662
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:45,480
 then yeah, we can draw on the graph,

1663
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:49,280
 like okay, we can start,

1664
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:53,360
 suppose we think we are able to design algorithm

1665
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,120
 which can actually help us to,

1666
01:49:57,759 --> 01:50:00,360
 can go through this bridge once only.

1667
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:03,080
 So for example, we start from the river bank one,

1668
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:05,280
 then we cross the bridge three,

1669
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,580
 then cross the bridge two once only,

1670
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:13,580
 and then four, and then D1, and then up to Asan,

1671
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:17,140
 maybe we go through six, and then five,

1672
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:22,420
 almost all, but miss out this, right?

1673
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:25,180
 Yeah, so then we start from another location,

1674
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:27,500
 maybe we say, oh, go this way, blah, blah,

1675
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:30,900
 you know, you can exhaustively try, sure, you can try,

1676
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:33,059
 but then you probably try many times,

1677
01:50:33,059 --> 01:50:35,100
 and then there is no answer,

1678
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:38,220
 there is no solution to match.

1679
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:42,780
 Okay, so hopefully we don't need to go this kind of,

1680
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:45,059
 make such effort, waste our effort, right?

1681
01:50:45,059 --> 01:50:48,019
 So is there any theory can help us

1682
01:50:48,019 --> 01:50:51,059
 to do analysis in advance?

1683
01:50:51,059 --> 01:50:54,460
 Yeah, so that's why our mathematician provide this,

1684
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:59,460
 so the graph actually by the mathematician,

1685
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:02,179
 yeah, actually tell us certain things

1686
01:51:02,179 --> 01:51:04,099
 about this particular graph.

1687
01:51:04,099 --> 01:51:09,099
 Okay, look at the number of the nodes

1688
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:14,500
 which has odd number of the connections, okay?

1689
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:18,900
 So this is one, two, three, four, five, right?

1690
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:23,900
 So we have one node which has odd number of the edges.

1691
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:26,540
 This also three, right?

1692
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:30,340
 We have two, we have three, we have four.

1693
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:34,620
 Four nodes all have odd number of the connections.

1694
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:36,860
 So based on his theory,

1695
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:39,860
 his theory actually tell us

1696
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:44,860
 you can only have zero or two odd nodes,

1697
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:48,980
 then possibly you can solve the problem.

1698
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:51,460
 Okay, so this one we have four.

1699
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:52,900
 So is that possible?

1700
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,340
 The answer is no.

1701
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:56,140
 So no answer for this.

1702
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:58,820
 We don't need to waste our time for that.

1703
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:01,500
 Okay, so that's the nice thing of, you know,

1704
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:05,020
 with when we come back to this representation,

1705
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:06,540
 now we make use of the graph theory

1706
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:10,580
 to help us to make decision.

1707
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:14,140
 Okay, yeah, so this is one about the graph.

1708
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:15,540
 Then we have nodes, we have arcs,

1709
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:17,300
 so those is converting.

1710
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:20,420
 And then the strategy is to search, right?

1711
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:23,780
 So just now we say, yeah, the programmers ability

1712
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:27,760
 actually is a one play very important role.

1713
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:31,420
 So that's why we say the computer or the AI,

1714
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:37,420
 actually who gave the soul to the code or to the program?

1715
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:39,380
 Still the designer, right?

1716
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:42,860
 The designer still keep the most important thing.

1717
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:44,580
 But not nowaday, right?

1718
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:49,060
 Data driven, data driven is no longer that way.

1719
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:51,940
 Okay, but the symbolic AI, yes.

1720
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:52,780
 Okay.

1721
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:58,940
 Yeah, so we have this, what is this?

1722
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:02,059
 Oh yeah, graph theory can be used to analysis structure

1723
01:53:02,059 --> 01:53:05,019
 and then complexity of both the problem

1724
01:53:05,019 --> 01:53:07,099
 and also procedure to solve it.

1725
01:53:07,099 --> 01:53:12,099
 Okay, so this is Euler rules here.

1726
01:53:16,339 --> 01:53:20,219
 The conclusion, okay, say unless a graph

1727
01:53:20,219 --> 01:53:25,219
 contain exactly zero or two nodes of the odd degree,

1728
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:27,540
 then it's possible to work through.

1729
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:29,580
 Okay, otherwise it's not possible.

1730
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:31,580
 So just now we check we have four, right?

1731
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:36,580
 Four nodes with odd degree, so cannot.

1732
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:38,940
 Yeah, how about this one?

1733
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:47,060
 This graph can be each of the green edges

1734
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:50,060
 of bridge can be visits once and only once?

1735
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,540
 And why?

1736
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:58,540
 Try starting from here, go this way, this way,

1737
01:54:04,019 --> 01:54:07,980
 this way, this way, yeah?

1738
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:08,820
 Can.

1739
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:16,460
 So is this matching with Euler theory?

1740
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:25,380
 Matching?

1741
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:30,740
 How many odd, how many nodes with odd degree?

1742
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:35,019
 Zero, so yes.

1743
01:54:35,019 --> 01:54:37,700
 Okay, good, we have the theory to support.

1744
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:41,860
 So give us a confidence, we can, yeah, we can do it.

1745
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:45,100
 Okay, so that's why, so what is graph?

1746
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:46,900
 Okay, there's no need to talk loud.

1747
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:47,740
 What is a graph?

1748
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:52,220
 You all know nodes have graph, the connections,

1749
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:54,340
 the edges or arc.

1750
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:56,140
 Then the tree is a special one.

1751
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:58,940
 Tree is, you know, to any nodes,

1752
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:01,140
 you can only have one path to reach it.

1753
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:04,420
 Okay, so it's a special case of the graph.

1754
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:08,900
 So you have children, have parents, these kind of siblings.

1755
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:12,660
 Okay, so space-based approach to problem solving.

1756
01:55:12,660 --> 01:55:14,940
 Basically, you have the nodes, you have the arc,

1757
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:16,740
 and then you have the state space,

1758
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:18,540
 and then you need to search,

1759
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:20,300
 and then finding solution paths

1760
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:22,540
 from the starting nodes to the goal nodes.

1761
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:25,940
 Okay, so that is the symbolic AI

1762
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:28,660
 that we represented in graph.

1763
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:33,660
 Okay, and now let's look at this tic-tac-toe problem.

1764
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:38,060
 Okay, so tic-tac-toes, we have cross,

1765
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:39,500
 and we have circle, right?

1766
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:43,860
 Initially, yeah, nine positions empty,

1767
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:48,780
 and then, so who, probably the cross is the first player.

1768
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:52,780
 So cross can put in nine places, right?

1769
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:57,780
 Yeah, any of the place legal, right?

1770
01:55:58,219 --> 01:56:01,380
 Yeah, either on the corner, so you have four choice.

1771
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:06,380
 One corner, one corner, another corner, another corner, right?

1772
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:10,660
 And then you can put in the middle, another four, right?

1773
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:13,019
 So, and also you can, sorry, sorry,

1774
01:56:13,019 --> 01:56:15,259
 middle of the row or columns.

1775
01:56:15,259 --> 01:56:18,420
 And then you can also put into the very much the center,

1776
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:20,060
 right, so total nine.

1777
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:21,500
 And then after you put this,

1778
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:24,900
 then the player is a circle player turn.

1779
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:26,900
 So because you take one space already,

1780
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:30,220
 then I only have eight places to put my circle, right?

1781
01:56:31,180 --> 01:56:32,500
 So this is how you play.

1782
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:35,020
 And then in the end, yeah, of course,

1783
01:56:35,020 --> 01:56:36,900
 whoever they want to win, right?

1784
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:40,300
 So they link up the whole row, or link up the diagonal,

1785
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:42,500
 or link up the whole vertical.

1786
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:46,320
 Yeah, so total, this is a total possible movement.

1787
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:51,320
 Okay, so looks big, but still small,

1788
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:56,320
 still manageable, very much manageable size for computer.

1789
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:03,320
 And so this is, you know, example to show us

1790
01:57:03,519 --> 01:57:05,719
 how we should have a note, then we have arc,

1791
01:57:05,719 --> 01:57:09,440
 and then we have a state, starting state, and then go state.

1792
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:13,240
 So again, again, I try to show this.

1793
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:15,920
 So then starting from here,

1794
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,000
 if you want to win, then probably you should put

1795
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,560
 in the center, and then suppose the opponent puts

1796
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,160
 on the right-hand side, now I should move

1797
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:28,880
 to the left top corner.

1798
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:33,640
 I put here, likely, unless they put here,

1799
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:36,280
 otherwise I can win the case, right?

1800
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:39,480
 So this is the possible movement.

1801
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:45,520
 Okay, yeah, so the puzzle, so now we can have

1802
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:51,120
 15, so four by four, so you have 15 number,

1803
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:55,400
 number the tower, plus one empty tower.

1804
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:59,520
 Okay, so again, you can only move up, left, right, down,

1805
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,600
 or something like four kind of movement.

1806
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:06,160
 So this eight puzzle problem, and then the goal is,

1807
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:11,440
 so suppose the goal is moving the towers in and out

1808
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:15,180
 in the bank space, and depend on, you can define,

1809
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:17,580
 you want to sort it, or you want to, you know,

1810
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:20,500
 depends what is your goal state, and you can specify.

1811
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:23,580
 Yeah, so,

1812
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:29,340
 so this is actually, state space is larger

1813
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:34,020
 than the tic-tac-toe, okay, but still probably manageable.

1814
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:38,460
 And then probably the state space will be more like

1815
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:42,820
 graph rather than a tree, that means have loop back, okay.

1816
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:47,820
 Yeah, like what we have, you know, this can be,

1817
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:50,660
 go back there, then become a graph, okay,

1818
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:53,099
 but of course you can also don't allow this,

1819
01:58:53,099 --> 01:58:54,620
 there is a tree, okay.

1820
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:02,340
 Ah, so we can have some exercise on this, okay,

1821
01:59:03,019 --> 01:59:06,299
 so can like take a look at this.

1822
01:59:06,299 --> 01:59:09,580
 So we had the puzzle, we had the tic-tac-toe,

1823
01:59:09,580 --> 01:59:13,980
 we had the farmer and the positions,

1824
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:15,740
 now we look at another problem,

1825
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:19,160
 which is also symbolic, AI can solve.

1826
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:24,000
 Okay, so suppose we are given two jars, water jar, okay,

1827
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,500
 so one is four liter, it can contain four liter water,

1828
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:30,480
 another one is three liter water,

1829
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:34,019
 and there is no reading for each of jar, so we don't know.

1830
01:59:34,019 --> 01:59:36,980
 We only know full or empty, okay.

1831
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:41,139
 And then a water tap is provided, so we can refill,

1832
01:59:41,139 --> 01:59:43,019
 and also that's a drain available,

1833
01:59:43,019 --> 01:59:44,820
 so we can pull water out,

1834
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:47,099
 so those are the things available.

1835
01:59:47,099 --> 01:59:52,099
 And then we, the goal or the aim of this problem is

1836
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:58,860
 we want to get exactly two liter of water in the jar full,

1837
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:02,120
 okay, that means four liter jar.

1838
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:08,120
 So, so, we cannot estimate, cannot say, ah, estimate half,

1839
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:11,180
 okay, no, cannot do that.

1840
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:16,180
 So we need to use a proper way to throw away or fill up,

1841
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:19,440
 and to achieve the goal, okay.

1842
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:22,200
 So suppose state representation,

1843
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:26,700
 we suggest you use this X and Y to denote respectively

1844
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:29,500
 the jar full or jar free, okay,

1845
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:32,620
 and then we can have an initial state,

1846
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:36,140
 so initial state you can, up to you,

1847
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:38,420
 you can initialize equal to zero zero,

1848
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:42,660
 so both jars empty, or you can even full, you know,

1849
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:46,420
 up to you, okay, you can assume initial state.

1850
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:47,620
 The goal state is what?

1851
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:50,140
 What is the goal state?

1852
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:58,460
 Two, did they say anything about jar full, jar free?

1853
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:00,940
 No, so it can be anything in jar free,

1854
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:05,980
 but we only care about jar full is two, okay.

1855
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:09,700
 So anything in the jar free can be okay,

1856
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:12,780
 that consider one of the goal states.

1857
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:16,040
 So write down the initial state, goal state,

1858
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:20,140
 and then list out all the legal movements,

1859
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:22,820
 or operation, or manipulation.

1860
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:27,820
 So, for example, fill up, you know, jar full from the tap,

1861
02:01:28,340 --> 02:01:32,660
 or empty jar free into drain,

1862
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:36,019
 or empty jar full into drain,

1863
02:01:36,019 --> 02:01:40,259
 or pull over, you know, from one jar to another,

1864
02:01:40,259 --> 02:01:44,740
 this all legal, okay, write down all the legal movement,

1865
02:01:44,740 --> 02:01:47,259
 and then try to draw this graph.

1866
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:54,700
 Your turn, quick exercise for that,

1867
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:58,900
 and we can check the answer soon.

1868
02:02:07,099 --> 02:02:09,340
 So we are not just learning theory,

1869
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:11,599
 we are having some exercise now.

1870
02:02:15,099 --> 02:02:17,660
 Drawing, do some drawing.

1871
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:28,260
 So I suggest we all have zero, zero to start,

1872
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:32,620
 and then goal state is two, zero, how about that?

1873
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:55,780
 Any question?

1874
02:02:57,380 --> 02:02:58,380
 You can try.

1875
02:03:24,700 --> 02:03:25,540
 Okay.

1876
02:03:54,700 --> 02:03:55,540
 Okay.

1877
02:04:24,700 --> 02:04:25,540
 Okay.

1878
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:55,540
 Okay.

1879
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:25,540
 Okay.

1880
02:05:54,700 --> 02:05:55,540
 Okay.

1881
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:25,540
 Okay.

1882
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:55,540
 Okay.

1883
02:07:24,700 --> 02:07:25,540
 Okay.

1884
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:55,540
 Okay.

1885
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:25,540
 Okay.

1886
02:08:36,380 --> 02:08:41,019
 Okay, so, yeah, we can have one, like,

1887
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:45,900
 very commonly we can believe starting from,

1888
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:48,860
 the starting state is zero, zero, right?

1889
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:52,420
 Or anything, it's also possible starting state,

1890
02:08:52,420 --> 02:08:54,500
 as long as the i is less than four,

1891
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:56,780
 and the j is less than three, right?

1892
02:08:56,780 --> 02:08:57,840
 Possible starting.

1893
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:05,900
 Can be equal, yeah, actually can be equal to zero,

1894
02:09:05,900 --> 02:09:08,940
 but I just say this already separated out.

1895
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:12,940
 So then this one is, if you don't consider zero,

1896
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:16,540
 actually can be here zero, zero.

1897
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:21,140
 Okay, then goal, this is, can be one goal,

1898
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:23,660
 can be like this, right?

1899
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:27,340
 You want the two, little water in the jar four,

1900
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:30,380
 anything in the jar three, doesn't matter.

1901
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:34,500
 Okay, so those are the possible six operations.

1902
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:39,500
 Yeah, so we build up like this, or transfer like this,

1903
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:46,940
 and then we can show something like this, right?

1904
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:52,940
 So initially zero, zero, and then if you apply rule one,

1905
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:54,299
 then you get this.

1906
02:09:54,299 --> 02:09:57,700
 If you apply rule three, you get this.

1907
02:09:57,700 --> 02:10:00,339
 From here, you apply rule six,

1908
02:10:00,339 --> 02:10:05,339
 which is transfer the four to the jar three,

1909
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:08,259
 and reach this, yeah?

1910
02:10:08,259 --> 02:10:13,259
 So this one, from zero to, is it possible from zero, three,

1911
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:14,980
 to two, one?

1912
02:10:17,700 --> 02:10:18,620
 Is that possible?

1913
02:10:20,299 --> 02:10:22,860
 Not possible, yeah.

1914
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:25,620
 You don't know which rule to apply, right?

1915
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:28,179
 Can we apply any rule?

1916
02:10:29,299 --> 02:10:31,980
 Definitely not this one, definitely not this one.

1917
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:34,900
 Not this one, not this one, right?

1918
02:10:34,900 --> 02:10:36,980
 Because empty, this is not empty,

1919
02:10:36,980 --> 02:10:39,780
 still have one little inside.

1920
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:43,860
 Transfer, oh yeah, actually here say transfer,

1921
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:45,700
 need to say transfer everything,

1922
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:48,500
 or transfer part of it.

1923
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:50,780
 But you cannot say part of it,

1924
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:53,300
 it can be exactly two, right, cannot measure.

1925
02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:55,780
 So this is not legal.

1926
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:57,740
 Okay, good.

1927
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:00,860
 Here is one possible answer.

1928
02:11:10,380 --> 02:11:11,820
 So this is two, three.

1929
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:15,780
 Yeah, those are not.

1930
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:24,820
 So anyway, this is just one possible answer,

1931
02:11:24,820 --> 02:11:27,059
 you have many others, okay.

1932
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:34,219
 Okay, so you know how to do, huh?

1933
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:35,060
 Okay.

1934
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:41,820
 And continue our discussion.

1935
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:47,020
 Okay, so suppose we have this graph for another example,

1936
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:52,020
 self-travelers, traveling salesman problem, TSP.

1937
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:58,260
 Okay, so yeah, so you have five cities,

1938
02:11:58,260 --> 02:12:03,260
 and then those are the shortest paths to visit, oh sorry.

1939
02:12:04,540 --> 02:12:06,420
 We want to find the shortest path

1940
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:08,940
 to visit all the five cities, okay.

1941
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:13,500
 Each city only visit once, return to the original city.

1942
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:14,740
 So is that possible?

1943
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:16,700
 So when we look at this graph,

1944
02:12:16,700 --> 02:12:19,300
 then first question is to ask ourselves,

1945
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:21,140
 just like the bridge, okay.

1946
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:22,740
 So is that possible to do this?

1947
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:26,260
 Yeah, any odd notes?

1948
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:30,260
 Yeah, no, so it's zero, so it's possible.

1949
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:32,100
 Okay, then we want to find,

1950
02:12:32,140 --> 02:12:36,140
 so it's possible to visit all the cities once

1951
02:12:36,140 --> 02:12:37,820
 and only once, yeah.

1952
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:41,900
 But then this question is not only once and only once,

1953
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:44,140
 but also the shortest one.

1954
02:12:44,140 --> 02:12:49,140
 Okay, so we need to figure out all the possible way,

1955
02:12:50,260 --> 02:12:53,740
 visit all the five places once and only once,

1956
02:12:53,740 --> 02:12:56,940
 and then we compare which one give us the shortest,

1957
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:59,900
 and then that is the answer, okay.

1958
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:04,139
 Yeah, so possible, and then we find the shortest one.

1959
02:13:04,139 --> 02:13:09,139
 Yeah, so here, this is like, yeah, starting from A,

1960
02:13:09,820 --> 02:13:14,820
 then go to B, so this is miles or whatever, kilometers,

1961
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:21,620
 so all the cost, okay, so we indicate along the edge.

1962
02:13:21,620 --> 02:13:25,980
 And then this is to the C, and to D, to E,

1963
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:29,099
 you know, we attach with, based on the graph,

1964
02:13:29,140 --> 02:13:32,500
 and then we work out, so add up,

1965
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:35,180
 and then we know which one is the shortest, right,

1966
02:13:36,180 --> 02:13:37,200
 the total cost.

1967
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:42,020
 Okay, so this is exhaustive search, kind of, okay,

1968
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:46,100
 you have the whole space, and then you can find the answer

1969
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:49,700
 later by exhaustive search, you can get the answer.

1970
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:54,340
 So now you can see, I hope from there you can see

1971
02:13:54,340 --> 02:13:58,140
 the search strategy is very important, right.

1972
02:13:58,140 --> 02:14:02,540
 So that is six, five cities is really a toy problem.

1973
02:14:02,540 --> 02:14:05,180
 We talk about 100 cities, for example,

1974
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:09,340
 then the space will be expanded hugely.

1975
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:13,680
 Yeah, so that's why strategy behind this is important.

1976
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:20,740
 So there are a few things to pay attention to.

1977
02:14:20,740 --> 02:14:24,220
 One is to see whether it's a completeness.

1978
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:28,060
 That means if the strategy can always help us

1979
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:31,260
 to find a solution, if this solution exists.

1980
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:36,300
 And then another one is time complexity.

1981
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:38,660
 That means how fast you can do.

1982
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:41,700
 And then space complexity, now do you need to store

1983
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:45,200
 everything, or you can store partially things?

1984
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:48,500
 Another thing is whether it's optimal.

1985
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:52,580
 So that is, can we find the least cost one?

1986
02:14:52,580 --> 02:14:57,580
 So that is a way to judge which is a better strategy.

1987
02:14:58,460 --> 02:15:03,460
 So the complexity we try to see, the BHA is talking about

1988
02:15:05,019 --> 02:15:08,580
 branch factor, the depths and the maximum depths.

1989
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:11,700
 So I think this is purely for your information,

1990
02:15:11,700 --> 02:15:13,700
 we are not going to test you on this.

1991
02:15:13,700 --> 02:15:16,620
 So it's just basic knowledge.

1992
02:15:16,620 --> 02:15:20,620
 Basically we would know two type of search.

1993
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:25,300
 One is totally exhaustive blind search,

1994
02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:28,180
 or un-informed search.

1995
02:15:28,180 --> 02:15:31,380
 So how to systematically search to find answer.

1996
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:32,500
 Another one is informed.

1997
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:35,700
 So informed is a heuristic-based search.

1998
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:38,300
 So we are going to cover other search methods.

1999
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:42,580
 Exhaustive and also the most popular one,

2000
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:44,940
 and also the heuristic one.

2001
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:51,420
 Then another thing is about the data-driven and goal-driven.

2002
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:53,220
 This is a big strategy.

2003
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:54,800
 Which direction to go?

2004
02:15:55,500 --> 02:16:00,140
 So data-driven meaning we start from the facts.

2005
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:03,540
 We start from the knowledge, the partial knowledge we have.

2006
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:07,220
 Start from there, then you try to find the answer,

2007
02:16:07,220 --> 02:16:08,820
 the solution, the goal.

2008
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:10,460
 So this is a direction.

2009
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:13,060
 We're based on facts and based on the rule.

2010
02:16:13,060 --> 02:16:14,540
 The rule we defined it.

2011
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:17,420
 And then we get the new knowledge or updated knowledge

2012
02:16:17,420 --> 02:16:20,660
 and then move on until we find the answer.

2013
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:25,660
 So this is so-called forward search.

2014
02:16:25,660 --> 02:16:27,340
 Forward, go forward.

2015
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:31,820
 So this is a data-driven.

2016
02:16:33,020 --> 02:16:36,780
 Data-driven in symbolic AI context.

2017
02:16:37,619 --> 02:16:41,379
 It's not the data-driven in numerical AI.

2018
02:16:41,379 --> 02:16:45,080
 Then the goal-driven search is other way around.

2019
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:49,500
 We start from one of the winning states, for example.

2020
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:53,580
 Then go backwards to see what is the sub-goal.

2021
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:56,180
 And then from the sub-goal, backwards.

2022
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:57,379
 Try to find.

2023
02:16:57,379 --> 02:17:00,540
 And then in the end, can we find all the facts

2024
02:17:00,540 --> 02:17:02,340
 which support the case?

2025
02:17:03,379 --> 02:17:05,379
 Okay, so that is the direction.

2026
02:17:05,379 --> 02:17:08,379
 So starting from goal, then see the facts,

2027
02:17:08,379 --> 02:17:11,299
 and then get the sub-goal, then search backwards,

2028
02:17:11,299 --> 02:17:14,420
 and then see the back to the facts.

2029
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:17,420
 So if you find it, then that means

2030
02:17:18,299 --> 02:17:19,980
 you find the supporting factor.

2031
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:27,980
 So here, whether which one we should apply,

2032
02:17:28,860 --> 02:17:31,379
 this depends on the situation.

2033
02:17:31,379 --> 02:17:34,500
 So both is, we are talking about search

2034
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:37,340
 on the same state space.

2035
02:17:37,340 --> 02:17:39,139
 So given the same state space,

2036
02:17:39,139 --> 02:17:41,540
 which direction you should search.

2037
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:45,379
 So the same space, same state space.

2038
02:17:45,379 --> 02:17:48,099
 Then the sequence, the number of the visits,

2039
02:17:48,099 --> 02:17:51,459
 the state visits will be different,

2040
02:17:51,459 --> 02:17:53,500
 if you use a different strategy.

2041
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:55,500
 So of course we should prefer the strategy

2042
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:59,740
 which in the end, we can quickly find the answer.

2043
02:18:01,539 --> 02:18:05,019
 Sometimes it's a hybrid, meet in the middle.

2044
02:18:05,019 --> 02:18:07,539
 So you have starting from goal, for example,

2045
02:18:07,539 --> 02:18:12,539
 forwards and then also from the, sorry, from data,

2046
02:18:12,539 --> 02:18:13,859
 and then also from goal,

2047
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:15,900
 and then try to meet in the middle.

2048
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:17,420
 So that is a hybrid one.

2049
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:24,580
 So yeah, so if you think those are the data available,

2050
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:27,900
 and those are the goals, and then you go this direction,

2051
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:31,300
 or you go that direction, depends on the space.

2052
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:33,460
 Same space we are talking about.

2053
02:18:33,460 --> 02:18:38,460
 And then we can see which direction is more efficient.

2054
02:18:38,740 --> 02:18:43,500
 So this is talking about without much of the heretics,

2055
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:47,340
 more about the exhaustive search.

2056
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:50,780
 Okay, so one example here.

2057
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:55,260
 Confirm or deny the statements.

2058
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:58,139
 Suppose your friend is called John,

2059
02:18:58,139 --> 02:19:01,500
 and want to check whether he's,

2060
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:08,020
 Tom is his great, great, great, great, great, great father.

2061
02:19:09,620 --> 02:19:12,940
 So 10 generations apart, for example.

2062
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:14,420
 We are checking that.

2063
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:19,060
 So one to confirm or deny.

2064
02:19:19,940 --> 02:19:23,500
 So this is talking about 250 years ago,

2065
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:25,580
 10 generations apart.

2066
02:19:25,580 --> 02:19:28,900
 So we see Tom on the top is the data,

2067
02:19:28,900 --> 02:19:32,540
 and then the goal is on the bottom is John.

2068
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:37,540
 Okay, so we want to see whether this match there.

2069
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:40,940
 So which direction should we go?

2070
02:19:41,940 --> 02:19:45,100
 We are talking about the same search space.

2071
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:51,500
 So suppose, yeah, Tom have three kids.

2072
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:56,460
 And then each kids have another three kids, and so on.

2073
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:04,700
 And normally, each person will have two parents.

2074
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:08,500
 We don't talk about step parents or whatever.

2075
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:11,340
 We just talk about two biological parents.

2076
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:16,420
 So which way you think is more efficient?

2077
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:20,100
 10 generations apart.

2078
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:30,660
 So if we start from data,

2079
02:20:31,940 --> 02:20:34,180
 then we search three person, right?

2080
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:36,300
 I mean, depends on how many children they have.

2081
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:39,460
 So suppose average, each person have three children.

2082
02:20:40,779 --> 02:20:42,660
 Okay, so three.

2083
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:46,500
 And then each of these have three.

2084
02:20:48,179 --> 02:20:52,140
 So this is the first generation, second generation,

2085
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:54,699
 third generation, fourth, 10.

2086
02:20:55,580 --> 02:21:00,580
 So that is the number of the search you need to conduct.

2087
02:21:01,220 --> 02:21:02,420
 To conduct, right?

2088
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:05,900
 Yeah, what if you start from here?

2089
02:21:08,980 --> 02:21:12,580
 Then parents, parents.

2090
02:21:12,580 --> 02:21:14,980
 Oh, I didn't draw another parent.

2091
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:22,380
 Yeah, so maybe, yeah, I didn't draw,

2092
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:24,820
 say this is a parent.

2093
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:28,220
 Oh no, no, no, cannot be, this is children.

2094
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:31,980
 So you have another parent, which is somewhere here.

2095
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:33,939
 So each one, you search the parents,

2096
02:21:33,939 --> 02:21:37,260
 and then each search parents again, like that.

2097
02:21:42,099 --> 02:21:47,099
 Is this 10 generation will be the search ancestors

2098
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:50,900
 will be two to the power of 10, right?

2099
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:52,539
 So if you're starting from data,

2100
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:56,900
 there will be average number of the children

2101
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:59,100
 to the power of 10.

2102
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:04,779
 So depends on average number of children.

2103
02:22:04,779 --> 02:22:08,699
 If it's only one children, which way to go?

2104
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:14,900
 Everybody only have one child.

2105
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:21,500
 One, one, one, right?

2106
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:22,859
 Go this way, data driven.

2107
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:27,180
 Yeah, but if it's three,

2108
02:22:31,620 --> 02:22:33,500
 then you have a three to the power of one,

2109
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:37,100
 three to the power of two, three to the power of three,

2110
02:22:37,100 --> 02:22:39,940
 until three to the power of 10, right?

2111
02:22:39,940 --> 02:22:42,220
 In order to find John.

2112
02:22:44,140 --> 02:22:46,180
 So better go this way, right?

2113
02:22:46,180 --> 02:22:47,980
 Yeah, so this is the idea.

2114
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:51,820
 So if the n is greater than two,

2115
02:22:51,820 --> 02:22:53,699
 so that means three, for example,

2116
02:22:53,699 --> 02:22:57,260
 then it's better to do from the

2117
02:22:58,900 --> 02:23:03,300
 go to the backwards, okay?

2118
02:23:05,060 --> 02:23:08,539
 But suppose we don't know,

2119
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:15,619
 yeah, we don't know the,

2120
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:21,300
 the parents.

2121
02:23:24,940 --> 02:23:27,900
 We only have the, okay, come back to this.

2122
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:32,420
 We only know a lot about each person who are their children.

2123
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:38,860
 Then looks like we don't have much choice, right?

2124
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:40,060
 We have to go this way.

2125
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:44,980
 Because each person probably don't know their parents.

2126
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:47,220
 Anyway, yeah, it's a bit strange,

2127
02:23:47,220 --> 02:23:49,939
 but it's just, we are saying,

2128
02:23:49,939 --> 02:23:53,100
 depends on the situation, how much data you have.

2129
02:23:54,140 --> 02:23:56,020
 But efficiency wise, yeah,

2130
02:23:56,020 --> 02:23:58,220
 we look at which direction is better.

2131
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:08,619
 So this is one about data driven, goal driven.

2132
02:24:08,619 --> 02:24:10,740
 Then we can have a practice on this.

2133
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:13,740
 This is our exercise two.

2134
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:20,980
 So like goal play, okay, we play goal.

2135
02:24:24,980 --> 02:24:29,980
 Goal play, should we go data driven or goal driven?

2136
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:32,740
 Or medical diagnosis,

2137
02:24:32,740 --> 02:24:34,820
 I mean medical diagnosis is easier,

2138
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:38,100
 like think about medical diagnosis.

2139
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:39,539
 Which direction should we go?

2140
02:24:42,380 --> 02:24:44,220
 Data are those symptoms.

2141
02:24:45,220 --> 02:24:48,820
 The goal of those disease.

2142
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:52,020
 Okay, so suppose like a COVID.

2143
02:24:53,660 --> 02:24:58,580
 Then what kind of symptom can support this is COVID?

2144
02:25:03,260 --> 02:25:04,900
 So which way would be better?

2145
02:25:08,260 --> 02:25:09,539
 Can think about that.

2146
02:25:10,539 --> 02:25:12,580
 Okay, okay, go back and think.

2147
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:15,380
 I think today we had a quite long day already,

2148
02:25:15,380 --> 02:25:16,220
 I should stop.

2149
02:25:17,740 --> 02:25:21,220
 Summarize first, okay, summarize what we had today.

2150
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:27,140
 So other than the introduction about definition

2151
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:29,940
 and brief history, I think that is more

2152
02:25:29,940 --> 02:25:34,539
 just for your interest and basic idea.

2153
02:25:34,539 --> 02:25:36,539
 And also your homework is to go back

2154
02:25:36,539 --> 02:25:41,539
 and watch the YouTube about what is AI.

2155
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:43,580
 Okay, you can watch that.

2156
02:25:43,580 --> 02:25:48,180
 And then the summary on the more technical stuff today

2157
02:25:48,180 --> 02:25:51,660
 we covered in the lecture two and three.

2158
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:56,380
 Okay, so we want to define what is a symbolic AI.

2159
02:25:57,580 --> 02:26:01,060
 And then what is a problem state, okay, problem.

2160
02:26:01,060 --> 02:26:03,620
 So we know in symbolic AI we need to come up

2161
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:07,180
 with the symbols to represent the things.

2162
02:26:07,180 --> 02:26:10,780
 And then we know what are the legal states,

2163
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:12,500
 what are the legal movements,

2164
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:15,500
 we need to define the rules, okay.

2165
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:18,460
 And then come up with a state space.

2166
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:20,860
 Yeah, so those are the first few things.

2167
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:26,980
 For knowledge representation, yeah, overall in the AI

2168
02:26:26,980 --> 02:26:30,780
 can have a likely have a logic representation

2169
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:33,260
 or you can have a graph representation

2170
02:26:33,260 --> 02:26:35,020
 or neural network representation,

2171
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:37,180
 like the data driven stuff.

2172
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:42,020
 But for symbolic AI, we most use,

2173
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:44,420
 most popular one is using the graph,

2174
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:46,700
 okay, state space related.

2175
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:51,700
 Although previously was very much a pretty calculus, okay.

2176
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:57,500
 Yeah, and then we talk about the theoretical graph theory

2177
02:26:58,580 --> 02:27:01,180
 can support us problem solving.

2178
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:04,860
 Then we talk about that that's why we have to use a graph

2179
02:27:04,860 --> 02:27:06,980
 as a data structure.

2180
02:27:07,820 --> 02:27:09,420
 And then the terminology related to graph,

2181
02:27:09,420 --> 02:27:11,300
 I'm sure you understand that.

2182
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:13,699
 And then we show you the example,

2183
02:27:13,699 --> 02:27:15,340
 we show you the tic-tac-toe,

2184
02:27:15,340 --> 02:27:18,619
 we show you the eight puzzle, 15 puzzle,

2185
02:27:18,619 --> 02:27:22,220
 we show you the farmer moving around.

2186
02:27:22,220 --> 02:27:25,300
 Then we show we did exercise one,

2187
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:27,660
 which is a jar, water jar.

2188
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:32,220
 Okay, then we have a highlight of the strategy

2189
02:27:32,220 --> 02:27:35,380
 to go data driven or go driven.

2190
02:27:35,539 --> 02:27:36,779
 And then we had exercise two,

2191
02:27:36,779 --> 02:27:39,820
 which is practice on that, okay.

2192
02:27:39,820 --> 02:27:43,220
 I think we had quite a lot covered.

2193
02:27:44,259 --> 02:27:45,099
 Are you all right?

2194
02:27:46,619 --> 02:27:49,099
 Okay, yes, good.

2195
02:27:49,099 --> 02:27:53,740
 Okay, so go back and finish off the exercise two.

2196
02:27:53,740 --> 02:27:57,179
 We come back to check the answer next week.

2197
02:27:57,179 --> 02:28:01,699
 And then we continue discussion on the search algorithms.

2198
02:28:01,700 --> 02:28:06,140
 So we should be able to finish all the exhaustive search.

2199
02:28:06,140 --> 02:28:09,620
 And then we can start to introduce the heuristic search

2200
02:28:09,620 --> 02:28:12,380
 after that, the week after.

2201
02:28:12,380 --> 02:28:16,060
 And then we start to talk about data mining, okay.

2202
02:28:16,060 --> 02:28:18,580
 Okay, that's all for today.

2203
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:21,300
 Anything else, any quick question?

2204
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:25,460
 I got a question is talking about whether can form a team

2205
02:28:25,460 --> 02:28:29,460
 with another group people in tomorrow class.

2206
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:31,220
 Yes, the answer is yes.

2207
02:28:31,220 --> 02:28:33,699
 Okay, thank you.

2208
02:28:33,699 --> 02:28:34,859
 See you next week.

2209
02:28:34,859 --> 02:28:38,460
 Are you gonna expect this?

2210
02:28:40,460 --> 02:28:41,300
 Thanks.

2211
02:29:01,220 --> 02:29:02,060
