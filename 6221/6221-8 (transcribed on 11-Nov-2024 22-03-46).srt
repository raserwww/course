1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 you

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 you

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 you

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 you

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 you

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 you

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 you

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 you

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 you

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 you

11
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 you

12
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 you

13
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 you

14
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 you

15
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 you

16
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 you

17
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 you

18
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 you

19
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 you

20
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 you

21
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 you

22
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 you

23
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 you

24
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 you

25
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 you

26
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 you

27
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 you

28
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 you

29
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 you

30
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 you

31
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 okay, this assignment is more like a review or a survey. So you have the option to choose our topics that you are interested in. So here I list quite a few topics.

32
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 They are for different types of robots. So review the state of the art of one type of robots or autonomous systems.

33
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 So we have a lot of robots that can be used in hospitals, elderly care rooms, or in surgeries.

34
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 So we have manufacturing robots, many used in factories. Our logistics robots, many used in warehouses, or in the airport, the seaport, autonomous cars.

35
00:14:46,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 So let's say autonomous taxis. Airman aircraft vehicles, UAVs. So you can review small UAVs or even bigger UAVs, like flying taxis. So it's up to you.

36
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Cleaning robots for indoor usages or outdoor usages. These ones are fine.

37
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Robot manipulators or robot arms. They can be used in factories, in warehouses, and also in many other different environments.

38
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Robot grippers, they can also create robot hands. It's more like the anti-effector of robot manipulators.

39
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 This year, this humanoid robot is quite popular. So you can also review humanoid robots, robot dogs, or traditional mobile ground robots.

40
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 So you can also choose another type of robots. For each type of robots, the technical scope can be very broad. You don't have to cover everything.

41
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 You can choose something that you have interest to discuss in your assignment work.

42
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Let's say, for example, usually when people handle robots, people can consider sensing and perception, control, robot learning, many different topics.

43
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 So you can cover all of them, or just one of them. It's up to you to decide.

44
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 All right. So what needs to be covered in this assignment? So here we have five points.

45
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Number one, you review and compare the existing research and the development on this topic.

46
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 You can discuss research works, demos, user cases, products, and even projects in industry or in academia.

47
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 So through this kind of review and comparison, the purpose is to find out the best solution from your point of view.

48
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Let's say, for example, there are many different humanoid robots developing in USA, in Europe, in China, et cetera.

49
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 So they have different features. So comparing them, then you can share your opinion. Which one is the best from your point of view?

50
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Number two, so after you choose the best solution that you think, then you can describe that best solution and explain in some detail why you think it is the best.

51
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 This is the second point. And then the third point, discuss the challenges to improve the type of robots.

52
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 You don't have to figure it out by yourself. You can just find out from the literature.

53
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Next, what are the challenges already identified by researchers all around the world?

54
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Number four, discuss what you learned from this review.

55
00:18:49,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And then finally, comment on whether this review increases your interest to study further robotics or pursue a future career in robotics or intelligence systems.

56
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Robots or robotics is becoming more and more popular.

57
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 So this is an individual assignment. So each of you submit your work through NTU-LEN.

58
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 So after you log into NTU-LEN, you go to the folder assignment, then you can submit over there.

59
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Before the deadline, you can submit as many times as you can.

60
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 So we will agree based on your last submission.

61
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 But if possible, please remove the submissions that you don't want.

62
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Otherwise, there are too many files there and I may get confused.

63
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 If your student just meets a PDF, please don't use Word or any other format.

64
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 The deadline is 8th November. It's Friday.

65
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Please note that copying is not allowed in NTU.

66
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 So in this assignment, the same. So please don't copy from somewhere.

67
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 From sources even in a different language.

68
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Okay, so that's for the assignment.

69
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Next, if you have any questions regarding the assignment, you can talk to me during the break or after the class.

70
00:20:48,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Okay, so for today's class, because we don't have a lot of mathematics,

71
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 so I will just use a slides to teach this class.

72
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 In future, several weeks, we'll have mathematics.

73
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 I will write on the paper and show you the derivations.

74
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 They will make a kind of switch between the projector and also this camera system.

75
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Okay, this is the first lecture of part two, Introduction and Sensors.

76
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 All right, the same. We'll talk about sensors.

77
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 I'll first show you several samples from my lab.

78
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I will pass them through the class so you can take a look at them.

79
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 So first we'll have two camera sensors made by Intel.

80
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 They are called real-sense cameras.

81
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 So you can take a look at them and pass it to other students.

82
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Okay, so these are two UDB receivers for UDB sensors.

83
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Okay, I'll take a look at you and pass it to other students at the back.

84
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Okay, so these are two small sensors, some MUs.

85
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 We also have two laser range sensors.

86
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Some people call them LiDAR.

87
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Okay, so these are two MUs.

88
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 These are two MUs.

89
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 These are two MUs.

90
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 These are two MUs.

91
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 These are two MUs.

92
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Okay, this is the outline of today's class.

93
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Introduction and then we'll talk about different types of sensors.

94
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Sensor classification.

95
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 So next we'll talk about several features or characteristics of various sensors.

96
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Then we'll talk about multi-encoders,

97
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 heading orientation sensors, ground-based beacons,

98
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 also active range sensors and speed sensors, vision sensors, et cetera.

99
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 So in short, we will talk about multiple types of sensors.

100
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Robo sensors can mainly be put into two different classes,

101
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 internal state sensors and external state sensors.

102
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Internal sensors are used to measure the internal states of a machine,

103
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 for example, a robot or an autonomous vehicle.

104
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And those internal states include, like I say, position, orientation, speed, acceleration, et cetera.

105
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Why do we need internal states?

106
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Because we want to control the machines, we want to control the robots.

107
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 So for example, for robot arms, we want to control robot arms to do grasping,

108
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 to do manipulation, these kind of tasks.

109
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 External sensors are needed for the robot machine

110
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 to react and also interact with its environments or surroundings.

111
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Okay. Next, for example, if we want to use a robot to take care of an elderly people,

112
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 so there should be some kind of interaction between the robot and the human.

113
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 So how to make sure that this robot does not hate the human?

114
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 So how to make sure that they can pass some tools or objects between them?

115
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 So to do this, we need some external sensors, for example, cameras or ultrasonic sensors.

116
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 So here we have a list of sensors, sonar, infrared, haptic feedback sensors,

117
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 tactile sensors, range of motion sensors, vision sensors, et cetera.

118
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 So next, I'm going to show you several videos.

119
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Okay, so let me find the videos first, then I will switch back.

120
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Okay.

121
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Okay.

122
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Okay.

123
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Okay.

124
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Okay.

125
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Okay, so we are starting with this video on robotic dog.

126
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 So you guys can take a look first.

127
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 So when you are watching the video, you can think about what kind of sensors are used in this robot

128
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 and what can be the functions of the sensors.

129
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Okay.

130
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Okay.

131
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Okay.

132
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Okay.

133
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Okay.

134
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Okay.

135
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 This video is a very old one.

136
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 It was recorded about 16 years ago.

137
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 And why do I choose this one as a first video to show to you guys?

138
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Because from 2005 to 2008, there was a lot of development of autonomous robots,

139
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 especially this kind of robot dogs and also autonomous cars.

140
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 So these two topics were very popular in those several years.

141
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 So nowadays, we can buy much better robot dogs with a much cheaper price.

142
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 So and also nowadays, robotic dogs got a lot of applications in both CVN applications

143
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 and also military applications.

144
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 This video shows us the early stage development of robotic dogs.

145
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 So next, I'm also going to show you an early stage development of autonomous cars.

146
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Then we'll see how advanced the robots are nowadays.

147
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 This is an early version of Google car.

148
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Look, no hands.

149
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 No hands anywhere.

150
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 No hands.

151
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 No hands.

152
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 No hands.

153
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 No feet.

154
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 No nothing.

155
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 I love it.

156
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 So we're here at the stop sign.

157
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 The car's using the radars and laser to check and make sure there's nothing coming either way.

158
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 I'm going to fly myself.

159
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Old habits die hard, man.

160
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 They don't die.

161
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Hey, anybody up for a taco?

162
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Yeah, yeah.

163
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 What do you want to do today, Steve?

164
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 I'm all for tacos, myself.

165
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 All right, well, go get a taco at the drive-through.

166
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 And we're turning into the parking lot.

167
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 There we go.

168
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 There we go.

169
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Kind of creep along here.

170
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Does anybody have any money?

171
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 I've got money.

172
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 No, I've got my lawn right here.

173
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 You can roll down your window and order a burrito.

174
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 Yeah, push that.

175
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 I'm doing very well.

176
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 How are you today?

177
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 I'm doing great today.

178
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 This is some of the best driving I've ever done.

179
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 95% of my vision is gone.

180
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 I'm well past my own blind.

181
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 You lose your timing in life.

182
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Everything takes you much longer.

183
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 There are some places that you cannot go.

184
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 There are some things that you really cannot do.

185
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 Where this would change my life is to give me the independence

186
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 and the flexibility to go the places I both want to go

187
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 and need to go.

188
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Well, I need to do those things.

189
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 To do those things.

190
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Okay, so this is an earlier version of Autonomous Cars.

191
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 So now this we can find many different types of Autonomous Cars.

192
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Just want to share with you that tomorrow,

193
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 actually tomorrow Tesla is going to really

194
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 launch its robot taxi.

195
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 So let's see how good it is.

196
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 A couple of months ago,

197
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 in a city in China,

198
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 there was deployment of many autonomous taxis.

199
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 I think it's in Wuhan, China.

200
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 They call it a robot.

201
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 It's how they call it the autonomous taxi.

202
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 It's actually not fully autonomous.

203
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 It's more like semi-autonomous.

204
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 So for most of the time, the taxis run by themselves.

205
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 But under very harsh environments,

206
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 or under very complicated environments,

207
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 human drivers take over remotely.

208
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 So I will call it like a semi-autonomous.

209
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Okay, so since last year,

210
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 these humanoid robots become very popular.

211
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 So you can find many different types of humanoid robots online.

212
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 So here I just list three of them.

213
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 And these pictures were found about more than, I would say,

214
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 more than three or four months ago.

215
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 So they are not the latest version.

216
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 The first robot is called Atlas,

217
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 made by Boston Dynamics.

218
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 The second one is called Optimus,

219
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 made by Tesla.

220
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 So for this one, people may be able to buy in 2025.

221
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 The third one is called a figure.

222
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 So this version is called a figure 01.

223
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 So there may be a newer version released already.

224
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 So this is made by the company figure and also OpenAI.

225
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 So this one has potential to become quite intelligent.

226
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 I'm not afraid to show my bare skin.

227
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 Ever since I started using Fatera essence,

228
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 my skin feels more radiant, smooth, and deeply hydrated.

229
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 So I have to wait until this finishes the way.

230
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 I'm confident in my best bare skin.

231
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 If I can, you can too.

232
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 Boston Dynamics, the company behind the famous Atlas humanoid robot,

233
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 has just released a new video showing Atlas picking

234
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 and placing automotive struts in a warehouse.

235
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 This is a remarkable demonstration of Atlas's abilities

236
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 and a challenge to other humanoid robots in the market.

237
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 Let's take a look at the video

238
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 and see what it means for the future of robotics.

239
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Atlas is able to perform all of the object recognition

240
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 using its onboard sensors.

241
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 It can locate the automotive struts in a vertical storage unit,

242
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 grasp them with its grippers,

243
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 and place them horizontally onto a flow cart.

244
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 It can also avoid obstacles and balance itself

245
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 while carrying heavy loads.

246
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 This is not an easy task for a humanoid robot,

247
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 as it requires a lot of coordination, precision, and stability.

248
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 But why did Boston Dynamics decide to show this video now?

249
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 Well, I think it has something to do with the competition

250
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 in the humanoid robot market.

251
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 As you may know, there are many other companies

252
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 that are developing humanoid robots for various applications,

253
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 such as logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and entertainment.

254
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Some of the most notable ones are Agility Robotics,

255
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 Aptronic, Figure, and Softbank Robotics.

256
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 These companies have been releasing videos of their robots

257
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 as they evolve and become more capable.

258
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 For example, Agility's Digit is being tested by Amazon

259
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 and GXO Logistics for delivering packages and sorting boxes.

260
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 Figure recently signed a deal with BMW

261
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 to explore what humanids can do

262
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 at the automakers manufacturing facility in South Carolina.

263
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 And Softbank's Pepper is a popular service robot

264
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 that can interact with customers and read emotions.

265
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 So, how does Atlas compare to these other humanids?

266
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Well, Atlas has some advantages and disadvantages.

267
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 On the one hand, Atlas is one of the most advanced

268
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 and agile humanoid robots in the world.

269
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 It can perform dynamic parkour feats, such as jumping, flipping, and running.

270
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 It can also work in challenging environments,

271
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 such as a mock construction site.

272
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 It has a high degree of autonomy and intelligence,

273
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 thanks to its AI and machine learning technologies.

274
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 On the other hand, Atlas is still a development platform

275
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 and not a commercial product.

276
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 It is not ready to go to work in the real world just yet.

277
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 One of the reasons is that Atlas uses hydraulic actuators,

278
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 which are powerful but noisy, bulky, and expensive.

279
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 Hydraulic actuators also require a lot of maintenance and cooling,

280
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 which limits the robot's battery life and mobility.

281
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 Atlas also lacks some of the human-like features and social skills

282
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 that other humanids have, such as facial expressions, speech,

283
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 and emotion recognition.

284
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 So, what does this mean for the future of Atlas and humanoid robots in general?

285
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 Well, I think that Boston Dynamics is trying to show that Atlas is still a leader in the field,

286
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 and that it can perform tasks that other humanids cannot.

287
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 However, I also think that Boston Dynamics will have to adapt to the changing market and customer needs.

288
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 They will have to find a way to make Atlas more affordable, efficient, and user-friendly.

289
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 They will also have to collaborate with other companies and industries

290
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 to find the best use cases for Atlas.

291
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 And they will have to keep innovating and improving Atlas's capabilities and performance.

292
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 Click here to watch my latest video on the Aptira Electric Solar Car,

293
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 which is said to be the world's most efficient electric car.

294
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 It has a design that resembles that of an aeroplane and is said to be mass-produced, beginning this year.

295
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 It's a big deal and feels like a big deal, exclusively for Prime members.

296
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 Okay, so just now for this version that you saw,

297
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 I think Boston Dynamics already discontinued this version,

298
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 because this is driven by a hydraulic actuator, so that it looks quite big.

299
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 The new version uses motors as actuators.

300
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 So for the new version, you can find it in YouTube and watch it yourself.

301
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 The second one is Optimus, made by Tesla. Let's take a look.

302
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 Let's take a look.

303
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 Okay, so next we'll talk about internal state sensors.

304
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 There are many two different categories, internal and external.

305
00:46:49,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 For internal state sensors, they consist of devices used to measure position.

306
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 Velocity, or acceleration of robot joints, and all the anti-effectors.

307
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 So this is the meaning for robot arms.

308
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 Let's see, for the other type of robots, for example, flying UAVs,

309
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 so the measurements can be different.

310
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 So here we have several examples of internal sensors.

311
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 Potential meters, they measure voltages or electrical potentials.

312
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 Encoders, so they are motion sensing devices.

313
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 There are many different types of encoders, such as optical encoders.

314
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 These kind of sensors are usually very cheap, but the accuracy may not be good.

315
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 Tecometers, they measure the rotation speed of a shaft or disk.

316
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 If we want to have good control of robots, we need to have very accurate measurements of the internal states.

317
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 So these kind of sensors are necessary to have good control of robots.

318
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 When people measure internal states, they mainly measure position, velocity and acceleration.

319
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 For these internal sensors, they should be accurate.

320
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 They also should be not expensive or cost-effective.

321
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 This is because for one robot, quite often we need to use a lot of internal sensors.

322
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 For example, for one robotic arm, which you started in part one of the class,

323
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 there can be many different joints, like six joints, seven joints.

324
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 So you need sensors for each joint.

325
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 This will increase the number of sensors required for robots.

326
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 When we consider sensors for robots, what are the factors we should take into consideration?

327
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 Here we have listed five factors.

328
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 The first one is the budget and overall sensor cost.

329
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 Let's say if you make a humanoid robot, you can use expensive sensors because the budget is usually quite big.

330
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 But if you are just making a toy, like a toy robot, the sensor should be very cheap.

331
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 Number two, power needs for a particular joint.

332
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 For UAVs, quite often the flying cannot last very long, like 20-30 minutes.

333
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 This is because the UAVs cannot carry very heavy batteries.

334
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 So for robots, no matter if UAVs or ground robots or robot arms,

335
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 we should consider the power consumption.

336
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 Number three, maximum permissible size of the actuator.

337
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 So just now when we watched a video on this humanoid robot,

338
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 Aipylus made by Boston Dynamics, we noticed that hydraulic actuators were used in that robot.

339
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 That actuator is actually quite big.

340
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 For sensors, we should also consider the sizes.

341
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 Next, for small UAVs, we cannot use very big cameras.

342
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 We should use very small cameras.

343
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 Number four, sensor resolution, because this will decide the accuracy of the measurements.

344
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 Usually the higher the resolution, the more expensive the sensor is.

345
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 Number five, the need to monitor directly the actions of the joint.

346
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 The second class of sensors is called external data sensors.

347
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 So they are used for the robots to sense the environment and also to interact with the environment.

348
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 For external sensors, we should also consider the factors that we just mentioned,

349
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 such as size, energy consumption, accuracy, resolution, these kind of factors.

350
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 Based on the functions or usages of external data sensors, we can list their main functions here.

351
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 Vision, touch, hearing, movement.

352
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 So these are similar to functions that human has.

353
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 Vision sensors mean referred to cameras, normal cameras and infrared cameras.

354
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 So humans will have eyes, which serve as vision sensors.

355
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 These sensors help robots to identify the surrounding environment and take appropriate actions.

356
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 In robots, ground robots, robot arms, UAVs and also autonomous cars,

357
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 vision sensors, cameras are very widely used.

358
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:04,000
 Number two, touch or contact.

359
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 So touch sensors enable robots to interpret human emotions, human forces,

360
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 for human-robots collaboration or human-robots interaction.

361
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:30,000
 Robots use touch signals to map the profile of a surface in hostile environments, such as a water path.

362
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:37,000
 This touch sensor is not a very hot research topic.

363
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 It's not just about applications.

364
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:49,000
 Actually, many researchers are developing new touch sensors.

365
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
 Hearing.

366
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 These kind of sensors are not that commonly used in robots in comparison to vision sensors and touch sensors.

367
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 But they can still be useful for robots, especially for robots that need to interact with humans.

368
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 Number four, movement.

369
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:31,000
 So it provides a guiding system for an automated robot to determine the ideal path to perform its task.

370
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 So here are several examples of these several types of sensors.

371
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
 For vision sensors, we mainly have cameras.

372
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:57,000
 Here we mean normal cameras or infrared cameras that do not need light to work.

373
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 Laser range sensors, RFID sensors.

374
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:09,000
 When people talk about vision sensors, they mean referred to cameras and infrared sensors.

375
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:22,000
 Vision sensors can be used for object recognition or land market recognition, 3D, thin recovery, thin understanding, etc.

376
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 Many different tasks.

377
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:41,000
 So vision sensors, I would say, are the most commonly used sensors in robotics and autonomous vehicles.

378
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 Touch-touch sensors, range of finders, GPS, and dormitory.

379
00:56:48,000 --> 00:57:00,000
 So these are several other examples.

380
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:08,000
 For range of finders, so here we mainly, in this class,

381
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
 we will mainly cover lasers and ultrasonic sensors.

382
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
 They cannot just be used for obstacle avoidance.

383
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:26,000
 They can also be used in localization and navigation, these kind of tasks.

384
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 GPS, global positioning system.

385
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 So in the past, GPS refers to the solution developed by the United States.

386
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 Nowadays, there are quite a few solutions developed by USA, by China, by Russia, by European Union.

387
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
 So there are multiple solutions.

388
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:02,000
 And also, in recent years, Tesla developed this star link.

389
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:13,000
 So this is actually a solution that has very good commercial applications.

390
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 So in the future, people may use this new solution in navigation and localization.

391
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:37,000
 So this can be done using encoders, gyroscopes, etc.

392
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
 Okay, so next we're going to take a break.

393
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
 So about 15 minutes, then we'll continue.

394
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,000
 Thank you.

395
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 Thank you.

396
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
 Thank you.

397
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,000
 Thank you.

398
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
 Thank you.

399
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
 Thank you.

400
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
 Thank you.

401
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
 Thank you.

402
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
 Thank you.

403
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
 Thank you.

404
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
 Thank you.

405
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
 Thank you.

406
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
 Thank you.

407
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,000
 Thank you.

408
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
 Thank you.

409
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
 Thank you.

410
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,000
 Thank you.

411
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:17,000
 Thank you.

412
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
 Thank you.

413
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
 Thank you.

414
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:32,000
 Thank you.

415
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
 Thank you.

416
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
 Okay, let's continue the class.

417
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:52,000
 In week four, we'll talk about common filtering and also multi-sensor fusion.

418
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
 So why do we want to use multiple sensors?

419
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:04,000
 Because it provides some benefits.

420
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,000
 We can summarize the benefits here.

421
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:19,000
 Redendency, complete metarity, timeliness, and cost.

422
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,000
 Other than this, there's also improved reliability, etc.

423
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:35,000
 For usage of multiple sensors.

424
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
 Next, we'll talk about these benefits one by one.

425
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:45,000
 Number one, redundant information.

426
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
 Next, if you have just one sensor.

427
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
 So this sensor may have...

428
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
 There may be something that this sensor cannot measure.

429
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
 And if something goes wrong with this sensor,

430
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
 then we don't have any measurement.

431
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
 So if you have multiple sensors,

432
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,000
 if one of them fails, we still have some measurements.

433
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:19,000
 Number two, we can take measurements from different perspectives.

434
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
 If we have multiple sensors.

435
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:32,000
 The second point is that the integration or fusion of redundant information

436
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,000
 can reduce overall uncertainty.

437
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
 Multiple sensors can also increase reliability

438
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:51,000
 in case of sensor error or failure.

439
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
 Complimentary information.

440
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
 So if you have multiple sensors,

441
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:03,000
 they allow features in the environment to be perceived.

442
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:14,000
 They are not impossible to perceive using just an individual sensor.

443
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
 More timely information measurement.

444
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
 So if you have multiple sensors,

445
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:31,000
 you can actually have parallel measurements.

446
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
 Okay.

447
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
 This one is about cost.

448
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
 So when people use multiple sensors,

449
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:47,000
 it is possible to even lower down the cost.

450
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:54,000
 So if we use just one sensor to achieve accuracy and high reliability,

451
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
 the sensors usually are of very good quality.

452
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:03,000
 And quite often, also quite expensive.

453
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
 If we use multiple sensors or more than one sensor,

454
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:26,000
 we can use those sensors that may have lower accuracy and lower cost.

455
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
 For this multi-sensor fusion techniques,

456
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
 we will talk about it in week 4.

457
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:40,000
 We will cover the mathematics to do multi-sensor fusion and estimation.

458
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:48,000
 So just now we will talk about the internal state sensors and external state sensors.

459
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:56,000
 This is another way of classifying sensors.

460
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
 They are based on functions.

461
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:06,000
 The first step is called perceptive sensors.

462
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:14,000
 These sensors measure the internal state of the system,

463
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
 the robot or the machine.

464
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:26,000
 So for example, angular position of motors.

465
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:34,000
 Examples for this type of sensors include GPS, INS,

466
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:45,000
 initial acting system, encoders, compass, etc.

467
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:51,000
 The second type is called extraceptive sensors.

468
01:18:51,000 --> 01:19:00,000
 So they determine the measurements of objects relative to a robot's frame of reference.

469
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
 So usually when we control, when we handle a robot,

470
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:15,000
 we need to define a frame of reference so that we can find the coordinates of the robot itself

471
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:22,000
 and also the objects around the robot.

472
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:30,000
 These sensors can measure distance from the robot to another object

473
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:37,000
 so that we can do collision avoidance, also avoidance, etc.

474
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:46,000
 They can keep a robot from colliding with other robots or other objects.

475
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:56,000
 Contact sensors, range sensors, vision sensors fall into this category.

476
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:03,000
 The third type is extra perceptive sensors.

477
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:14,000
 So there are many directional sensors.

478
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:26,000
 Based on where energy comes from, we can have active sensors and passive sensors.

479
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:33,000
 Active sensors emit their own energy and measure the reaction.

480
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:41,000
 So usually they have better performance, but they have some influence on the environment

481
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
 and generally consumes more energy.

482
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:53,000
 So here we have several examples, laser, ortho-sonic, and IR sensors.

483
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:04,000
 Those radars, especially those used for military applications, they may consume a lot of energy.

484
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,000
 You even need to have a power plant to provide energy to those radars

485
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
 because they are active sensors.

486
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:20,000
 They need to emit a lot of energy and to measure the reaction.

487
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:31,000
 Passive sensors receive energy already in the environment, so they consume less energy

488
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
 but they have some signal and noise problems.

489
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
 So for example, cameras are passive sensors.

490
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:50,000
 Camera sensors just measure the illumination in the environment.

491
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
 So here we have a table.

492
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,000
 In this table we will see several types of sensors.

493
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:04,000
 We start with tactile sensors or contact sensors.

494
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:12,000
 They are used for detection of physical contact or closeness.

495
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
 So these are several examples.

496
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:26,000
 Contact switches, bumpers, optical barriers, and non-contact proximity sensors.

497
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,000
 They are usually external sensors, you see.

498
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,000
 They can be passive or active.

499
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,000
 The second type, wheel motor sensors.

500
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:49,000
 They can measure the speed and the position of the motors or wheels.

501
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,000
 They are mostly encoders.

502
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
 As I mentioned earlier, there are many types of encoders.

503
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:06,000
 They are usually quite cheap but not accurate.

504
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
 Optical encoders are quite commonly used.

505
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:16,000
 There are also some other encoders.

506
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
 Encoders are internal sensors.

507
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
 They can be passive or they can be active.

508
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,000
 Most of them are active.

509
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:36,000
 Heading sensors measure orientation or angles of the robot

510
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
 in relation to a fixed reference frame.

511
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
 Here are three examples.

512
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
 Campers, which we know very well.

513
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:54,000
 Geryscopes, including the meters.

514
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:03,000
 They can be either passive or active, either internal or external.

515
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:12,000
 Ground-based beacons are usually used for localization.

516
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
 GPS is an example for these types of sensors.

517
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,000
 They are external and they are active sensors.

518
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
 Active ranging.

519
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
 For example, laser range finder, orthosonic sensor.

520
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
 They fall into this category.

521
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
 They are external and also active.

522
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:40,000
 Laser and orthosonic sensors are very commonly used in robots.

523
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
 As for the sensors I showed to the class,

524
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
 we have two laser range finders.

525
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
 They are called Hokuyo.

526
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,000
 These are range finders.

527
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:05,000
 Motion speed sensors.

528
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:13,000
 They measure speed relative to fixed or moving objects.

529
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,000
 These kinds of sensors are commonly used in robotics.

530
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
 Doppler radar, Doppler sound.

531
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
 They are external sensors and active sensors.

532
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
 Vision-based sensors or vision sensors.

533
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:36,000
 These sensors are also very commonly used in robotics.

534
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:42,000
 For cameras, there are many two different sensing technologies.

535
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,000
 CCD, CMOS.

536
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:54,000
 They are for external measurements and their passive sensors.

537
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
 For this first class, we want to talk about some concepts

538
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
 and also introductory stuff.

539
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
 We will not have the details.

540
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:11,000
 We will not talk about the mathematics for the sensors.

541
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,000
 When we choose sensors for certain tasks,

542
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:23,000
 these are the factors that we can consider.

543
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:30,000
 Sensors size, how big it is, it depends on our application environment

544
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,000
 and also the size of the robot.

545
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:43,000
 For UAVs, for flying vehicles, weight is quite important.

546
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:51,000
 Power consumption, voltage interface.

547
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:57,000
 We have to consider the voltages of the batteries

548
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
 and also the motors, actuators.

549
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
 Field of view.

550
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:18,000
 This is about in what range of angles the sensor can sense objects.

551
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,000
 For cameras and laser-reviewed finders,

552
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:29,000
 field of view is a very important feature.

553
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,000
 Range. You all know range. How far?

554
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,000
 It has low and upper limits.

555
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:47,000
 Dynamic range, for example, camera pixels.

556
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
 Resolution.

557
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
 It is about the smallest input change that can be detected.

558
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:05,000
 For cameras, we have 1 million pixels, 2 million pixels.

559
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,000
 This kind of method to measure the resolution.

560
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:17,000
 Inevitability. This is a good property desirable for all the sensors.

561
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:29,000
 We want the measurements to be proportional to the actual values.

562
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:39,000
 His research is about the past dependency for sensors.

563
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,000
 When we increase the measurements and decrease the measurements,

564
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
 they can be two different paths.

565
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:52,000
 This can be modeled by these hysteresis.

566
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:59,000
 Bander waves of frequency, sensitivity, and cross sensitivity.

567
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:06,000
 These are also features for some sensors.

568
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
 When we choose sensors, this is probably the most important thing.

569
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
 Accuracy.

570
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
 What kind of accuracy do we need for the sensor?

571
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:35,000
 This depends on the requirement of the application and also the budget.

572
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
 Let me show you one example.

573
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
 For this M use, it can be quite cheap.

574
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:49,000
 It costs 50,000 US dollars.

575
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
 The difference can be huge.

576
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:59,000
 If you want higher accuracy, then the cost will be much higher.

577
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
 Precision.

578
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
 These two concepts can be confusing.

579
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
 Sometimes people think that they are the same thing.

580
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
 Actually, they are different.

581
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,000
 Accuracy is about the difference from the real value.

582
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:22,000
 If the real value is 1 meter, and if the measurement is 0.8 meter,

583
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,000
 the area is about 0.2 meter, so this is about accuracy.

584
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
 Precision is more about repeatability.

585
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:40,000
 If you use one sensor, the real value is 1 meter.

586
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,000
 For the measurements that you have, it is very close to 1 meter.

587
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:52,000
 0.99, 0.98, 1.01, always like that.

588
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:59,000
 This has quite good repeatability or precision.

589
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
 The measurements are very different.

590
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:09,000
 Sometimes 1.5 meters, sometimes 1.1 meters, sometimes 0.8 meters.

591
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,000
 The precision is not good.

592
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:19,000
 The measurements are quite different.

593
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:38,000
 For errors, we can have deterministic errors,

594
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
 and we can also have random errors.

595
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:48,000
 For deterministic errors, we can do something to make corrections,

596
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:56,000
 even if we know how this error is caused.

597
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:03,000
 For random errors, it is quite hard to predict.

598
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:13,000
 Have to do some algorithms to take care of them.

599
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:21,000
 Next, we will go through several types of sensors.

600
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:28,000
 For these sensors, you do not have to remember the working principle of the sensors.

601
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:43,000
 In this class, you just need to know what the sensor can achieve, what it can do.

602
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:48,000
 Wheel motor encoders.

603
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:54,000
 Just now, in one of the tables, we noticed that there are about 10 types,

604
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,000
 or even more than 10 types of encoders.

605
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:10,000
 They measure the position or speed of the wheels or the steering.

606
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:19,000
 Usually, for these ground robots, encoders can be installed in the wheels.

607
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:26,000
 They integrate wheel movements to get an estimate of the position.

608
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
 We call this process odometry.

609
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
 You can use encoders to do odometry.

610
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
 This is usually a low-cost solution.

611
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
 You can also use cameras to do odometry.

612
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:46,000
 People can call it, like, visu odometry.

613
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:52,000
 It is a different method.

614
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
 Optical encoders are very commonly used.

615
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:06,000
 They are proprioceptive sensors and measure the position.

616
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:15,000
 They are in a fixed frame of reference.

617
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:21,000
 For encoders, the typical resolutions are like this.

618
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:27,000
 This was information that gave in some time ago.

619
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
 If you want to buy encoders for your project,

620
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:43,000
 you should check the nature of the products and see what are the resolutions provided.

621
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:51,000
 The second type of sensors is magnetic compass.

622
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:57,000
 These kind of sensors are usually not very accurate.

623
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,000
 They use magnetic fields on earth.

624
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:12,000
 There is a lot of noise that can affect the accuracy of these kinds of sensors.

625
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:17,000
 Here we have three major drawbacks for these types of sensors.

626
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
 Number one is the weakness of the earth's magnetic field.

627
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:31,000
 Number two is that it can be disturbed by magnetic objects or other sources.

628
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:40,000
 Number three is not working in indoor environments.

629
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,000
 This doesn't mean that they are not useful.

630
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
 Let me show you one example.

631
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:52,000
 Nowadays, this vision-based localization is very popular.

632
01:35:52,000 --> 01:36:02,000
 People use cameras to do localization for robots and ground vehicles.

633
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:16,000
 One drawback for this kind of vision-based localization is that if the lighting condition is very bad,

634
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
 it is very dark in the environment.

635
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
 It is very bright in the environment.

636
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,000
 Cameras don't work very well.

637
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,000
 People need to find alternative solutions.

638
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:42,000
 This can be an alternative solution if cameras don't work well in certain environments.

639
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
 Often people don't use just one type of sensors.

640
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:57,000
 For robots, people may use multiple sensors at the same time, including cameras, laser-ray definitors,

641
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:05,000
 M-U's, and even this campus sensor in outdoor environments.

642
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:16,000
 By using them, we can have a more reliable and more accurate solution.

643
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
 General scopes.

644
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:27,000
 This kind of sensor measures changes in vehicle-wide robot orientation

645
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:40,000
 by taking advantage of physical loss that produce predictable effects under rotation.

646
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:48,000
 General scopes can be used in robots.

647
01:37:48,000 --> 01:38:01,000
 The expensive ones are used in military areas, for example, in missiles.

648
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:09,000
 There are three functional principles for general scopes, mechanical, optical,

649
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:16,000
 and these micro-electromechanical systems based, MEMS based.

650
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:26,000
 Initially, people use mechanical general scopes, and nowadays these MEMS based general scopes are quite commonly used

651
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:33,000
 because of the good performance and also lower cost.

652
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:38,000
 Good general scopes can be quite expensive.

653
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:43,000
 There are two categories.

654
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:52,000
 Orientation. This kind of sensors direct-measure de-orientation angles.

655
01:38:52,000 --> 01:39:04,000
 Rate geros. They don't measure orientation or angular positions.

656
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:11,000
 Instead, they measure angular velocity or rotation velocity.

657
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:17,000
 Then we do integration of velocity to get position.

658
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
 For general scopes, there is one drawback.

659
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:33,000
 The error drift. Initially, you can have very accurate measurements, but after a while, it becomes less accurate.

660
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:40,000
 If this happens, we need to have a correction to the measurements.

661
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:50,000
 Usually, we use another sensor to do the correction.

662
01:39:50,000 --> 01:40:10,000
 Accelerometers. An accelerometer is a device that measures the proper acceleration of the device with a robot or a vehicle.

663
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:27,000
 Similar to geros scopes, these MEMS based accelerometers are commonly used as solutions.

664
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:37,000
 This can be a little bit boring because we're just talking about this kind of concept.

665
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:44,000
 In the class, I'll talk about the main points of these sensors.

666
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
 How can you do something from these concepts?

667
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:56,000
 For each sensor, you just pay attention to the function of the sensor.

668
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:01,000
 What kind of measurements can this sensor provide?

669
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:16,000
 In the future, if you get a real project, you will know what are your options, what kind of sensors you may be able to choose.

670
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:31,000
 Then you get the details of the sensors and you compare their accuracy, resolution, cost, power consumption, size, etc.

671
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:38,000
 Then pick the correct sensors for your project.

672
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:47,000
 Inertial measurement units or inertial navigation system, M use or N as.

673
01:41:47,000 --> 01:42:16,000
 This kind of sensor refers to a device that utilizes sensors or sensing components such as geros scopes and accelerometers to estimate the relative position, velocity, and acceleration of a vehicle or robot in the process.

674
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:33,000
 This is a complete M and UIS maintains 6 degrees of freedom estimate of the vehicle pose.

675
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:47,000
 The 6 DLF, 3 of them are for position and another 3 are for angles or orientation.

676
01:42:47,000 --> 01:43:02,000
 For airplanes, we call them raw pitch-row. The position is x, y, z, 3-dimensional.

677
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:18,000
 This block diagram shows how we can get a position from geros scopes and accelerometers.

678
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:28,000
 From geros scopes, we start with rich geros. We don't use those geros that provide a position directly.

679
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:47,000
 From rich geros, we can have orientation. From accelerometers, we can figure out the acceleration.

680
01:43:47,000 --> 01:44:02,000
 Then we do integration. We can have velocity. Then we integrate again. We can have position.

681
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:14,000
 M use and N as are very sensitive to measurement errors.

682
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:28,000
 This is quite similar to this error drift. Quite often, we should also have another extra sensor that can provide correction from time to time.

683
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:38,000
 Here we have a website. Through this link, you can find a list of M U and S products.

684
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:53,000
 M use can be under control. That is, even if you want to buy, you cannot buy them because they can be used in military applications.

685
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:59,000
 For cheaper ones, there should be no problem. You can buy whatever you want.

686
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:09,000
 For those good ones, you cannot get what you want.

687
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:19,000
 B can be based on positioning systems. For this kind of system, we need to deploy several B cans first.

688
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:29,000
 B cans are signaling devices with a precisely low position.

689
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:43,000
 Basically, based on low positions, we take multiple measurements and we decide the position of the robot or the vehicle.

690
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:56,000
 B can be based on navigation and localization is used since humans started to travel.

691
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:09,000
 There can be natural beacons such as stars and there can be artificial beacons like houses.

692
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:17,000
 GPS global positioning system is a beacon-based navigation technology.

693
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:24,000
 It was first invented in the United States for military applications.

694
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:43,000
 In the NITO-AN, it was provided for civilian applications, for navigation to the vehicles, cars, trucks, etc.

695
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:51,000
 GPS is an outdoor solution for localization.

696
01:46:51,000 --> 01:47:02,000
 For indoor environments, if we want to localize or navigate our robots, we should use other solutions.

697
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:15,000
 For example, SLAM. This is a very popular or very commonly used solution for indoor navigation and localization.

698
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:31,000
 The major drawback with the use of beacon-based solutions is that this kind of solution has limited flexibility and adaptability to changing environments.

699
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:50,000
 Because when there is change, you have to change the beacon. This can be quite troublesome and sometimes even costly.

700
01:47:50,000 --> 01:48:05,000
 Active ultrasonic beacons. This means the beacons are based on ultrasonic technologies.

701
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:18,000
 The robots must load the emitter locations. For example, here we have two emitters, so we have to load their locations.

702
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:30,000
 This solution uses time-over-flight TOF to find out the position of the robot.

703
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:40,000
 Before we calculate the position of the robot, we should first achieve time synchronization.

704
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:58,000
 Some details for this GPS system, Global Positioning System.

705
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:07,000
 Here are several facts. First, it was developed for military use by the United States.

706
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
 It is called Navistar.

707
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:25,000
 Initially, there were 24 satellites for that GPS system.

708
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:37,000
 Nowadays, for many countries, they launch a lot of satellites to provide GPS positioning services.

709
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:51,000
 To have positioning using satellites, we need at least four satellites.

710
01:49:51,000 --> 01:50:01,000
 You may wonder why not three? Because based on geometry, if you have three satellites, we can decide the position.

711
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:07,000
 Think about why we need four satellites.

712
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:25,000
 There are some technical challenges for this GPS system, but nowadays, most of them have been very well solved.

713
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
 For the GPS system, we need at least four satellites.

714
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:38,000
 This is because we first need to achieve time synchronization, and then we can find out the position of an object.

715
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:46,000
 That's why we need four different satellites.

716
01:50:46,000 --> 01:51:08,000
 To have range sensors, these kind of sensors can be used for obstacle avoidance, collision avoidance, localization, and environment modeling.

717
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:24,000
 Autosonic sensors as well as laser range sensors make use of speed of sound or electromagnetic waves.

718
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:29,000
 The distance is speed times time off flight.

719
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:37,000
 These kind of sensors measure the time off flight and then derive distance.

720
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:42,000
 That's the working principle for time off flight range sensors.

721
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:55,000
 These kind of sensors are very commonly used in robots and autonomous vehicles.

722
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:14,000
 If you have an interest in autonomous vehicles and if you do some study on their sensors, you may notice that almost all of them use time off flight sensors, except for Tesla.

723
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:34,000
 Tesla tried to remove all the ultrasonic sensors and use cameras only. I think that's a very ambitious goal.

724
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:50,000
 For our robotics projects, we usually use laser range sensors and all ultrasonic sensors.

725
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:59,000
 The quality of time off flight range sensors depends on the following six factors.

726
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:07,000
 Number one, uncertainties about the exact time of arrival of the reflected signal.

727
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:15,000
 And number two, inaccuracies in the time off flight measurement.

728
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:29,000
 For the other factors, they are the speed of the mobile robot or the target and the variation of propagation speed, for example, sound.

729
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:36,000
 For applications in this kind of normal environments, this may not be that critical.

730
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:45,000
 But for underwater applications, this is very important.

731
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:50,000
 In the action ways, target, for example, the surface.

732
01:53:50,000 --> 01:54:00,000
 Similarly, for underwater applications, this is quite critical.

733
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:08,000
 Opening angle of the transmitted beam also matters.

734
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:20,000
 Ultrasonic sensors transmit a packet of ultrasonic pressure waves.

735
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:31,000
 The typical frequency is from 40 Hz to 180 kHz.

736
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:39,000
 And the opening angle is usually around 20 to 70 degrees.

737
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:53,000
 This kind of sensor is usually quite cheap for robots in the labs or for normal usage.

738
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:58,000
 But underwater usage, so they can be quite expensive.

739
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
 Laser range finders.

740
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:07,000
 So just now you actually saw two of them.

741
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:11,000
 So these are kind of Hokuyo laser range finders.

742
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:16,000
 They came with a lot of applications for laser range finders.

743
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
 And also very easy to use.

744
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:26,000
 Five years ago, it can be quite difficult to use a laser range finder.

745
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:30,000
 But now this is because of ROS, ROS1, ROS2.

746
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:39,000
 So you can config usage of laser range finders very easily in the ROS environment.

747
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:46,000
 And also there are many different APIs for you to use.

748
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:55,000
 Laser range finders are also known as laser radar or LIDAR.

749
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
 LIDAR detection and ranging.

750
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
 So there are two laser range finders.

751
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:12,000
 There also are 3D LIDAR, which can be used in autonomous cars.

752
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
 They transmit and receive beams.

753
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:20,000
 The transmitted and received beams are coaxial.

754
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:30,000
 The transmitter illuminates a target with a collimated beam or laser.

755
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:36,000
 The receiver detects the time needed for round trip.

756
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:44,000
 This is one kind of time of flight sensor.

757
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,000
 There are many two different types of laser range finders.

758
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:58,000
 So maybe like 10 years ago, this sick laser range finder was very commonly used.

759
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:08,000
 And nowadays, this kind of lasers, for example, Hokuyo, it's quite commonly used.

760
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:17,000
 The time of flight measurement is generally achieved using one of the following two measures.

761
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:23,000
 First laser or face shift measurement.

762
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:30,000
 So in this class, we just use laser range finders.

763
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:39,000
 And just for your information, in triple E, we have many professors working on laser technologies.

764
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:55,000
 So they work on different laser solutions and also photonics, meaning in physics.

765
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:06,000
 First part of the laser, for example, SSCK laser, made in Germany.

766
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:14,000
 This kind of sensor uses direct measurements of time of flight.

767
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:22,000
 And it requires resolving picoseconds.

768
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:31,000
 For the second type of laser sensors, face shift measurement based laser sensors.

769
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:48,000
 Sensor transmits wide-percent amplitude of modulated light at a low frequency and measures the face shift between the transmitted and reflected signals.

770
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:54,000
 Technically, the second method is easier than the first method.

771
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:58,000
 So this kind of sensors becomes quite popular.

772
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:08,000
 And also the cost has also been reduced a lot.

773
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:14,000
 All right, so this is the topic that we just covered in this week one.

774
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:21,000
 Sensor classification, sensor features, or sensor characterization.

775
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:35,000
 Specifically, we mentioned briefly motion encoders, heading orientation sensors, ground based beacons, active ranging, speed sensors, and vision sensors, et cetera.

776
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:45,000
 So in the future, we will focus mainly on the vision sensors, cameras.

777
01:59:45,000 --> 02:00:01,000
 So in robotics, the two commonly used sensors are cameras and the laser range finders.

778
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:15,000
 In week two, we will talk about, like the camera calibration, like the multi-view geometry for cameras.

779
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:22,000
 In week three, we'll talk about the structure from motion for cameras.

780
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:31,000
 How can we figure out, how can we do structure and pose estimation using multi-view geometry?

781
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:41,000
 So what are homographies, these kind of concepts, and what are the algorithms to find the homographies?

782
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,000
 So this will be covered in week three.

783
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:50,000
 And in week four, we'll talk about common filter design.

784
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:55,000
 So how do we design a common filter that converges?

785
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:06,000
 And how can we use common filter measures to fuse multiple sensors for sensor integration?

786
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:16,000
 And then in week five, we'll talk about vision-based control, mainly two different measures.

787
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:28,000
 Position-based control and image-based control for this vision-based control measure.

788
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:35,000
 And also in the last class, we also have a quiz, as mentioned earlier.

789
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
 So in the quiz, we'll make many tests.

790
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:50,000
 The concepts covered in this class are also maybe, like say, some small calculations that involve some mathematics.

791
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:56,000
 Okay, next I will have a brief survey in this class.

792
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:20,000
 So this is the way, it's mainly about your knowledge in robotics and the sensors.

793
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:28,000
 And also your expectation in this topic.

794
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,000
 So basically there are two questions.

795
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:39,000
 What do you think have heard about robotics and intelligent sensors?

796
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:44,000
 Number two, what do you think you need to learn?

797
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:53,000
 Not just in this course, but overall, maybe like from other courses, maybe even in the future.

798
02:02:53,000 --> 02:03:02,000
 If you plan to work on robotics or intelligent systems in the future.

799
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:12,000
 After all, this is an emerging topic with very good career potential.

800
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:18,000
 Okay, so you guys can discuss among yourself.

801
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:26,000
 So like say, you can discuss with your friends and then provide some short answers to these questions.

802
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
 You don't have to write down your name.

803
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:32,000
 I just want to understand the class a bit.

804
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:36,000
 Okay, so after you finish, then the class is over.

805
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:47,000
 Okay, so you can discuss among yourself and then you pass me your answers.

806
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:51,000
 Then we have to leave, or you can stay here to ask me questions.

807
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
 So I will still be here to answer your questions if you have any.

808
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:18,000
 By the way, this is not required.

809
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
 So this is optional.

810
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,000
 Let's say if you don't want to provide input, it's also fine.

811
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
 It's not mandatory.

812
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
 Okay.

813
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
 Okay.

814
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
