 you

228
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 you

229
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 you

230
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 you

231
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 you

232
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 you

233
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 you

234
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 you

235
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 you

236
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 you

237
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 you

238
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 you

239
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 you

240
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 you

241
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 you

242
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 you

243
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 we are close to the end of this video.

244
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 So in this kind of research videos,

245
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 we are going to talk about the

246
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 robots

247
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 that move quite slow.

248
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 There can be multiple reasons for this.

249
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 One reason is the image processing.

250
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Because it takes a lot of

251
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 computational power to process

252
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 images.

253
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 So it can be

254
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 slow.

255
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 But now these

256
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 computers are becoming

257
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 much better.

258
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 So this program

259
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 is

260
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 not that

261
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 critical, not this.

262
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 So

263
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 just now

264
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 in

265
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 all the three examples that we saw,

266
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 cameras

267
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 are used as sensors

268
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 for those robots.

269
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 So

270
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 they are

271
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 camera-based

272
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 vision-guided

273
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 solutions for

274
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 the

275
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 performance

276
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 localization, navigation

277
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 and control.

278
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 So here we still have

279
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 two more examples, which I will show

280
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 to you guys a bit later.

281
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 So here we cover

282
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 some concepts

283
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 and geometry.

284
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 So these two examples

285
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 are recent examples with more advanced

286
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 applications.

287
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 We'll come back later for these two

288
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 applications.

289
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 What is

290
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 vision-based control and

291
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 estimation? So based on the name,

292
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 we can just

293
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 use the camera for this.

294
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 So vision-based control

295
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 and estimation is about

296
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 use of

297
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 image data

298
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 in feedback control

299
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 and state estimation

300
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 of

301
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 moving agents.

302
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 So here we make it quite general.

303
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 So these moving agents

304
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 include

305
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 ground robots, such as

306
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 mobile robots

307
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 on the ground

308
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 or

309
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 leg robots

310
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 or robot arms

311
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 or

312
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 UAVs.

313
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 The difference is that

314
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 these different robots

315
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 have different

316
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 dynamics.

317
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 You will make this frame

318
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 in general, where you will make

319
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 this frame in general.

320
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 We can use this block diagram

321
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 to show the main idea.

322
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 In this block diagram

323
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 we have four blocks.

324
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Plants,

325
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 sensing,

326
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 estimation

327
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 and control.

328
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 So you can see this is a closed loop.

329
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 So we close the loop

330
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 so that we can integrate

331
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 a different task together

332
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 to fulfill

333
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 certain applications.

334
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 The plant can be

335
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 a mobile robot

336
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 or can be a UAV

337
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 or can be a robotic arm.

338
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 To handle this

339
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 plant or robot well,

340
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 usually we should know its dynamics.

341
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 So we know

342
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 how its behavior can be changed

343
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 based on input.

344
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Either

345
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 a torque input

346
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 or force input

347
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 or velocity input.

348
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 So when we give this robot different inputs,

349
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 its motion or behavior

350
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 can be changed.

351
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 So even when there are dynamics,

352
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 it will be easier for us to handle.

353
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 If we do not know the dynamics,

354
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 we have to design

355
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 very

356
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 robust

357
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 or adaptive methods

358
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 to handle its dynamics.

359
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 So then the performance

360
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 may be

361
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 compromised.

362
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 So that is not as good as the case.

363
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 We will have

364
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 exact dynamics knowledge

365
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 for a robot.

366
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 So to do this

367
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 we should basically control an estimation.

368
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 So first we need to

369
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 find the dynamics

370
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 of the robot.

371
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 This area

372
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 covers

373
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 so it

374
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 involves physics

375
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 and dynamics.

376
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 The second block

377
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 is sensing.

378
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Some people also call it sensing and perception

379
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 or just perception.

380
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 It's about getting useful information

381
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 from

382
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 the sensors.

383
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 In this lecture

384
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 we focus on

385
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 vision sensors

386
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 or cameras.

387
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 So this sensing is about

388
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 deploying cameras

389
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 and processing images from

390
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 cameras.

391
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Here we have two pictures.

392
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 First picture at the bottom,

393
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 we can see a lot of

394
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 very small

395
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 green boxes

396
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 on the images.

397
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 They show us the features

398
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 extracted

399
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 from the images.

400
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 So the features

401
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 can be used to help

402
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 computer programs to understand

403
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 images.

404
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 So for humans

405
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 we understand images

406
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 in very intuitive ways.

407
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And quite often, even we don't understand

408
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 why we can understand

409
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 images.

410
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 But for robots, we cannot do this.

411
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 For robots, we should teach

412
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 the computer program

413
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 how to handle the images.

414
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 So usually, quite often

415
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 the first step

416
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 is to find the feature points

417
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 from the images.

418
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 So whether we can find the feature points

419
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 or features from images,

420
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 then we can have some algorithms

421
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 to do some tasks, such as

422
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 this multi-view

423
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 geometry.

424
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 So here, let's say we have multiple

425
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 images or multiple views.

426
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 And from them, we can

427
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 construct a 3D

428
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 3D

429
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 scenery.

430
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Here it is

431
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 a house.

432
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 So from the images, we can construct

433
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 a 3D

434
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 image of

435
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 a house.

436
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 And this is based on

437
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 multi-view geometry.

438
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 It is one topic in the area of

439
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 computer vision.

440
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 So to do this vision-based control

441
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 and estimation, the second

442
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 area

443
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 is computer vision.

444
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 So how we can get useful

445
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 information from images?

446
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 So

447
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 once we can handle the

448
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 images, the next

449
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 we can do

450
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 estimation, which is the third block.

451
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 It is estimation.

452
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 We can estimate a lot of different states,

453
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 such as a position,

454
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 velocity,

455
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 and sometimes even acceleration.

456
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 So this kind

457
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 of states can be estimated from

458
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 images using

459
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 various

460
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 algorithms,

461
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 such as camera filter-based

462
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 measures.

463
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 Nowadays, because of the

464
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 emerging of machine learning,

465
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 so

466
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 some people

467
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 use learning algorithms

468
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 to do state estimation.

469
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 For example, some deep learning

470
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 algorithms to do this.

471
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 So

472
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 all right.

473
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 The first block

474
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 is control. So here I use

475
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 what is control, but it can be more

476
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 general. It is not just

477
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 level control. It can

478
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 include

479
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 motion planning,

480
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 trajectory planning,

481
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 coordination between robots

482
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 or human-robot interaction,

483
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 et cetera.

484
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 So we have a quite a broad

485
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 topic.

486
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 So for this control, let's

487
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 just use control here.

488
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 So to do this control,

489
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 we need to close the loop.

490
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 We need to use

491
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 the measurements

492
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 from cameras

493
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 to provide feedback.

494
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Then we can close the loop.

495
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 There are many different control

496
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 measures.

497
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Like model-based, model-based

498
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 measures, model-free

499
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 measures.

500
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Nowadays, we have this

501
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 learning-based measures or AI-based

502
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 measures.

503
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 There are various

504
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 measures.

505
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 But no matter what we use,

506
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 there is one thing

507
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 in common between them,

508
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 which is feedback.

509
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 So that means

510
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 we use the measurements

511
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 from cameras

512
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 in an iterative way.

513
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 All right?

514
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 At each

515
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 sampling

516
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 period, so we

517
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 take images from the cameras.

518
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 We'll process the images

519
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 and then figure out

520
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 the actual state.

521
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Okay?

522
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Then we compare the actual state and the

523
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 desired state and use the error

524
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 to

525
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 change

526
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 the motion of the robot.

527
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 So this is a kind of...

528
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 This is an iterative process.

529
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 And we keep making

530
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 corrections

531
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 in

532
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 each

533
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 control period.

534
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 Okay.

535
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 There are many

536
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 different sensors.

537
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 Such as

538
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 cameras,

539
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 isn't it when you find

540
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 them, and we use

541
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 encoders, etc.

542
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 Okay.

543
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 So why do we want to

544
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 study this area?

545
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 Vision-based control.

546
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 Why is this useful?

547
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 So

548
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 here we have one picture.

549
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 So

550
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 in this picture

551
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 there are several

552
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 objects, such as

553
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 airplanes,

554
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 bigger ones,

555
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 smaller ones,

556
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 UAVs,

557
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 and also

558
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 the round of vehicles,

559
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 round robots.

560
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 So there can be

561
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 more machines,

562
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 more robots.

563
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 To handle these machines

564
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 so that

565
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 they can coordinate

566
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 and they can

567
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 complete certain tasks,

568
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 usually we need to know

569
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 their pose.

570
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 This means we need to know

571
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 their position

572
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 and the

573
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 orientation.

574
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Let's consider an airplane.

575
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 So

576
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 the position is x, y, z,

577
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 three-dimensional.

578
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 And for orientation

579
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 is

580
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 your picture row,

581
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 three different angles.

582
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 So in total,

583
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 we need three state variables

584
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 to represent

585
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 the

586
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 state of the airplane.

587
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 And we call this pose,

588
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 which means

589
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 position and orientation.

590
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 So usually this is

591
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 required

592
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 for navigation and control

593
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 of autonomous vehicles

594
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 or autonomous robots.

595
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 For the outdoor environment,

596
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 we can use GPS.

597
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 But if the GPS is not

598
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 available, they will have to find

599
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 alternative solutions, such as

600
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 vision-based solutions.

601
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 Let's say in this picture,

602
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 even if it is

603
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 an outdoor environment,

604
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 so let's say

605
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 when the vehicles

606
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 are very close

607
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 to top buildings,

608
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 GPS may be blocked.

609
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 So people call this

610
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 GPS

611
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 concentrated environment

612
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 so GPS deny the environment.

613
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 So GPS doesn't work

614
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 in this kind of environment.

615
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 They will have to use

616
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 another type of sensor.

617
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 For

618
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 indoor environment,

619
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 in this classroom,

620
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 we do not have GPS.

621
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 We should use some sensors

622
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 to provide measurements and feedback.

623
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 So vision provides a good

624
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 solution in this kind of environment.

625
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 M-Use can be used,

626
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 but M-U sometimes

627
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 have

628
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 error drift

629
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 so we cannot use it alone.

630
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 All right, so

631
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 these two points show us

632
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 the motivation to use vision

633
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 in navigation

634
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 and control for autonomous vehicles

635
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 and robots.

636
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 So here we have four different items.

637
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 They show us the advantages

638
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 of using

639
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 vision in robots

640
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 and vehicles.

641
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Number one,

642
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 vision is

643
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 a rich data set.

644
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 It has a lot

645
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 of potential

646
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 information.

647
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 Okay.

648
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 So let me show you one example.

649
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 Let's say if we use a vision

650
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 to control a robot in this classroom.

651
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 So pretty much

652
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 we can

653
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 see

654
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 how many students

655
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 are in this classroom

656
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 and where they are.

657
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 We can even

658
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 figure out who they are.

659
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 So let's say if you just use

660
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 a laser or UWB,

661
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 you do not have this kind of information.

662
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 And nowadays,

663
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 for some robots

664
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 or vehicles,

665
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 they are

666
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 teleoperated

667
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 by humans very far away.

668
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Okay.

669
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Next example, the UAVs

670
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 are used in one country.

671
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 All right.

672
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 And the operators are in another country

673
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 very far away.

674
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 So for this kind of teleoperation,

675
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 all right, so the human

676
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 need intuitive information

677
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 of the environment

678
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 or will need a lot of information

679
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 so vision provides

680
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 a good sensing

681
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 for that kind of

682
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 applications.

683
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 And number two,

684
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 vision is

685
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 a passive sensor.

686
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 It can't be

687
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 detected like Sona,

688
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 radar, laser,

689
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 etc.

690
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 All right.

691
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 So this means we can use camera to detect

692
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 some targets.

693
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 But the targets

694
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 do not know that

695
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 they're under

696
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 perception

697
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 or monitoring

698
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 by some sensors.

699
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 All right.

700
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 So this has

701
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 quite good applications

702
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 in certain

703
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 scenarios.

704
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 Number three, vision

705
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 is intuitive

706
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 to humans.

707
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 So this makes it

708
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 possible for teleoperation

709
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 of

710
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 autonomous vehicles,

711
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 robots.

712
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 And also this makes it even

713
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 possible for human and robots to have

714
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 better and better interactions.

715
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 Number four, cameras

716
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 are relatively cheap

717
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 and versatile.

718
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 There are many different types

719
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 of cameras that we can choose

720
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 for different

721
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 applications.

722
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 So they have different

723
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 resolutions,

724
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 different

725
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 sampling frequency

726
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 or frame rate.

727
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 And the prices

728
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 are also quite different depending on

729
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 the resolutions and the functions

730
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 provided by the cameras.

731
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 This picture shows

732
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 some industrial

733
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 cameras

734
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 which can be used for

735
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 robotic arms or ground

736
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 robots.

737
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 So in the first class

738
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 I passed some cameras around

739
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 in the classroom

740
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 and you guys took a look.

741
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 So for those cameras

742
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 the prices are not

743
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 very expensive, just several hundred

744
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 dollars and

745
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 they have quite a high

746
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 resolution and also quite good frequency

747
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 rate.

748
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 So this slide shows

749
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 the advantages

750
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 of cameras.

751
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 It is not easy

752
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 to use a camera's

753
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 vision in a

754
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 robotic project.

755
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 So let's say if we want

756
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 to do vision-based control

757
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 for a robot,

758
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 if we want to use cameras

759
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 to get the motion

760
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 of a robot

761
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 we have to address

762
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 quite a few challenges.

763
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 Number one,

764
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 robust

765
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 and real-time

766
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 vision estimation.

767
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 In about 40 years ago

768
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 people started to use

769
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 cameras

770
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 to get the motion of a robot.

771
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 But

772
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 at that time

773
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 the applications

774
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 were very limited.

775
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 One reason is that

776
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 the computers at that time

777
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 were

778
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 very poor.

779
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 So

780
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 it's very difficult to process

781
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 images obtained by

782
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 the cameras.

783
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 But nowadays

784
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 the hardware

785
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 is much better.

786
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 Even 15 years ago

787
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 if you want to process images

788
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 you may have to use a very powerful

789
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 server to do it.

790
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 But nowadays you can just use

791
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 a normal laptop

792
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 to handle it very well.

793
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 With better hardware

794
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 we can now do real-time

795
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 image processing.

796
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 Usually images

797
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 have noises.

798
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 Especially for low-cost cameras.

799
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 In 1990s

800
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 for one camera

801
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 the cost may be more than

802
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 5,000 US dollars.

803
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 So very expensive.

804
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 But the performance is not that good.

805
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 So nowadays the cameras

806
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 are much cheaper.

807
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 With much better resolution

808
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 higher frame rate.

809
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 So that

810
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 we can have

811
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 robust

812
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 feedback from

813
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 the cameras.

814
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 This is a challenge

815
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 with the development

816
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 of technologies, with the development

817
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 of hardware.

818
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 This one

819
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 is not that critical anymore.

820
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 Number two.

821
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 Feedback

822
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 through a transformation from 3D

823
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 to 2D.

824
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 So we live in a 3D world.

825
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 It is a 3D space.

826
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 Images

827
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 are 2D information.

828
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 It is a 2D space.

829
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 So in our model

830
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 or in the closed loop

831
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 so we have to

832
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 handle this feedback from

833
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 3D to 2D.

834
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 So in this process basically we have

835
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 lost

836
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 some information

837
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 in this imaging process.

838
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 So in the

839
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 vision-based control

840
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 framework, we have to deal

841
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 with this loss

842
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 of information.

843
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 So this is one challenge.

844
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 Loss of

845
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 depth information

846
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 during imaging projection.

847
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 So this can be kind of combined.

848
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 Number four.

849
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 Camera calibration

850
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 uncertainty.

851
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 So the camera calibration

852
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 actually

853
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 gives us the camera calibration

854
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 model.

855
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 The camera model serves as a bridge

856
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 between the 2D space

857
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 and the 3D world.

858
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 Or between the 2D images

859
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 and the 3D applications.

860
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 If this calibration

861
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 is not very accurate

862
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 so that means

863
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 this bridge

864
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 has some problem.

865
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 They will have to deal with this

866
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 problem in the control framework.

867
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 If the calibration is perfect

868
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 they will have to worry about it.

869
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 So this is

870
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 one point

871
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 that we have influence on the

872
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 performance.

873
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 Number five.

874
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 The field of view.

875
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 For a normal camera

876
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 it can only

877
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 measure

878
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 objects

879
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 in certain

880
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 angles.

881
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 And that angle is called field of view.

882
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 So it can be 60 degrees

883
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 or 90 degrees.

884
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 If the obstacles

885
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 or objects

886
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 are outside the field of view

887
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 how do we handle it?

888
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 This is also a challenge for vision

889
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 based control and applications.

890
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 I'm not sure

891
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 why some of you visited a Jurem point recently.

892
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 In Jurem point

893
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 I noticed

894
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 there are some robots

895
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 who deployed there for cleaning.

896
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 I took a look at the robot.

897
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 On top of the robot

898
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 there were four cameras.

899
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 And these four cameras

900
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 face different directions.

901
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 So this is

902
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 1P200

903
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 this limited field of view.

904
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 Like I said, if one camera can provide us

905
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 90 degrees

906
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 field of view.

907
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 If you use four, you can cover

908
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 all different

909
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 directions.

910
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 Number six,

911
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 relative motion

912
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 between

913
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 targets.

914
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 We can take a look at this picture

915
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 with multiple

916
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 airplanes

917
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 and multiple ground vehicles.

918
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 If we

919
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 let them coordinate, next example

920
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 to let the airplane track

921
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 ground vehicles.

922
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 So we have 100 relative motion between them.

923
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 Some of them move faster

924
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 some of them move slower.

925
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 So we have to deal with this

926
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 relative motion.

927
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 I believe that most of you

928
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 have watched

929
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 this kind of air show

930
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 somewhere.

931
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 So people can

932
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 show

933
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 pictures

934
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 using a large number

935
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 of small

936
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 UAVs.

937
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 So to handle

938
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 that many

939
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 of UAVs.

940
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
 So we need to make sure that they don't

941
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 collide into each other.

942
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 So we have to control the relative motion between them

943
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 very well.

944
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 This is also one challenge.

945
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 Number seven,

946
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 nonlinear

947
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 multiple differential equations

948
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 with unmeasurable states.

949
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
 Basically this means that

950
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 for different robots, the dynamics

951
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 can be quite complicated.

952
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 They can be

953
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 nonlinear with even

954
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 uncertainties in the dynamics.

955
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 If we want to handle

956
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 the motion of that robot

957
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 or vehicle well, we should

958
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 know their dynamics.

959
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 We should know those differential equations

960
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 very accurately.

961
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 So if we do not

962
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 know some uncertainty

963
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 or some nonlinearity

964
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 in the dynamics,

965
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 we will have a design in very advanced

966
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 control measures

967
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 to take care of that nonlinearity

968
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 or uncertainty.

969
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 This quite often is very challenging

970
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 or very difficult to do.

971
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
 So these are the

972
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 challenges for vision-based

973
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 control.

974
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
 This topic has been

975
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 an investigation

976
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 for over 40 years.

977
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
 People all around the world

978
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 have already found many different

979
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
 measures to handle this topic.

980
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 In week five, we will talk about some

981
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 measures for vision-based control.

982
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 Okay.

983
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 So next, I will show you

984
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 one framework

985
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 for vision-based control

986
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 and estimation.

987
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 So this kind of shows us

988
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 the big picture

989
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 of this technology.

990
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 So how

991
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 we integrate

992
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 different pieces of techniques

993
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 and provide a complete solution

994
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 for vision-based control applications.

995
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 We can start

996
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 from

997
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 the control object.

998
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 It can be

999
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
 a UAV

1000
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
 or it can be

1001
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
 a

1002
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 ground vehicle.

1003
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 This picture is actually

1004
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 the mass rover.

1005
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 So it's autonomous robot

1006
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 used for mass

1007
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 exploration.

1008
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 And this picture was

1009
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
 taken many years ago.

1010
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 Okay.

1011
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
 So in the past,

1012
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 it was just imagination.

1013
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
 Like I said, someday

1014
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
 people may explore

1015
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
 Mars.

1016
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 Okay.

1017
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 And now this

1018
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
 kind of

1019
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 vision

1020
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 is getting closer

1021
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 to reality.

1022
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 Okay.

1023
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
 In this framework,

1024
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 the main sensor

1025
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
 is

1026
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 a camera.

1027
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
 But here we have space

1028
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 for other sensors.

1029
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
 Like if you want to use a laser-reinforcer

1030
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
 if you want to use UWB,

1031
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 if you want to use MU,

1032
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 you can place them

1033
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
 into this framework.

1034
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 From the camera,

1035
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 we can have images.

1036
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
 So the images are obtained

1037
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
 at a certain sampling frequency.

1038
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 Usually we call it

1039
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 the frame rate for the camera.

1040
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
 Then for the images,

1041
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
 we can use

1042
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 image processing algorithms

1043
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
 to process the images

1044
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
 and get useful information

1045
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
 such as

1046
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 feature points,

1047
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 detection

1048
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
 and tracking.

1049
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
 And then from images,

1050
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
 we can do

1051
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
 all kinds of estimation.

1052
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
 State estimation,

1053
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
 motion estimation,

1054
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 geometry estimation,

1055
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 3D scene,

1056
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
 reconstruction, etc.

1057
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
 The objective

1058
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 is to

1059
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 get

1060
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
 useful state variables

1061
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
 that can be used

1062
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
 in

1063
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
 robotic manipulation,

1064
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
 motion planning, control, etc.

1065
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
 After we get

1066
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 useful information,

1067
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
 then we can

1068
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
 use this information

1069
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 for control.

1070
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
 OK,

1071
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
 now let's take a break.

1072
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
 We'll start at about

1073
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
 750.

1074
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 During the break,

1075
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 if you have any questions,

1076
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
 you can come here and let me know.

1077
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 Thank you.
