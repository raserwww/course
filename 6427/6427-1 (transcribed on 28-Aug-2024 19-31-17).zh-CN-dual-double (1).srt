10
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 This is the first time I'm here in such a big LT

10
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
这是我第一次来到这么大的LT

11
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
所以这确实是一个非常大的 LT。

13

有很多很多电子邮件。

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I think I receive about six

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
我想我收到了大约六个

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 or seven hundred applications

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
或七百个申请

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 for the projects. So actually,

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
对于项目。所以实际上，

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I'm overwhelmed with the email for the past

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
我对过去的电子邮件感到不知所措

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 few weeks. So for those

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
几周。所以对于那些

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 students, if you write in

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
同学们，如果你写

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 during this period and if I do not

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
在此期间，如果我不这样做

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 respond, please try to be understanding

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
回复，请尽量理解

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 because there are just too many

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
因为太多了

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 email applications for the

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
电子邮件申请

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 projects for the past one week or so.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
过去一周左右的项目。

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Okay, but moving forward, yeah,

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
好吧，但继续前进，是的，

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 when you write in, I'll definitely respond to you.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
当你写信的时候，我一定会回复你。

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Okay, so this is the

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
好的，这就是

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 course outline for

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
课程大纲

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 this particular course. So it's divided

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
这门特殊的课程。所以就分了

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 into six parts. So

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
分为六个部分。所以

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 first of all, the first thing we are going to look at

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
首先，我们首先要看的是

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 is the introduction and basics.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
是介绍和基础知识。

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Before I continue, can I just check

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
在继续之前，我可以检查一下吗

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 the students at the back? Can you all hear me?

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
后面的学生呢？你们都能听到我说话吗？

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Okay, great.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
好的，太好了。

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Okay, and then

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
好吧，然后

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 part two, we are going to look at image

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
第二部分，我们将看图像

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 compression and JPEG standard.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
压缩和 JPEG 标准。

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Okay, and then part three, we'll be looking

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
好的，然后第三部分，我们会寻找

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 at video compression and standards.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
视频压缩和标准。

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And then afterwards, part four

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
然后是第四部分

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 we'll be moving on to some AI

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
我们将继续讨论一些人工智能

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 models and architectures.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
模型和架构。

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Okay, and then part five, we'll be

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
好的，然后第五部分，我们会

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 looking at some video analysis

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
看一些视频分析

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 and understanding. And then finally,

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
和理解。最后，

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 part six, we'll be looking at some emerging

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
第六部分，我们将关注一些新兴的

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 topics and image and video processing.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
主题以及图像和视频处理。

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 So that's a general overview

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
这是一般概述

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 of the course.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
当然。

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 So you can see pretty much

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
所以你可以看到很多

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 the earlier part tends to be

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
前面的部分往往是

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 more focusing on

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
更专注于

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 compression, so video

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
压缩，所以视频

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 compression. And the

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
压缩。还有

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 second half of the

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
的后半段

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 course tends to be more on

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
当然更倾向于

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 AI and then the video analytics.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
人工智能，然后是视频分析。

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 So these are the two

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
所以这是两个

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 key focus for this particular

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
这个特定的重点

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 course.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
课程。

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Okay, so for this course, there are

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
好的，对于本课程，有

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 some references. Of course, nowadays

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
一些参考资料。当然，如今

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 you can make use of different

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
你可以利用不同的

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 tools to help you to do the learning.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
帮助您进行学习的工具。

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 You should try to make use

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
你应该尝试利用

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 of all the tools, which include, for example,

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
所有工具，其中包括，例如，

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 usual ones like Google's.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
常见的比如谷歌的。

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 You should also use the

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
您还应该使用

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 chat.gbt and other

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
聊天.gbt 和其他

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 resources like Quora and

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Quora 等资源

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 also some traditional textbooks.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
还有一些传统的教科书。

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 So by all means, if you have any

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
所以无论如何，如果你有的话

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 questions regarding the course,

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
有关课程的问题，

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 make use of all the resources out there

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
利用所有的资源

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 to help you to do the learning.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
帮助您完成学习。

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 But of course, if you are using tools

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
但当然，如果您使用工具

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 like chat.gbt, you have to be

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
就像chat.gbt一样，你必须是

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 a little bit more careful because the content

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
稍微小心一点，因为内容

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 that's being presented may not

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
所呈现的内容可能不会

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 be 100% accurate.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
100%准确。

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Right, okay, so this slide is the

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
好的，好的，这张幻灯片就是

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 standard slide that the school actually

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
学校实际上的标准幻灯片

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 suggests us to include, which is just to

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
建议我们包括，这只是为了

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 remind you that the materials

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
提醒您，材料

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 in the slides are copyrighted by

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
幻灯片中的版权归

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 respective publishers and authors.

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
各自的出版商和作者。

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And the slides should only be

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
幻灯片应该只

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 used for your own personal studies.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
用于您自己的个人研究。

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So no

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
所以不

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 part of the slides should be recorded, reproduced

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
部分幻灯片应被记录、复制

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 or distributed without the

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
或未经分发

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 permission of the author.

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
作者的许可。

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 So the reason why we have this is that

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
所以我们有这个的原因是

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I mean for some of you, probably you already

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
我的意思是对于你们中的一些人来说，可能你们已经

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 know, right,

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
知道，对，

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 there are some students who actually

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
有一些学生实际上

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 go and record

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
去记录

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 the material and then afterwards sell

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
材料然后出售

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 it online. Right? There are some

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
它在线。正确的？有一些

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 websites like Course Hero,

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
诸如课程英雄之类的网站，

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 actually you can find the lecture notes,

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
其实你可以找到讲义，

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 the exercises, the

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
练习，

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 assignment as well as the solution online.

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
作业以及在线解答。

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 So therefore we do not encourage

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
因此我们不鼓励

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 you all to record it.

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
大家来记录一下吧。

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 So it's to stop that.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
所以要阻止这种情况。

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Okay.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
好的。

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Right, so for many of you,

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
是的，所以对于你们很多人来说，

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 this is probably one of the most

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
这可能是最重要的之一

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 important things you would like to look at for

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
您想要查看的重要内容

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 a course. So for this course, in terms

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
一门课程。所以对于本课程而言

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 of the assessment, it's pretty

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
评价来说，还是蛮漂亮的

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 standard throughout for

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
标准贯穿始终

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 MSc courses. So the

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
理学硕士课程。所以

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 first component is examination.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
第一个组成部分是考试。

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 So examination will account for

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
所以考试会考虑

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 60%.

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
60%。

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 So it consists of

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
所以它包括

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 four questions. So you have to answer

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
四个问题。所以你必须回答

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 all the four questions and

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
所有四个问题以及

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 it will be closed book. Okay? So it's a

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
这将是封闭的书。好的？所以这是一个

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 closed book examination at the end

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
闭卷考试结束

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 of the semester.

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
学期的。

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 In addition to that, there's also

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
除此之外，还有

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 this continuous assessment.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
这种持续的评估。

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 So continuous assessment is 40%.

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
所以持续考核是40%。

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 It will consist of

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
它将包括

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 two CA. So the first

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
两个CA。所以第一个

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 one is homework assignment.

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
一是家庭作业。

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So this homework assignment, I plan to

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
所以这个作业我打算

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 release it around week five

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
第五周左右发布

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 or week six around that time.

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
或大约在那个时候的第六周。

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So it will be a homework assignment

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
所以这将是一项家庭作业

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 which is 20%.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
即 20%。

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 And the second component is

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
第二个组成部分是

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 quiz, which will account for

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
测验，这将说明

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 another 20%. So this

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
另外20%。所以这个

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 quiz will likely occur around

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
测验可能会发生在

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 week 11 or week 12.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
第 11 周或第 12 周。

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So once it's a little bit closer,

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
所以一旦距离稍微近一点

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 I will inform you regarding the quiz

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
我会通知您有关测验的信息

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 arrangement.

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
安排。

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 So far, are there any questions?

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
到目前为止，还有什么问题吗？

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Do you hear any echo?

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
你听到任何回声吗？

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 The sound quality is okay.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
音质还可以。

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Okay, so next

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
好的，那么接下来

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 we'll move on to part one on the

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
我们将继续讨论第一部分

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 introduction of this

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
对此的介绍

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 course here. So this, today's

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
当然在这里。那么今天这个

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 lecture is pretty much on introduction

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
讲座主要是介绍

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 so you can more like sit back and relax.

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
这样您就可以更加高枕无忧。

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Yeah, and then after

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
是的，然后之后

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 the introduction, then we'll formally move into

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
介绍完了，接下来我们就正式进入

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 the more technical part

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
更具技术性的部分

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 of the course. But the first part

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
当然。但第一部分

181
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 will be mainly on introduction

181
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
将以介绍为主

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 and basics.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
和基础知识。

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Right, so in part one, these

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
是的，所以在第一部分中，这些

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 are the topics we are going to cover. So

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
是我们要讨论的主题。所以

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 first of all, we are going to introduce

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
首先我们要介绍的是

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 the basic concept about image

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
图像的基本概念

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 and video. So what are actually images

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
和视频。那么图像到底是什么

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 and videos? And then we'll be looking

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
和视频？然后我们会寻找

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 at some selected different topics

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
在一些选定的不同主题

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 of video signal processing and application.

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
视频信号处理及应用.

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Because if you think about

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
因为如果你想

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 video, right, video signal

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
视频，右，视频信号

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 processing, actually the title itself is very

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
处理，其实标题本身就很

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 broad. It can cover many,

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
广阔。可以涵盖很多，

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 many different aspects of video signal

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
视频信号的许多不同方面

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 processing. It's a very broad

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
加工。这是一个非常广泛的

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 topic. But as I

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
话题。但正如我

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 mentioned, for this particular course

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
提到，对于这个特定的课程

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 there will be two key focus that we'll be

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
我们将有两个重点

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 focusing on. One is the coding

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
专注于.一是编码

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 and compression, okay, and communication.

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
和压缩，好吧，还有沟通。

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 The second one is on

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
第二个已开启

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 the analysis and analytics

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
分析与分析

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 and understanding. So these are the

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
和理解。所以这些是

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 two key focus for

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
两个关键焦点

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 this particular course here.

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
这门特殊的课程在这里。

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Okay, so in the first part,

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
好的，所以在第一部分中，

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 as I mentioned, the first

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
正如我提到的，第一个

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 important part will be on the

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
重要的部分将在

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 image and video standard. So

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
图像和视频标准。所以

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 we'll be talking about different types

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
我们将讨论不同类型

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 of compression, such as

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
的压缩，例如

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 we'll start off with image compression,

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
我们将从图像压缩开始，

214
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 and afterwards we'll move on to video

214
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
然后我们将继续观看视频

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 compression. So in the process

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
压缩。所以在这个过程中

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 of introducing this compression

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
引入这种压缩

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 techniques, we'll also introduce

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
技术，我们还将介绍

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 some standards that you

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
你认为的一些标准

219
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 probably have heard of, such as

219
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
可能听说过，比如

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 JPEG image compression,

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
JPEG图像压缩，

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 video compression, you probably heard about

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
视频压缩，您可能听说过

222
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 MPEG as well as H.26x

222
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
MPEG 以及 H.26x

223
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 series of compression.

223
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
系列压缩。

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 So those are the topics

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
所以这些就是主题

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 we're going to cover in the first

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
我们将在第一部分介绍

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 part of the course.

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
课程的一部分。

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Afterwards we'll move on to the second part,

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
接下来我们将进入第二部分，

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 where we'll be talking about video

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
我们将在这里讨论视频

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 analysis and understanding.

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
分析和理解。

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 So in order to do that, we'll try to introduce

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
因此，为了做到这一点，我们将尝试引入

231
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 some AI models.

231
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
一些人工智能模型。

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 So we'll first of all try to cover

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
所以我们首先要尝试涵盖

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 concepts such as linear classifier,

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
线性分类器等概念，

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 convolutional

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
卷积的

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 neural network, recurrent neural

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
神经网络、循环神经网络

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 network, LSTM,

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
网络、LSTM、

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 and then transformer, and then probably

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
然后变压器，然后可能

238
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 some of the relevant concepts.

238
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
一些相关的概念。

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 So we'll try to introduce those basic

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
所以我们将尝试介绍这些基本的

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 AI models first, and afterwards we'll

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
首先进行人工智能模型，然后我们将

241
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 proceed to look at some sample video

241
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
继续观看一些示例视频

242
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 analytics application,

242
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
分析应用程序，

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 such as object

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
比如物体

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 detection, multiple object

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
检测，多个物体

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 tracking, post estimation,

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
跟踪、事后估计、

246
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 action recognition in

246
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
动作识别

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 videos. So those are the topics we'll cover.

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
视频。这些就是我们将要讨论的主题。

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And then finally, under the

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
最后，在

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 emerging topics, we'll try

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
新兴主题，我们会尝试

250
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 to cover some recent trends.

250
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
涵盖一些最近的趋势。

251
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 So specifically, we'll

251
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
那么具体来说，我们将

252
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 probably be talking about some large language

252
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
可能正在谈论一些大型语言

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 model, and also some

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
模型，还有一些

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 foundation models, in the

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
基础模型，在

255
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 context of video analytics.

255
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
视频分析的背景。

256
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 So that's a general overview

256
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
这是一般概述

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 of this particular course here.

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
这门特殊课程的介绍在这里。

258
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 So first,

258
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
所以首先，

259
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 let's look at the image and video

259
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
让我们看一下图片和视频

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 basics.

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
基础知识。

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 So what is an image? I think most of you

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
那么什么是图像呢？我想你们大多数人

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 should be familiar with image

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
应该熟悉图像

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 already. So an image is nothing

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
已经。所以图像什么都不是

264
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 but if you think about it, it's actually a two-dimensional

264
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
但如果你仔细想想，它实际上是一个二维的

265
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 array, or a matrix

265
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
数组，或矩阵

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 of pixel elements.

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
像素元素。

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 So you have a two-dimensional array

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
所以你有一个二维数组

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 of small elements here.

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
这里的小元素。

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 So each of the smallest elements is

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
所以每个最小的元素是

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 known as a pixel. So pixels stand

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
称为像素。所以像素站

271
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 for picture element.

271
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
对于图片元素。

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 So image is an important media

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
所以形象是一个重要的媒体

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 for us to convey the information.

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
以便我们传达信息。

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 So we need to store it,

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
所以我们需要存储它，

275
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 we need to process, and we need to present

275
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
我们需要处理，我们需要呈现

276
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 it. So that's the basic

276
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
它。这就是基本的

277
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 understanding of what an image is.

277
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
了解图像是什么。

278
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 So it's represented by a two-dimensional

278
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
所以用二维表示

279
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 matrix, or

279
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
矩阵，或

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 two-dimensional array of pixels here.

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
这里是二维像素数组。

281
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So for example, you can see this is an

281
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
例如，您可以看到这是一个

282
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 image. So this image

282
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
图像。所以这个图像

283
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 consists of different rows

283
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
由不同的行组成

284
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 of pixels here.

284
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
这里的像素数。

285
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 So each of the basic elements is a pixel.

285
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
所以每个基本元素都是一个像素。

286
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 So there are many

286
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
所以有很多

287
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 different popular image formats,

287
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
不同流行的图像格式，

288
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 such as JPEG,

288
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
例如 JPEG、

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 which stands for Joint Photographic Expert Group,

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
代表联合摄影专家组，

290
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 and then

290
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
进而

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 TIFF, TAC, Image File Format,

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
TIFF、TAC、图像文件格式、

292
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 BMP, Bitmap Format, and so on.

292
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
BMP、位图格式等。

293
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 So for this course, we'll spend

293
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
所以对于本课程，我们将花费

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 some time to talk about

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
有时间谈谈

295
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 the techniques for image compression,

295
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
图像压缩技术，

296
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 as well as the underlying principle

296
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
以及基本原则

297
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 for JPEG image compression.

297
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
用于 JPEG 图像压缩。

298
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 So that's

298
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
所以那就是

299
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 the basic

299
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
基本的

300
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 parts regarding the image

300
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
关于图像的部分

301
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 compression that we're going to study.

301
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
我们要研究的压缩。

302
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And then before

302
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
然后之前

303
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 we continue, as I mentioned

303
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
正如我提到的，我们继续

304
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 for this lecture, we are going to

304
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
对于本次讲座，我们将

305
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 talk about some of the basics to

305
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
谈谈一些基础知识

306
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 make sure that everyone has a common understanding

306
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
确保每个人都有共同的理解

307
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 and is familiar with

307
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
并且熟悉

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 the terms that we are using.

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
我们正在使用的术语。

309
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 So first of all, we're going

309
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
所以首先我们要

310
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 to introduce the concept of pixels and resolution.

310
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
介绍像素和分辨率的概念。

311
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 So I believe everyone

311
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
所以我相信大家

312
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 should understand what a pixel is.

312
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
应该明白什么是像素。

313
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 So pixels

313
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
所以像素

314
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 represent picture elements.

314
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
代表图片元素。

315
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 So it's the smallest element in

315
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
所以它是最小的元素

316
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 a digital image. So if you look

316
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
数字图像。所以如果你看

317
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 at this particular image here,

317
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
在这个特定的图像中，

318
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 it consists of a two-dimensional

318
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
它由一个二维的

319
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 array or matrix of

319
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
的数组或矩阵

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 pixels.

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
像素。

321
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 So if you zoom in

321
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
所以如果你放大

322
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 these parts of the image, if you zoom in

322
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
如果放大图像的这些部分

323
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 in, then you can see each of these

323
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
然后你就可以看到其中的每一个

324
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 pixels a lot more clearly.

324
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
像素更清晰。

325
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 So each of these particular elements here

325
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
所以这里的每一个特定元素

326
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 is known as a pixel, which is

326
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
被称为像素，即

327
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 the picture element.

327
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
图片元素。

328
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 So another associated

328
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
所以另一个关联

329
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 concept with image

329
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
概念与图像

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 is resolution. So what is the meaning

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
是分辨率。那么意义何在

331
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 of resolution? Resolution means the number

331
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
分辨率？分辨率是指数量

332
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 of pixels in the image. So there's

332
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
图像中的像素数。所以有

333
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 a few different ways you can express

333
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
几种不同的表达方式

334
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 the number of pixels in the image.

334
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
图像中的像素数。

335
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 You can simply express

335
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
你可以简单地表达

336
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 it in terms of the total pixel count.

336
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
就总像素数而言。

337
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 For example, you can say that this particular

337
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
例如，您可以说这个特定的

338
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 image is 10 megapixel.

338
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
图像为 10 兆像素。

339
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 That means this image actually

339
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
这意味着这张图片实际上

340
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 consists of 10 megapixels

340
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
由10兆像素组成

341
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 of pixels. Or it

341
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
像素。或者它

342
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 can be expressed as width times

342
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
可以表示为宽度乘以

343
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 height. For example,

343
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
高度。例如，

344
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 for first

344
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
首先

345
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 total pixel count, for example, if you say an image

345
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
总像素数，例如，如果您说图像

346
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 can be 5 megapixels.

346
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
可以是5兆像素。

347
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 In terms of, you can

347
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
就而言，你可以

348
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 also express it as width times height.

348
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
也将其表示为宽度乘以高度。

349
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 An example is 640 by

349
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
一个例子是 640

350
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 480. So what it means is that

350
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
480.所以这意味着

351
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 you have the number, the row

351
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
你有数字，行

352
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 is 640 and the height

352
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
是640，高度

353
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 is 480.

353
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
是 480。

354
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 So this is the dimension of your image.

354
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
这就是你的图像的尺寸。

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Another way of

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
另一种方式

356
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 expressing this resolution

356
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
表达本决议

357
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 in the context of printing and

357
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
在印刷和

358
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 scanning is this pixel

358
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
扫描的是这个像素

359
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 per inch, or PPI.

359
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
每英寸，或 PPI。

360
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 So for example, when you say that you are trying

360
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
例如，当你说你正在尝试时

361
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 to print a certain document, you need

361
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
要打印某个文档，您需要

362
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 to indicate how many pixels per inch.

362
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
表示每英寸有多少个像素。

363
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 In one inch of space,

363
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
一英寸的空间里，

364
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 how many pixels can you squeeze it?

364
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
你能压缩多少像素？

365
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 So these are different ways for you

365
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
所以这些对你来说是不同的方式

366
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 to express the resolution.

366
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
来表达决心。

367
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 So you can see this resolution

367
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
所以你可以看到这个分辨率

368
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 pretty much is trying to reflect

368
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
几乎是在试图反映

369
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 the ability for you

369
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
适合你的能力

370
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 to distinguish or

370
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
来区分或

371
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 differentiate fine details in an image.

371
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
区分图像中的精细细节。

372
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 So if you look at this small image and you

372
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
所以如果你看这张小图片并且你

373
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 zoom it in, clearly, if

373
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
放大它，清楚地，如果

374
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 you have a higher resolution, that means

374
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
你有更高的分辨率，这意味着

375
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 you can pack more information into it.

375
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
您可以将更多信息放入其中。

376
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 That means you will be able to see a lot more details.

376
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
这意味着您将能够看到更多详细信息。

377
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 So that is the

377
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
所以这就是

378
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 basic idea of resolution.

378
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
决议的基本思想。

379
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 So the next term that we are going to introduce

379
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
所以我们要介绍的下一个术语

380
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 is bit depth or color depth.

380
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
是位深度或颜色深度。

381
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 So what is bit depth and color depth?

381
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
那么什么是位深度和颜色深度呢？

382
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 So bit depth or color depth is the number

382
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
所以位深度或颜色深度就是数字

383
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 of bits used to represent

383
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
用于表示的位数

384
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 each pixel.

384
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
每个像素。

385
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 So if you look at these images

385
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
所以如果你看这些图片

386
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 here, there are three types of images

386
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
这里有三种类型的图像

387
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 here. So the first one is a binary

387
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
这里。所以第一个是二进制的

388
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 image.

388
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
图像。

389
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 So you can see binary image because it consists of

389
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
所以你可以看到二值图像，因为它由

390
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 either, you know, the color can

390
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
要么，你知道，颜色可以

391
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 only be either black or

391
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
只能是黑色或

392
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 white. So if it's black or white,

392
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
白色的。所以无论是黑色还是白色

393
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 that means how many bits do you

393
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
这意味着你有多少位

394
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 need to represent it?

394
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
需要代表吗？

395
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 If it's for a binary

395
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
如果是二进制文件

396
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 image, it only can have

396
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
图像，它只能有

397
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 two colors, which is either black or white.

397
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
两种颜色，即黑色或白色。

398
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 So if it's either black or white, how many

398
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
那么如果它是黑色或白色，有多少

399
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 bits do you need to represent each pixel?

399
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
您需要表示每个像素的位吗？

400
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 One,

400
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
一，

401
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 because it can only have two possible values.

401
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
因为它只能有两个可能的值。

402
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 So therefore, for binary images

402
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
因此，对于二值图像

403
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 like this, you only need to have one bit

403
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
像这样，你只需要一点

404
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 represented, okay? Because it's either

404
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
代表，好吗？因为它要么是

405
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 black or white.

405
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
黑色或白色。

406
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 So the next time is a grayscale images.

406
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
所以接下来的时间是灰度图像。

407
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 So these are examples of grayscale

407
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
这些是灰度的例子

408
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 images. So these are probably like

408
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
图像。所以这些可能就像

409
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 your grandparents' generations of

409
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
你的祖父母辈

410
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 photos or my

410
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
照片或我的

411
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 mother's generation of photos.

411
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
母亲一代的照片。

412
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 So these are the grayscale images here.

412
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
这些是这里的灰度图像。

413
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 So very often, we use

413
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
所以很多时候我们会使用

414
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 eight bits represented.

414
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
表示八位。

415
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 So if we use eight bits to represent it,

415
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
所以如果我们用八位来表示它，

416
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 that means how many possible

416
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
这意味着有多少种可能

417
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 gray levels or tones can

417
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
灰度级或色调可以

418
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 it show?

418
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
它显示？

419
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 For each pixel?

419
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
对于每个像素？

420
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Sorry?

420
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
对不起？

421
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 256,

421
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
256、

422
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 so it's two to the power of eight

422
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
所以它是二的八次方

423
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 because for each bit

423
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
因为对于每一位

424
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 you can have two possible values. So two

424
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
你可以有两个可能的值。那么两个

425
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 times two times two, you times it

425
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
乘以二乘以二，你乘以它

426
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 eight times, then it's two to the power of eight,

426
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
八次，那么就是二的八次方，

427
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 which is 256

427
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
这是 256

428
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 possible gray

428
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
可能的灰色

429
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 level. So this is a

429
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
等级。所以这是一个

430
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 this image here is an example

430
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
这张图片是一个例子

431
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 of grayscale images here.

431
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
此处的灰度图像。

432
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And if you zoom in this more

432
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
如果你再放大一点

433
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 pixel blocks here,

433
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
这里的像素块，

434
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 you can see this is the examples of grayscale

434
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
你可以看到这是灰度的例子

435
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 images. For grayscale

435
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
图像。对于灰度

436
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 images and binary image, it

436
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
图像和二值图像，它

437
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 only consists of one channel

437
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
仅由一个通道组成

438
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 or one component.

438
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
或一个组件。

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 So for this binary

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
所以对于这个二进制文件

440
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 or grayscale image, it only has

440
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
或灰度图像，它只有

441
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 one channel

441
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
一个通道

442
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 or one component.

442
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
或一个组件。

443
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 So and then for each component,

443
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
那么对于每个组件，

444
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 if you zoom it in, just now

444
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
如果你放大它，就现在

445
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 we already know if we use eight bits

445
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
我们已经知道是否使用八位

446
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 to represent it, that means you can have

446
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
代表它，这意味着你可以有

447
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 256 gray

447
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
256灰色

448
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 level. So this 256

448
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
等级。所以这个256

449
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 gray level typically we represent

449
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
我们通常代表的灰度级

450
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 from zero to 255.

450
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
从零到 255。

451
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 So zero to 255.

451
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
所以从 0 到 255。

452
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And if it's smaller, if the

452
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
如果它更小，如果

453
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 value is smaller, that means it's darker.

453
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
值越小，表示颜色越暗。

454
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 If the value is larger, that means

454
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
如果该值较大，则意味着

455
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 it's brighter. So you can see for example,

455
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
它更亮了。所以你可以看到，例如，

456
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 for smaller value

456
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
对于较小的值

457
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 each byte 51 here is actually

457
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
这里的每个字节51实际上是

458
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 corresponds to darker pixel.

458
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
对应于较暗的像素。

459
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And if the value is larger such as

459
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
如果该值较大，例如

460
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 177,

460
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
177、

461
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 it corresponds to brighter pixel.

461
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
它对应于更亮的像素。

462
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 So that's the

462
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
这就是

463
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 basic understanding.

463
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
基本了解。

464
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 So the next types of image that we have

464
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
所以我们接下来的图像类型

465
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 is color images. So this color image

465
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
是彩色图像。所以这个彩色图像

466
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 is very common. That's what we see every

466
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
很常见。这就是我们每一次看到的

467
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 day. So this is an example

467
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
天。这是一个例子

468
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 of the color image.

468
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
的彩色图像。

469
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 So if you look at this particular

469
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
所以如果你看看这个特定的

470
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 color image, again it consists of

470
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
彩色图像，同样它由以下组成

471
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 different pixels here.

471
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
这里有不同的像素。

472
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Each of these is actually a

472
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
其中每一个实际上都是一个

473
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 pixel. And each of

473
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
像素。并且每一个

474
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 this pixel will consist of a triplet

474
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
该像素将由一个三元组组成

475
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 of value. That means it has three values

475
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
的价值。这意味着它具有三个值

476
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 here. Triplets of value. So each

476
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
这里。价值三元组。所以每个

477
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 of these pixels here would have red,

477
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
这里的这些像素将是红色的，

478
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 green and blue. So for example,

478
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
绿色和蓝色。例如，

479
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 these pixels here will consist of

479
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
这里的这些像素将包括

480
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 red, green and blue. So it has three

480
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
红色、绿色和蓝色。所以它有三个

481
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 channels. So red,

481
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
渠道。那么红，

482
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 green and blue are referred

482
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
绿色和蓝色被引用

483
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 to as three channels or

483
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
作为三个通道或

484
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 three components.

484
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
三个组成部分。

485
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 So typically,

485
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
所以通常情况下，

486
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 because each of these

486
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
因为这些中的每一个

487
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 channels or components,

487
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
通道或组件，

488
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 we use eight bits to represent it.

488
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
我们用八位来表示它。

489
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 So therefore, each pixel now

489
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
因此，现在每个像素

490
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 can be represented as three times

490
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
可以表示为三倍

491
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 eight, which is 24 bits.

491
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
八位，即 24 位。

492
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 So that is the

492
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
所以这就是

493
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 basic visualizations

493
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
基本可视化

494
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 of how we represent different

494
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
我们如何代表不同

495
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 types of images.

495
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
图像类型。

496
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 So the next thing we are going to

496
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
所以接下来我们要做的就是

497
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 look at is some

497
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
看看有一些

498
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 column color

498
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
列颜色

499
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 spaces. So what are color

499
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
空间。那么什么是颜色

500
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 spaces? So just now, the color

500
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
空格？所以刚才的颜色

501
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 image that we've shown, we know that

501
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
我们已经展示的图像，我们知道

502
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 color image, again, consists

502
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
彩色图像再次由

503
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 of a two-dimensional array or

503
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
二维数组或

504
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 matrix of pixels. And for each

504
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
像素矩阵。并且对于每个

505
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 pixel, it can be shown

505
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
像素，可以显示

506
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 as triplets of value.

506
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
作为价值的三元组。

507
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 The example that was shown is red,

507
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
显示的示例是红色的，

508
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 green and blue. RGB.

508
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
绿色和蓝色。 RGB。

509
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 But this particular way of representing

509
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
但这种特殊的表示方式

510
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 the color image is not

510
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
彩色图像不是

511
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 the only way. So there are actually

511
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
唯一的办法。所以实际上有

512
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 many different ways you can represent

512
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
您可以用多种不同的方式来表示

513
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 color images. So different

513
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
彩色图像。如此不同

514
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 ways of representing color images

514
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
表示彩色图像的方法

515
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 are known as color

515
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
被称为颜色

516
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 spaces or color model.

516
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
空间或颜色模型。

517
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 So there's many different ways

517
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
所以有很多不同的方法

518
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 you can represent colors,

518
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
你可以代表颜色，

519
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 images.

519
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
图像。

520
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And this is known as color spaces.

520
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
这就是所谓的色彩空间。

521
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 So this particular figure

521
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
所以这个特定的数字

522
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 shows some of the examples.

522
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
显示了一些示例。

523
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 For example, red, green, blue is one

523
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
例如，红、绿、蓝是其中之一

524
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 common color space.

524
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
共同的色彩空间。

525
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 HSI hue saturation

525
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
HSI 色调饱和度

526
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 intensity is another common

526
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
强度是另一个常见的

527
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 color space. And later on,

527
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
色彩空间。后来，

528
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 you're going to see why CBCR

528
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
你就会明白为什么 CBCR

529
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 is also another common color

529
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
也是另一种常见的颜色

530
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 space. We are going to

530
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
空间。我们要去

531
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 look at each of these color spaces

531
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
查看每个色彩空间

532
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 and also talk about why,

532
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
并谈谈原因，

533
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 in some cases, we want to use this color

533
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
在某些情况下，我们想使用这种颜色

534
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 space, and in some cases, we use

534
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
空间，在某些情况下，我们使用

535
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 another color space.

535
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
另一个色彩空间。

536
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 So let's try to look at,

536
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
那么让我们试着看看，

537
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 first of all, color

537
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
首先，颜色

538
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 images again. So color images

538
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
再次图像。所以彩色图像

539
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 can be expressed in terms of different color

539
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
可以用不同的颜色来表达

540
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 spaces, as I mentioned. There's many different

540
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
正如我提到的，空格。有很多不同的

541
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 ways you can express the color.

541
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
表达颜色的方式。

542
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 So some of the common color space

542
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
那么一些常见的色彩空间

543
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 is RGB. For example,

543
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
是RGB。例如，

544
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 the image that we have just now earlier on

544
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
我们刚才看到的图像

545
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 shown is RGB images.

545
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
显示的是 RGB 图像。

546
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 HSI is another popular

546
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
恒生指数是另一个受欢迎的指数

547
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 one, and why CBCR

547
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
一、为什么 CBCR

548
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 is another popular one. So this

548
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
是另一种流行的。所以这个

549
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 why CBCR color space is

549
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
为什么 CBCR 色彩空间是

550
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 commonly used in standards

550
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
标准中常用的

551
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 such as image and video

551
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
例如图像和视频

552
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 compression and TV transmission.

552
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
压缩和电视传输。

553
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 So these are the color space that's commonly

553
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
这些是常见的色彩空间

554
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 used in those applications

554
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
在这些应用程序中使用

555
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 here. So if you look at RGB

555
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
这里。所以如果你看一下 RGB

556
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 color space, you can see

556
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
色彩空间，你可以看到

557
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 the color is represented by

557
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
颜色表示为

558
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 triplets. Now we say each pixel has three

558
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
三胞胎。现在我们说每个像素有三个

559
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 values. So these three values

559
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
价值观。所以这三个值

560
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 are triplets of value as

560
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
值的三元组为

561
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 red, green and blue, RGB.

561
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
红、绿、蓝，RGB。

562
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 So if you look at

562
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
所以如果你看

563
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 this particular

563
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
这个特定的

564
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 color model

564
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
色彩模型

565
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 here, I think this is some color

565
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
在这里，我想这是某种颜色

566
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 model that you probably, for most students,

566
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
对于大多数学生来说，你可能会认为，

567
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 you study in secondary school.

567
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
你在中学学习。

568
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 So you have the primary color,

568
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
所以你有原色，

569
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 which is red,

569
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
是红色的，

570
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 green and blue. So if you

570
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
绿色和蓝色。所以如果你

571
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 add red and green, you'll

571
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
添加红色和绿色，你会

572
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 get yellow, red and blue you'll get

572
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
得到黄色，红色和蓝色你会得到

573
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 magenta, and then green

573
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
洋红色，然后绿色

574
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 and blue you'll get cyan. And if

574
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
和蓝色你会得到青色。如果

575
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 you add these three colors, you'll get a white

575
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
你添加这三种颜色，你会得到白色

576
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 color. So this is the standard

576
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
颜色。所以这是标准

577
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 additive color model

577
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
加色模型

578
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 that you study in secondary school.

578
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
你在中学学习。

579
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 So another

579
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
那么另一个

580
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 visualizations of this particular primary

580
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
这个特定初级的可视化

581
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 color, we can also visualize it in terms

581
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
颜色，我们也可以用术语来形象化它

582
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 of a color cube. So we visualize

582
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
的颜色立方体。所以我们想象

583
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 it in the color cube, then red,

583
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
它在颜色立方体中，然后是红色，

584
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 this axis is red,

584
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
该轴是红色的，

585
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 this axis is green, and

585
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
该轴是绿色的，并且

586
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 this axis is blue here.

586
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
该轴在这里是蓝色的。

587
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 So red will take the values of

587
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
所以红色将取以下值

588
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 1, 0, 0.

588
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
1, 0, 0。

589
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Green is 0, 1, 0.

589
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
绿色是 0, 1, 0。

590
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 And blue is 0, 0, 1.

590
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
蓝色是 0, 0, 1。

591
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 So it's like the unit values along

591
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
所以就像单位值一样

592
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 this axis here.

592
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
这个轴在这里。

593
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And then as we have seen,

593
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
然后正如我们所看到的，

594
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 red plus green will give you yellow.

594
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
红色加绿色会得到黄色。

595
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 So this corner will be yellow.

595
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
所以这个角会是黄色的。

596
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Red and blue

596
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
红色和蓝色

597
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 will be magenta. This corner will be

597
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
将是洋红色。这个角落将会是

598
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 magenta, and blue and green,

598
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
洋红色、蓝色和绿色，

599
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 this corner will be cyan.

599
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
这个角将是青色的。

600
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And if you add up these three colors, then this

600
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
如果你把这三种颜色加起来，那就是

601
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 particular diagonal, the corner

601
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
特定的对角线、角

602
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 will be the white color. So

602
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
将是白色。所以

603
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 this particular corner will be

603
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
这个特定的角落将是

604
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 white color, and if the value is

604
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
白色，如果值为

605
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 0, 0, 0, then it's black color.

605
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
0, 0, 0，那么它是黑色。

606
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 So if you draw a line to connect

606
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
所以如果你画一条线来连接

607
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 the black to the white, this

607
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
从黑到白，这个

608
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 will correspond to the grayscale

608
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
将对应于灰度

609
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 representation.

609
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
表示。

610
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 So this is the representation

610
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
所以这就是代表

611
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 of the RGB color cube.

611
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
RGB 颜色立方体。

612
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 So a little bit more

612
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
所以再多一点

613
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 about the RGB

613
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
关于RGB

614
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 images. So earlier on

614
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
图像。所以早些时候

615
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 we mentioned, typically we represent

615
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
我们提到，通常我们代表

616
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 as 24 bits color images.

616
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
作为 24 位彩色图像。

617
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 So if you look at this particular

617
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
所以如果你看看这个特定的

618
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 color image, you

618
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
彩色图像，你

619
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 divide into three different channels.

619
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
分为三个不同的通道。

620
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 You have the red channel, green channel,

620
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
你有红色通道，绿色通道，

621
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 and the blue channel. So an image,

621
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
和蓝色通道。所以一个图像，

622
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 typically, a color image, if you

622
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
通常是彩色图像，如果您

623
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 represent in terms of RGB color,

623
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
以 RGB 颜色表示，

624
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 images, that means there's three

624
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
图像，这意味着有三个

625
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 channels, and then each of these channels you can

625
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
频道，然后您可以

626
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 actually separate them. Then

626
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
实际上将它们分开。然后

627
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 this is what you're going to get, these three channels

627
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
这就是你将得到的，这三个频道

628
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 here. Okay, so you can

628
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
这里。好的，所以你可以

629
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 see that each pixel has three

629
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
看到每个像素有三个

630
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 components, red, green, and blue, you already know.

630
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
成分，红色，绿色和蓝色，你已经知道了。

631
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And then for each component, for each

631
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
然后对于每个组件，对于每个

632
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 pixel, we use eight bits to represent

632
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
像素，我们用八位来表示

633
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 it. Right, so therefore

633
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
它。对，所以所以

634
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 for each channel, because we use

634
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
对于每个通道，因为我们使用

635
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 eight bits, that means it has two

635
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
八位，这意味着它有两个

636
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 56 tones,

636
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
56个音调，

637
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 and the value that it represents is

637
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
它代表的值是

638
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 from 0 to 255.

638
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
从 0 到 255。

639
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And if the color is black,

639
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
如果颜色是黑色，

640
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 it's 000, and it's white,

640
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
它是 000，它是白色的，

641
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 it's 255, 255,

641
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
是 255、 255、

642
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 255, in terms of the

642
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
255、就

643
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 color representation.

643
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
颜色表示。

644
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And also, if you look at this

644
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
而且，如果你看看这个

645
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 particular image, if you break it into the

645
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
特定的图像，如果你把它分解成

646
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 three channels, you can see

646
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
三个频道，你可以看到

647
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 for example this red channel here,

647
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
例如这里的红色通道，

648
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 this area that corresponds to

648
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
该区域对应于

649
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 the red color, when you

649
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
红色，当你

650
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 look at the red channel here,

650
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
看这里的红色通道，

651
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 the value is actually

651
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
该值实际上是

652
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 brighter or whiter.

652
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
更亮或更白。

653
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 That's because how we represent this

653
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
那是因为我们如何表示这一点

654
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 color is that, as we

654
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
颜色就是这样，就像我们

655
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 have mentioned before, if the value

655
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
之前已经提到过，如果值

656
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 is larger, it's whiter

656
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
更大，更白

657
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 or it's brighter. And if the value

657
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
或者它更亮。如果值

658
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 is smaller, it's darker

658
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
越小，颜色越暗

659
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 or blacker. So therefore,

659
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
或者更黑。因此，

660
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 if you look at the red channel, because the

660
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
如果你看红色通道，因为

661
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 red channel actually reflects the red

661
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
红色通道实际上反映了红色

662
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 component, so this region

662
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
组件，所以这个区域

663
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 corresponds to the red component

663
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
对应红色分量

664
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 here. So that's why their values

664
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
这里。这就是为什么他们的价值观

665
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 are larger, and because

665
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
更大，并且因为

666
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 their values are larger, they are indicated

666
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
它们的值较大，表示

667
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 as brighter.

667
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
更明亮。

668
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Other regions that, for example,

668
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
其他地区，例如，

669
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 doesn't contain that much red color,

669
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
不含那么多红色，

670
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 it will be

670
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
这将是

671
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 darker.

671
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
更暗。

672
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 So if you now look at the green channel,

672
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
所以如果你现在看看绿色通道

673
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 you can see these regions here contain the

673
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
你可以在这里看到这些区域包含

674
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 green channel, so that's why

674
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
绿色通道，所以这就是为什么

675
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 their value is larger and

675
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
它们的价值更大并且

676
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 hence a little bit brighter.

676
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
因此稍微亮一点。

677
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And then finally, for this particular

677
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
最后，对于这个特殊的

678
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 image, you can see because there's hardly any

678
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
图片，你可以看到，因为几乎没有

679
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 blue component, so therefore

679
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
蓝色分量，因此

680
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 if you look at the blue channel, most of them

680
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
如果你看蓝色通道，大多数

681
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 are dark, which indicate

681
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
是黑色的，这表明

682
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 that their value is very small,

682
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
它们的价值非常小，

683
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 that means not much blue component.

683
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
这意味着蓝色成分不多。

684
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Okay, so just now we have introduced

684
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
好的，刚才我们已经介绍了

685
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 one very common color space,

685
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
一种非常常见的色彩空间，

686
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 which is RGB color space.

686
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
这是RGB色彩空间。

687
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 So the next class of color

687
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
所以下一类颜色

688
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 space that we are going to

688
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
我们要去的空间

689
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 show is the YUV,

689
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
显示的是YUV，

690
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 YIQ and YCBCR color space.

690
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
YIQ 和 YCBCR 色彩空间。

691
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 So this

691
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
所以这个

692
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 color space is another scheme

692
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
色彩空间是另一种方案

693
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 to represent color images.

693
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
来表示彩色图像。

694
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 So for this particular color

694
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
所以对于这种特殊的颜色

695
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 images, that means actually the images

695
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
图像，这实际上意味着图像

696
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 will be represented by three different

696
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
将由三个不同的代表

697
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 channels again. But this

697
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
再次频道。但这

698
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 three different channels now will be

698
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
现在将有三个不同的渠道

699
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 the Y channel, if you look

699
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Y 通道，如果你看的话

700
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 at this YUV

700
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
在这个YUV

701
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 channel, that means this three channel will be

701
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
通道，这意味着这三个通道将是

702
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 represented by Y channel,

702
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
由Y通道表示，

703
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 U channel and V channel

703
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
U通道和V通道

704
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 now. So this is another

704
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
现在。所以这是另一个

705
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 way of representing

705
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
表示方式

706
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 the color image.

706
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
彩色图像。

707
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 And YIQ and YCBCR

707
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
还有 YIQ 和 YCBCR

708
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 are actually just a very

708
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
实际上只是一个非常

709
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 similar to YUV,

709
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
与YUV类似，

710
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 they are just a small variation, slightly

710
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
它们只是一个小的变化，稍微

711
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 different.

711
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
不同的。

712
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 So pretty much, as I've

712
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
非常多，正如我所经历的那样

713
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 already explained, YIQ

713
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
已经解释过了，YIQ

714
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 and YCBCR

714
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
和YCBCR

715
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 are small variations of

715
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
是小的变化

716
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 YUV channel, color

716
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
YUV通道、颜色

717
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 space. Therefore, typically we consider

717
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
空间。因此，通常我们考虑

718
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 them as more or less the same.

718
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
它们或多或少是相同的。

719
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 So among this color space,

719
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
所以在这个色彩空间中，

720
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 for example, if we use the YUV

720
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
例如，如果我们使用 YUV

721
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 as the example here,

721
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
作为这里的例子，

722
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 this Y channel corresponds

722
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
该Y通道对应

723
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 to luminance channel. So

723
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
到亮度通道。所以

724
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 luminance means the brightness part,

724
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
亮度表示亮度部分，

725
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 the black and white, the

725
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
黑与白，

726
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 brightness part.

726
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
亮度部分。

727
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 So the luminance is actually

727
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
所以亮度实际上是

728
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 the brightness part or the black and white

728
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
亮度部分或黑白

729
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 parts of the image.

729
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
图像的部分。

730
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 And then the UV actually

730
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
然后实际上是紫外线

731
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 corresponds to the chrominance part.

731
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
对应色度部分。

732
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 So this UV refers to the

732
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
所以这个UV指的是

733
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 chrominance part. So chrominance

733
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
色度部分。所以色度

734
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 means it's the color part of the image.

734
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
意味着它是图像的颜色部分。

735
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Okay, color part of the

735
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
好的，给部分颜色上色

736
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 image.

736
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
图像。

737
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 So, this,

737
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
所以，这个，

738
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 why do we want to, in some cases,

738
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
为什么在某些情况下我们想要

739
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 represent an image or

739
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
代表一个图像或

740
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 video in terms of YUV,

740
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
以 YUV 表示的视频，

741
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 YIQ or YCBCR

741
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
YIQ 或 YCBCR

742
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 color space? For example,

742
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
色彩空间？例如，

743
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 in video broadcasting,

743
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
在视频广播中，

744
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 typically we use these types

744
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
通常我们使用这些类型

745
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 of color space, YUV,

745
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
色彩空间，YUV，

746
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 YIQ,

746
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
益智商,

747
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 and for JPEG and image,

747
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
对于 JPEG 和图像，

748
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 JPEG and

748
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
JPEG 和

749
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 MPEG compression, we use YCBCR.

749
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
MPEG压缩，我们使用YCBCR。

750
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 So why do we want

750
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
那么我们为什么要

751
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 to use this kind of color space

751
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
使用这种颜色空间

752
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 in video broadcasting

752
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
在视频广播中

753
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 or

753
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
或者

754
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 compression? So here the

754
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
压缩？所以这里的

755
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 answer is, it makes good

755
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
答案是，这很好

756
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 use of the bandwidth. But what exactly

756
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
带宽的使用。但到底是什么

757
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 does that mean?

757
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
这是什么意思？

758
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Okay.

758
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
好的。

759
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I mean, for example, in

759
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
我的意思是，例如，在

760
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 this

760
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
这

761
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 video broadcasting,

761
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
视频广播、

762
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 you can choose to represent

762
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
你可以选择代表

763
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 your image and video as RGB.

763
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
您的图像和视频为 RGB。

764
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 But if you do that,

764
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
但如果你这样做的话

765
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 when you want to do the transmission,

765
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
当你想要进行传输时，

766
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 it's not so efficient.

766
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
它不是那么有效。

767
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 As compared to if you decided

767
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
与如果你决定相比

768
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 to change this color space

768
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
改变这个色彩空间

769
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 from RGB to

769
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
从 RGB 到

770
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 YCBCR or

770
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
YCBCR 或

771
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 YUV color space.

771
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
YUV 色彩空间。

772
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 So when you represent the image and

772
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
所以当你代表图像并且

773
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 video using YUV

773
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
使用 YUV 的视频

774
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 color space, and then when you do

774
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
色彩空间，然后当你这样做时

775
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 the transmission,

775
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
传输，

776
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 we can do it in a more efficient

776
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
我们可以更有效地做到这一点

777
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 manner. So anyone

777
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
方式。所以任何人

778
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 has any idea why is that the case?

778
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
知道为什么会这样吗？

779
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Yes.

779
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
是的。

780
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Okay.

780
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
好的。

781
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 So,

781
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
所以，

782
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 yeah, what

782
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
是的，什么

783
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 you're trying to explain is more

783
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
你试图解释的是更多

784
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 like the temporal

784
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
就像暂时的

785
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 correlation.

785
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
相关性。

786
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Okay, the similarity

786
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
好吧，相似度

787
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 across different frames,

787
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
跨越不同的框架，

788
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 yeah, when you're trying to

788
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
是的，当你试图

789
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 do the transmission.

789
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
进行传输。

790
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Okay, so in the context of

790
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
好的，所以在上下文中

791
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 compression, because each

791
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
压缩，因为每个

792
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 frames, okay, consecutive frames

792
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
帧，好的，连续帧

793
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 are very similar, so you

793
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
非常相似，所以你

794
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 only need to encode the small difference.

794
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
只需要对微小的差异进行编码。

795
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 I believe that's what you are coming from.

795
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
我相信这就是你的出身。

796
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 But still, it does not

796
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
但仍然没有

797
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 clearly explain what's the difference.

797
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
清楚地解释有什么区别。

798
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Why? I mean, for,

798
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
为什么？我的意思是，为了，

799
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 if you represent the image as RGB

799
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
如果将图像表示为 RGB

800
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 or YCBCR,

800
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
或YCBCR，

801
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 okay, now I mean both of them,

801
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
好吧，现在我指的是他们两个，

802
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 you can also

802
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
你也可以

803
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 leverage on the similarity

803
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
利用相似性

804
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 or the inter-frame

804
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
或帧间

805
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 correlation for you to help to perform

805
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
相关性可以帮助您执行

806
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 the compression. But it still

806
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
压缩。但它仍然

807
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 doesn't really quite explain why

807
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
并没有真正解释为什么

808
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 one color space is better

808
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
一种颜色空间更好

809
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 than the other color space.

809
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
比其他色彩空间。

810
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Any other

810
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
任何其他

811
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 thought?

811
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
想法？

812
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Okay, so one of the reasons why in

812
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
好的，原因之一是

813
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 the context of video transmission,

813
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
视频传输的背景下，

814
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 okay, compression and then

814
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
好的，压缩然后

815
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 TV transmissions, why we

815
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
电视传输，为什么我们

816
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 want to represent the color in these

816
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
想要代表这些颜色

817
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 types of YCBCR color spaces,

817
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
YCBCR 色彩空间的类型，

818
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 is that once we convert

818
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
一旦我们转换

819
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 the color space from RGB

819
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
来自 RGB 的色彩空间

820
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 into this YCBCR,

820
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
进入这个YCBCR，

821
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 YUV color space,

821
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
YUV色彩空间，

822
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 for example, this white part

822
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
例如这个白色部分

823
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 just now we mentioned, it corresponds to

823
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
刚才我们提到的，它对应的是

824
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 the luminance part,

824
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
亮度部分，

825
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 which is the brightness component.

825
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
这是亮度分量。

826
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And this UV corresponds

826
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
而这个UV对应的是

827
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 to the chrominance part, which is the

827
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
到色度部分，即

828
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 color component. So the next

828
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
颜色成分。那么接下来

829
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 thing that you need to know is the

829
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
你需要知道的是

830
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 how human viscous system works.

830
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
人体粘性系统如何工作。

831
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Our human viscous systems

831
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
我们的人体粘性系统

832
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 are, right in our eye, there's actually

832
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
是，就在我们的眼中，实际上有

833
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 two types of cell, rot and cone.

833
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
两种类型的细胞，腐烂细胞和圆锥细胞。

834
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Probably if you

834
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
也许如果你

835
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 can still remember what you

835
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
仍然记得你的事

836
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 study in the secondary school biology.

836
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
学习中学生物学。

837
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 You know our human eye,

837
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
你知道我们人眼，

838
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 the retina, actually has

838
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
视网膜，实际上有

839
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 two types of

839
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
两种类型的

840
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 this light

840
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
这光

841
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 kind of sensitive cell that

841
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
一种敏感细胞

842
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 can perceive the light. One is a rot,

842
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
可以感知光。一个是腐烂，

843
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 the other is a cone.

843
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
另一个是圆锥体。

844
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 So one of them is sensitive to

844
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
所以其中之一是敏感的

845
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 the color component,

845
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
颜色分量，

846
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 the other is sensitive to the brightness

846
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
另一个对亮度敏感

847
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 component. That's why

847
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
成分。这就是为什么

848
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 in the

848
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
在

849
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 middle of the night,

849
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
半夜，

850
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 if you wake up and when you go to the

850
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
如果你醒来并且当你去

851
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 toilet, actually what you can see

851
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
厕所，其实就是你所看到的

852
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 is a gray color. You cannot

852
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
是灰色的。你不能

853
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 see the color, but you can see only the

853
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
看到颜色，但只能看到

854
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 grayscale, the brightness.

854
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
灰度，亮度。

855
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 That's because our eyes are more sensitive

855
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
那是因为我们的眼睛比较敏感

856
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 to the luminance

856
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
到亮度

857
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 component. So all in all,

857
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
成分。所以总而言之，

858
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 what I'm trying to say is that for human

858
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
我想说的是对于人类来说

859
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 viscous system, actually our eye is

859
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
粘性系统，实际上我们的眼睛是

860
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 more sensitive to the luminance component

860
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
对亮度分量更敏感

861
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 as compared to the

861
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
相比于

862
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 chrominance component, or the color

862
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
色度分量，或颜色

863
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 component. So because our eyes

863
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
成分。所以因为我们的眼睛

864
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 are more sensitive

864
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
更敏感

865
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 to the luminance component

865
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
到亮度分量

866
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 and less sensitive to the chrominance

866
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
对色度不太敏感

867
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 component, that means

867
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
组件，这意味着

868
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 we can afford to throw away

868
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
我们可以扔掉

869
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 some of the information

869
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
一些信息

870
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 in the chrominance component.

870
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
在色度分量中。

871
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Because it makes very little difference

871
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
因为差别很小

872
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 to us. So traditionally,

872
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
对我们来说。所以传统上，

873
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 because we know that, for example,

873
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
因为我们知道，例如，

874
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 for video transmission,

874
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
用于视频传输，

875
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 it requires lots of bandwidth.

875
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
它需要大量的带宽。

876
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 So bandwidth is very expensive.

876
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
所以带宽非常昂贵。

877
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 So therefore, you want to reduce

877
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
因此，你想减少

878
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 the number of bits that you want to

878
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
您想要的位数

879
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 transmit. Okay. And then

879
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
发送。好的。进而

880
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 it's very logical now,

880
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
现在这是非常合乎逻辑的

881
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 if our eyes are more sensitive to the

881
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
如果我们的眼睛对

882
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 white channel, or white

882
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
白色通道，或白色

883
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 component, then we should keep

883
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
组件，那么我们应该保留

884
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 all the information in white. And

884
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
所有信息均为白色。和

885
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 if our eyes are less sensitive

885
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
如果我们的眼睛不那么敏感

886
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 to the chrominance component,

886
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
到色度分量，

887
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 then we can afford to throw

887
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
那么我们就可以扔掉

888
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 away some of the information, by

888
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
带走一些信息，通过

889
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 dropping away some of the pixels.

889
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
丢弃一些像素。

890
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Okay. So therefore, in short,

890
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
好的。因此，简而言之，

891
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 what I'm trying to say is that, now,

891
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
我想说的是，现在，

892
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 if you represent your image and

892
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
如果你代表你的形象并且

893
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 video into this kind of

893
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
视频变成这种

894
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 color space, there's a very

894
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
色彩空间，有一个非常

895
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 simple strategy for you to

895
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
简单的策略让你

896
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 reduce the number of

896
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
减少数量

897
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 bits that you need to transmit over

897
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
您需要传输的位

898
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 the channel.

898
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
频道。

899
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 For example, doing

899
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
例如，做

900
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 the TV transmission. What you need to do

900
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
电视传输。你需要做什么

901
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 is keep all the white channel, drop

901
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
保留所有白色通道，丢弃

902
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 some of, or sub-sample,

902
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
一些或子样本，

903
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 or drop some of the information from your

903
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
或删除您的一些信息

904
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 chrominance component. So that's

904
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
色度分量。所以那就是

905
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 why this particular color space

905
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
为什么这个特定的色彩空间

906
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 is a lot easier for

906
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
更容易

907
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 you to decide what to do, as opposed

907
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
你来决定做什么，而不是

908
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 to RGB. So, for example,

908
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
至 RGB。所以，举例来说，

909
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 if your video is RGB,

909
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
如果您的视频是 RGB，

910
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 you cannot, no, there's no

910
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
你不能，不，没有

911
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 very clear strategy. Now, if you want

911
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
非常明确的策略。现在，如果你想要

912
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 to drop some pixel, what are the pixel

912
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
删除一些像素，该像素是什么

913
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 you want to drop, or what are the channel you want

913
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
你想要删除，或者你想要什么频道

914
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 to drop? It's not so clear cut.

914
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
下降？这不是那么明确。

915
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Okay. So that is the reason.

915
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
好的。这就是原因。

916
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 So, because of that,

916
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
所以，正因为如此，

917
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 this color space is commonly used in TV

917
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
该色彩空间常用于电视

918
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 industry and video compression.

918
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
工业和视频压缩。

919
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 So, for example, YUV

919
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
例如，YUV

920
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 is used in this PAL and

920
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
在此 PAL 中使用并且

921
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 CCAM TV standard.

921
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
CCAM 电视标准。

922
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 YQ is used

922
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
使用YQ

923
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 in NTSC, and YCBCR

923
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
NTSC 和 YCBCR

924
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 is commonly used in JPEG and

924
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
常用于 JPEG 和

925
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 MPEG compression. So, later

925
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
MPEG 压缩。所以，后来

926
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 on, when we study about JPEG and

926
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
当我们研究 JPEG 时

927
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 MPEG compression, we'll be mainly dealing

927
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
MPEG压缩，我们主要处理

928
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 with this color space here.

928
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
这里有这个色彩空间。

929
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 And then for

929
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
然后对于

930
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 different color space, RGB,

930
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
不同的色彩空间，RGB，

931
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 and this, okay, in this particular

931
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
这个，好吧，在这个特定的情况下

932
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 table, it shows the conversion

932
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
表，它显示了转换

933
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 between RGB and YQ.

933
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
RGB 和 YQ 之间。

934
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 So, you can actually just do a simple

934
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
所以，你实际上可以做一个简单的

935
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 conversion by some matrix

935
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
通过一些矩阵转换

936
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 multiplication to convert from one

936
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
乘法从一转换

937
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 color space to another color space.

937
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
颜色空间到另一个颜色空间。

938
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Okay. So,

938
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
好的。所以，

939
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 the next thing we want to very quickly

939
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
接下来我们想要很快

940
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 touch on is CODAC.

940
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
触及的是CODAC。

941
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 So, does

941
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
那么，

942
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 any one of you know what this company

942
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
你们中的任何一个人都知道这家公司是什么

943
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 is, CODAC?

943
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
是，CODAC？

944
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Anyone

944
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
任何人

945
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 know CODAC?

945
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
知道科达克吗？

946
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Camera.

946
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
相机。

947
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Okay, long time ago, right? What you heard is

947
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
好吧，很久以前了，对吧？你听到的是

948
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 long time ago. Actually, I still remember

948
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
很久以前。其实我还记得

949
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 when I was a young kid,

949
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
当我还是个小孩子的时候

950
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 my brother bought

950
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
我哥哥买了

951
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 the first kind of camera.

951
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
第一种相机。

952
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Yeah. So, at the time, I was very

952
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
是的。所以，当时我非常

953
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 excited. You have to take this

953
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
兴奋的。你必须接受这个

954
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 camera, and then you actually have to

954
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
相机，然后你实际上必须

955
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 think very carefully exactly

955
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
仔细思考

956
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 what is the photo you want to capture.

956
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
您想要拍摄什么照片。

957
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Because every photo, once you click it,

957
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
因为每张照片，一旦你点击它，

958
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 you capture it. It's already

958
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
你捕捉到它。已经是

959
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 one film that's been

959
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
曾经的一部电影

960
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 taken already. So,

960
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
已经采取了。所以，

961
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 it's very expensive, it's very precious.

961
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
它非常昂贵，非常珍贵。

962
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Unlike nowadays, when you have

962
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
与现在不同的是，当你拥有

963
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 mobile phone, you can just keep taking photo.

963
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
手机就可以继续拍照。

964
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 You don't like, you just delete. But in the past,

964
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
你不喜欢就删掉吧但在过去，

965
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 the photos are actually

965
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
这些照片实际上是

966
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 using this kind of

966
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
使用这种

967
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 camera is using from

967
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
相机正在使用

968
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 this kind of

968
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
这种

969
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 analog film for you to take

969
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
模拟胶片供您拍摄

970
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 the photo. So, this company,

970
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
照片。那么，这家公司，

971
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 CODAC, used to be a very big

971
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
CODAC，曾经是一个非常大的

972
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 company, very, very important. When people talk about

972
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
公司，非常非常重要。当人们谈论

973
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 camera, they just think of CODAC.

973
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
相机，他们只想到CODAC。

974
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 So, it's just a very big

974
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
所以，这只是一个非常大的

975
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 company. So, in

975
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
公司。所以，在

976
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 the past, it's actually very dominant.

976
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
过去，它实际上非常占主导地位。

977
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 But, later

977
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
但是，后来

978
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 on, because they make

978
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
上，因为他们使

979
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 lots of money from this firm,

979
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
从这家公司赚了很多钱

980
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 analog firm that you have. But

980
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
你拥有的模拟公司。但

981
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 later on, when time starts to change,

981
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
后来，当时间开始改变时，

982
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 this digital photography

982
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
这个数码摄影

983
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 and digital camera

983
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
和数码相机

984
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 and filming start to appear, actually

984
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
实际上，拍摄开始出现

985
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 CODAC is

985
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
科达克是

986
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 very resistant to

986
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
非常抵抗

987
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 changing.

987
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
改变。

988
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 The reason is quite straightforward,

988
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
原因很简单，

989
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 because they are making so much money from making

989
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
因为他们赚了很多钱

990
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 this firm. So, when there's a new

990
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
这家公司。所以，当有新的

991
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 technology appearing,

991
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
科技的出现，

992
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 digital camera, so they are very

992
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
数码相机，所以它们非常

993
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 resistant to

993
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
抵抗

994
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 switch from analog camera to digital

994
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
从模拟相机切换到数字相机

995
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 camera. Whereas,

995
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
相机。然而，

996
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 other companies such as

996
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
其他公司，例如

997
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Fuji, actually they manage

997
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
富士，实际上他们管理

998
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 to do the transition much

998
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
做很多过渡

999
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 more quicker. So, in short, this

999
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
更快。所以，简而言之，这

1000
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 particular slide is trying to show

1000
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
特别的幻灯片试图展示

1001
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 that sometimes you have to

1001
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
有时你必须

1002
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 move on with technology.

1002
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
继续技术进步。

1003
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 When technology changes,

1003
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
当技术发生变化时，

1004
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 you just have to follow. Otherwise,

1004
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
你只需要跟随。否则，

1005
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 you'll become obsolete.

1005
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
你会变得过时。

1006
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 So, this particular

1006
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
那么，这个特殊的

1007
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 heading here, CODAC moment,

1007
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
前往这里，CODAC时刻，

1008
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 so in the past, there's a very well-known

1008
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
所以在过去，有一个非常知名的

1009
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 advertisement. When you want to take a

1009
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
广告。当你想采取

1010
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 photo, we call it a CODAC

1010
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
照片，我们称之为 CODAC

1011
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 moment. That means you are taking a photo.

1011
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
片刻。这意味着您正在拍照。

1012
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 So, that's why they call it a

1012
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
所以，这就是为什么他们称其为

1013
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 CODAC moment. So, anyway,

1013
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
科达克时刻。所以，无论如何，

1014
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 CODAC kind of went bankrupt

1014
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
CODAC 有点破产了

1015
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 around

1015
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
大约

1016
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 2012, which is about

1016
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
2012年，大约是

1017
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 13 years ago.

1017
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
13年前。

1018
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Alright, so the next thing we are going to

1018
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
好的，接下来我们要做的就是

1019
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 quickly do is, we are going

1019
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
快点做的是，我们要去

1020
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 to look at how do we capture

1020
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
看看我们如何捕捉

1021
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 information,

1021
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
信息，

1022
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 this image and video information

1022
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
该图像和视频信息

1023
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 from camera. So, we are going

1023
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
从相机。所以，我们要去

1024
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 to spend a bit of time to talk about

1024
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
花一点时间谈谈

1025
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 camera, how to perform

1025
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
相机，如何执行

1026
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 data acquisition.

1026
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
数据采集​​。

1027
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 Right, so in order to do that, I actually have

1027
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
是的，为了做到这一点，我实际上有

1028
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 a very short video to explain

1028
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
一个很短的视频来解释

1029
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 to you how a camera

1029
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
对你来说相机如何

1030
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 works, how does it capture

1030
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
工作原理，它如何捕获

1031
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 lights from the

1031
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
灯光从

1032
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 imaging source and convert it into

1032
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
图像源并将其转换为

1033
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 a digital image.

1033
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
数字图像。

1034
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 Right, okay. So, let

1034
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
对了，好吧。那么，让

1035
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 me just play this video for you.

1035
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
我只是为你播放这个视频。

1036
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Okay, let me just do some adjustment first. This echo is very strong here.

1036
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:42,000
好吧，我先做一些调整。这里的回声非常强烈。

1037
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 This program contains experiments which are performed by professionals. These tests are dangerous and may involve the use of hazardous materials. They should not be performed or imitated under any circumstances.

1037
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:08,000
该程序包含由专业人员进行的实验。这些测试很危险，可能涉及使用有害材料。在任何情况下都不应执行或模仿它们。

1038
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 It's all about light.

1038
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
一切都与光有关。

1039
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 The digital camera.

1039
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
数码相机。

1040
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 It's revolutionized photography

1040
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
它彻底改变了摄影

1041
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 by transforming light into

1041
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
通过将光转化为

1042
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 electricity. Everything

1042
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
电。一切

1043
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 is there to draw in light. From

1043
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
是用来画光的。从

1044
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 the camera's buttons, controls

1044
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
相机的按钮、控件

1045
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 and dials down to the lenses.

1045
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
并向下拨至镜头。

1046
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 What the digital camera

1046
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
数码相机是什么

1047
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 does with light is what makes it

1047
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
光的作用就是它的本质

1048
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 so revolutionary.

1048
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
如此革命性。

1049
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 It turns

1049
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
原来

1050
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 light into electrical charges

1050
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
光转化为电荷

1051
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 that become the image captured on the screen.

1051
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
成为屏幕上捕获的图像。

1052
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 Light particles or photons

1052
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
光粒子或光子

1053
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 leave the source, bounce

1053
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
离开源头，反弹

1054
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 off the subject and

1054
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
偏离主题和

1055
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 enter the camera through a series of

1055
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
通过一系列进入相机

1056
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 lenses.

1056
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
镜头。

1057
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 The photons then follow a designated

1057
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
然后光子遵循指定的

1058
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 path on their way from photon

1058
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
从光子出发的路径

1059
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 to photo.

1059
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
去拍照。

1060
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 A series of lenses allows the

1060
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
一系列镜头允许

1061
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 photographer to capture the clearest image

1061
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
摄影师捕捉最清晰的图像

1062
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 possible.

1062
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
可能的。

1063
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 This lens diaphragm is what

1063
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
这个镜头光圈是什么

1064
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 controls the amount of light that the photographer

1064
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
控制摄影师的光量

1065
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 allows in through the camera's opening

1065
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
允许通过相机的开口进入

1066
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 or aperture.

1066
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
或光圈。

1067
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 After crossing

1067
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
穿越后

1068
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 the diaphragm, the lenses

1068
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
光圈、镜头

1069
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 and entering the aperture,

1069
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
并进入光圈，

1070
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 the light bounces off a mirror and

1070
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
光线从镜子反射回来

1071
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 heads for the viewfinder.

1071
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
头转向取景器。

1072
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 Before it gets there, the light is flipped

1072
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
在到达那里之前，灯会翻转

1073
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 over as it passes through a prism.

1073
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
当它穿过棱镜时。

1074
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 That's so the image seen in the viewfinder is

1074
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
所以在取景器中看到的图像是

1075
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 right side up.

1075
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
右侧朝上。

1076
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 If the photographer likes the

1076
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
如果摄影师喜欢

1077
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 image, time to press the shutter

1077
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
图像，按下快门的时间

1078
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 button.

1078
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
按钮。

1079
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 The mirror lifts and the light rushes in.

1079
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
镜子升起，光线涌入。

1080
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 For a fraction of a second,

1080
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
在不到一秒的时间里，

1081
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 the light is not heading in the direction

1081
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
光线没有照着这个方向

1082
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 of the viewfinder.

1082
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
取景器的。

1083
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 But for the very heart of the digital camera,

1083
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
但对于数码相机的核心来说，

1084
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 the image sensor.

1084
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
图像传感器。

1085
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 The duration of this fraction

1085
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
该部分的持续时间

1086
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 of a second depends on the shutter

1086
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
一秒取决于快门

1087
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 that opens just long enough to

1087
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
打开足够长的时间

1088
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 expose the sensor to light.

1088
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
将传感器暴露在光线下。

1089
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Now, to the real heart of this

1089
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
现在，进入真正的核心

1090
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 digital revolution, the element

1090
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
数字革命，元素

1091
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 that captures the image,

1091
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
捕捉图像，

1092
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 the image sensor. A tightly

1092
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
图像传感器。紧紧地

1093
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 structured grid made up of

1093
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
结构化网格由

1094
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 extremely tiny light sensors.

1094
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
极其微小的光传感器。

1095
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 When the photons hit the light sensor,

1095
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
当光子撞击光传感器时，

1096
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 they are absorbed by the semiconductor

1096
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
它们被半导体吸收

1097
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 material it's made of.

1097
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
它的材质。

1098
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 For each photon absorbed,

1098
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
对于每个吸收的光子，

1099
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 the light sensor emits an electric particle

1099
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
光传感器发射出带电粒子

1100
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 called an electron.

1100
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
称为电子。

1101
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 The photon's

1101
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
光子的

1102
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 energy transfers to the electron.

1102
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
能量转移到电子。

1103
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 That's the electrical charge.

1103
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
这就是电荷。

1104
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 The brighter the image,

1104
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
图像越亮，

1105
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 the stronger the electrical charge is.

1105
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
电荷越强。

1106
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 So each electrical charge

1106
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
所以每个电荷

1107
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 has a different intensity. A circuit

1107
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
具有不同的强度。一个电路

1108
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 board then converts the different intensities

1108
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
然后板转换不同的强度

1109
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 into computer language.

1109
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
转化为计算机语言。

1110
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 They represent millions of tiny colored

1110
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
它们代表了数以百万计的小有色人种

1111
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 dots that make up a photo.

1111
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
构成照片的点。

1112
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 The pixels.

1112
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
像素。

1113
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 The more pixels

1113
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
像素越多

1114
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 in a picture, the better the

1114
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
在图片中，越好

1115
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 resolution.

1115
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
解决。

1116
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 Okay.

1116
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
好的。

1117
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 So this is a new system.

1117
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
所以这是一个新系统。

1118
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 I'm not too sure why the

1118
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
我不太确定为什么

1119
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 echo is so strong.

1119
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
回声是如此强烈。

1120
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 Yeah. Okay. So we'll try to work with it.

1120
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
是的。好的。所以我们会尝试使用它。

1121
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Okay.

1121
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
好的。

1122
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 So let's see.

1122
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
那么让我们看看。

1123
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 So this is a new system.

1123
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
所以这是一个新系统。

1124
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 So let's see.

1124
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
那么让我们看看。

1125
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 So let's see.

1125
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
那么让我们看看。

1126
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 So let's see.

1126
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
那么让我们看看。

1127
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 Okay.

1127
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
好的。

1128
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 So let's see.

1128
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
那么让我们看看。

1129
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 So let's see.

1129
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
那么让我们看看。

1130
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Okay. So we'll try to work with it

1130
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
好的。所以我们会尝试使用它

1131
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 for the time being.

1131
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
暂且。

1132
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 So this particular video just shows you

1132
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
所以这个特定的视频只是向您展示

1133
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 how we can actually,

1133
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
我们实际上如何能够

1134
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 the lights from the imaging source

1134
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
来自成像源的光

1135
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 can be converted into a particular

1135
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
可以转换成特定的

1136
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 image or video.

1136
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
图像或视频。

1137
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 It's because you have a sensor.

1137
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
这是因为你有一个传感器。

1138
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 And then for a particular sensor,

1138
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
然后对于特定的传感器，

1139
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 image sensor in the camera,

1139
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
相机中的图像传感器，

1140
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 actually it consists of many different

1140
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
实际上它由许多不同的

1141
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 elements. And these elements can actually

1141
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
元素。而这些元素实际上可以

1142
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 then convert the light or the photons

1142
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
然后转换光或光子

1143
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 into electric charges.

1143
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
转化为电荷。

1144
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 And these electric charges can then be converted

1144
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
然后这些电荷可以转换

1145
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 into some binary representation,

1145
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
转化为某种二进制表示形式，

1146
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 which is the pixels.

1146
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
这是像素。

1147
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Okay. So this particular slide shows

1147
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
好的。所以这张特别的幻灯片展示了

1148
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 the signal flows of a digital camera.

1148
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
数码相机的信号流。

1149
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 So let's have a quick look at

1149
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
让我们快速浏览一下

1150
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 how the signal flow looks like.

1150
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
信号流是什么样子的。

1151
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 So first of all, you have some subjects.

1151
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
首先，你有一些主题。

1152
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 So the light will be collected by this

1152
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
所以光线会被这个收集

1153
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 lens here. So the lens will collect the light.

1153
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
镜头在这里。所以镜头会收集光线。

1154
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 Okay. And then it will hit this particular

1154
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
好的。然后它会击中这个特定的

1155
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 CCD. So this CCD is a

1155
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
CCD。所以这个CCD是一个

1156
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 types of image sensor.

1156
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
图像传感器的类型。

1157
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 So there are a few common types of

1157
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
那么常见的有以下几种类型

1158
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 image sensor. CCD

1158
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
图像传感器。 CCD

1159
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 is one of them. Right. CMOS

1159
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
就是其中之一。正确的。互补金属氧化物半导体

1160
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 is another one. Right. So this particular

1160
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
是另一个。正确的。所以这个特殊的

1161
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 CCD here, right,

1161
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
CCD在这里，对吧，

1162
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 from the video that you see just now, this CCD

1162
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
从你刚才看到的视频来看，这个CCD

1163
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 actually has a very packed

1163
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
实际上有一个非常拥挤的

1164
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 array or matrix

1164
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
数组或矩阵

1165
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 of sensor, which will then

1165
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
传感器，然后将

1166
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 convert the light into

1166
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
将光转换成

1167
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 some electric charges.

1167
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
一些电费。

1168
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 Okay. So afterwards you have

1168
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
好的。所以之后你有

1169
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 an analog to digital converter

1169
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
模数转换器

1170
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 to convert all these electric

1170
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
将所有这些电力转换为

1171
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 charges into the pixel value.

1171
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
充入像素值。

1172
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Right. So for this pixel value,

1172
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
正确的。所以对于这个像素值，

1173
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 you can decide to, for example,

1173
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
例如，您可以决定

1174
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 store as a raw image.

1174
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
存储为原始图像。

1175
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 For those of you who play with

1175
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
对于那些玩过的人

1176
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 photography, sometimes you

1176
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
摄影，有时你

1177
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 may prefer to keep the image

1177
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
可能更喜欢保留图像

1178
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 in the raw format. Because

1178
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
以原始格式。因为

1179
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 if you keep it in the raw format, then you can

1179
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
如果你保持原始格式，那么你可以

1180
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 have access to the original data

1180
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
可以访问原始数据

1181
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 and you can do different types of

1181
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
你可以做不同类型的

1182
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 manipulation to

1182
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
操纵

1183
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 adjust the photo quality.

1183
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
调整照片质量。

1184
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 But for most people,

1184
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
但对于大多数人来说，

1185
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 we'll let the

1185
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
我们会让

1186
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 onboard processor in

1186
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
板载处理器

1187
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 the camera to do the processing.

1187
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
相机进行处理。

1188
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 So the processor, the image

1188
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
所以处理器、图像

1189
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 processing engine on the camera

1189
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
相机上的处理引擎

1190
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 will typically do the following.

1190
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
通常会执行以下操作。

1191
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 So first of all, you will do the

1191
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
所以首先，您将执行以下操作

1192
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 demossacking or the image reconstruction.

1192
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
去马赛克或图像重建。

1193
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 So you try to recover

1193
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
所以你尝试恢复

1194
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 three channels

1194
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
三个通道

1195
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 of color images.

1195
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
彩色图像。

1196
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 So this particular process is known as

1196
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
所以这个特殊的过程被称为

1197
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 reconstruction or demossacking.

1197
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
重建或拆除。

1198
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 And afterwards,

1198
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
然后，

1199
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 adjust the brightness, make sure that the

1199
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
调整亮度，确保

1200
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 image looks bright,

1200
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
图像看起来明亮，

1201
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 and then doing the white balancing.

1201
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
然后进行白平衡。

1202
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 So white balancing is that you make sure that

1202
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
所以白平衡就是你要确保

1203
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 white color, white

1203
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
白色，白色

1204
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 object will actually appear

1204
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
物体实际上会出现

1205
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 as if it's white color. Because

1205
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
就好像它是白色的一样。因为

1206
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 white color is very sensitive to

1206
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
白色对颜色非常敏感

1207
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 the light sources. When you capture an

1207
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
光源。当您捕捉到一个

1208
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 image, whether it will appear to be

1208
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
图像，是否会出现

1209
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 white or not depends on what kind of

1209
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
白色与否取决于什么样的

1210
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 light sources you are getting.

1210
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
您获得的光源。

1211
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 So this white balancing step will

1211
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
所以这个白平衡步骤将

1212
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 make sure that the white component

1212
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
确保白色成分

1213
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 will appear to be white.

1213
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
会显得是白色的。

1214
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 And afterwards, improve the sharpness,

1214
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
然后，提高锐度，

1215
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 you'll improve the contrast of the

1215
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
你会提高对比度

1216
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 image. So these are actually the

1216
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
图像。所以这些实际上是

1217
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 kind of processor,

1217
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
一种处理器，

1218
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 the onboard processing

1218
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
机载处理

1219
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 performed by the

1219
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
由执行

1220
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 camera. And afterwards,

1220
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
相机。然后，

1221
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 next you can then proceed to do the compression.

1221
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
接下来您可以继续进行压缩。

1222
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 Because typically the image, if you don't

1222
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
因为通常图像，如果你不这样做

1223
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 compress it, it's latched. So you need

1223
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
压缩它，它被锁定。所以你需要

1224
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 to perform the compression,

1224
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
执行压缩，

1225
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 but some common compression technique that you

1225
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
但您可以使用一些常见的压缩技术

1226
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 can use is, for example, the JPEG

1226
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
例如，可以使用 JPEG

1227
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 compression. Then you can compress it

1227
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
压缩。然后就可以压缩了

1228
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 and store it into your memory

1228
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
并将其存储到你的记忆中

1229
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 card. Or in some application,

1229
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
卡片。或者在某些应用中，

1230
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 for example, if you are trying to do

1230
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
例如，如果你想这样做

1231
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 some publishing application, then

1231
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
一些发布应用程序，然后

1232
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 the quality of the image is very important.

1232
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
图像的质量非常重要。

1233
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 Then you may store it uncompressed,

1233
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
然后你可以不压缩地存储它，

1234
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 for example using the TIFF format

1234
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
例如使用 TIFF 格式

1235
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 and store it into your memory card.

1235
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
并将其存储到您的存储卡中。

1236
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 So this is the typical signal flow.

1236
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
这就是典型的信号流。

1237
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 So when we want to talk

1237
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
所以当我们想说话的时候

1238
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 about a camera, what is the

1238
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
关于相机，什么是

1239
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 important criteria to determine

1239
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
确定的重要标准

1240
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 whether the quality of

1240
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
质量是否

1241
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 the camera, there's a few key factors.

1241
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
相机，有几个关键因素。

1242
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 So the first one is lens.

1242
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
所以第一个是镜头。

1243
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 This lens here.

1243
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
这个镜头在这里。

1244
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 So when you buy

1244
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
所以当你购买时

1245
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 a camera, for those of you who are into

1245
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
一台相机，对于那些喜欢

1246
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 photography, you'll know

1246
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
摄影，你就会知道

1247
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 that lens is very important and

1247
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
这个镜头非常重要并且

1248
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 it's very expensive.

1248
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
它非常昂贵。

1249
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 The role of the lens is that it's trying to

1249
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
镜头的作用是它试图

1250
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 collect the light from the

1250
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
收集来自的光

1251
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 imaging source. So therefore, whether a

1251
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
成像源。因此，无论是

1252
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 camera is good or not, the quality

1252
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
相机好不好，质量

1253
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 of the lens is a very important factor.

1253
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
镜头的材质是一个非常重要的因素。

1254
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 So the next one is CCD.

1254
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
那么下一个就是CCD。

1255
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 This particular part here, the sensor.

1255
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
这里的这个特殊部分是传感器。

1256
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 So this particular

1256
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
所以这个特殊的

1257
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 sensor, typically, if

1257
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
传感器，通常，如果

1258
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 the sensor has a higher resolution,

1258
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
传感器具有更高的分辨率，

1259
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 we consider it to be better.

1259
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
我们认为这样更好。

1260
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 For example, 10 megapixel

1260
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
例如，10兆像素

1261
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 sensor, usually we consider

1261
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
传感器，通常我们考虑

1262
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 it to be better than, for example, 3 megapixel

1262
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
例如，它比 3 兆像素更好

1263
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 sensor. But more

1263
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
传感器。但更多的是

1264
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 importantly is whether this sensor

1264
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
重要的是这个传感器是否

1265
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 is very sensitive to noise or not.

1265
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
对噪音与否非常敏感。

1266
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 When you take the photo, for example, in a

1266
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
例如，当您在

1267
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 very dark environment,

1267
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
非常黑暗的环境，

1268
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 whether the sensor is very sensitive to

1268
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
传感器是否非常敏感

1269
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 noise. So the quality of

1269
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
噪音。所以质量

1270
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 the sensor therefore is also an important factor.

1270
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
因此传感器也是一个重要因素。

1271
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 And then finally

1271
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
然后最后

1272
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 is this particular image processing engine

1272
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
是这个特定的图像处理引擎吗

1273
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 here. How well

1273
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
这里。怎么样？

1274
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 the

1274
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
这

1275
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 camera performs all these tasks here.

1275
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
相机在这里执行所有这些任务。

1276
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 So depending on different companies, for example,

1276
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
所以根据不同的公司，例如，

1277
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 whether you are

1277
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
无论你是

1278
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 Canon or whether you are Nikson,

1278
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
无论你是佳能还是尼克森，

1279
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 so different companies

1279
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
所以不同的公司

1280
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 have their own algorithm

1280
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
有自己的算法

1281
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 to perform these tasks here. So

1281
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
在这里执行这些任务。所以

1282
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 they are a little bit different. So that the

1282
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
他们有点不同。从而使

1283
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 performance of this particular image

1283
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
这个特定图像的表现

1284
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 processing engine will also determine

1284
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
处理引擎还将确定

1285
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 the quality of your camera and

1285
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
你的相机的质量和

1286
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 the captured images of video.

1286
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
捕获的视频图像。

1287
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 So therefore the digital image quality is

1287
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
因此数字图像质量为

1288
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 actually determined by these

1288
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
实际上是由这些决定的

1289
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 three factors here, which is shown.

1289
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
这里显示了三个因素。

1290
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 So it depends on the lens performance,

1290
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
所以这取决于镜头性能，

1291
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 CCD, image sensor,

1291
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
CCD、图像传感器、

1292
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 pixel count and performance, as

1292
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
像素数和性能，如

1293
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 well as the image processing

1293
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
以及图像处理

1294
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 engine performance. So these are

1294
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
发动机性能。所以这些是

1295
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 the factors that will determine

1295
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
决定因素

1296
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 the quality of the image.

1296
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
图像的质量。

1297
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 Right, so what are the

1297
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
对了，那么有哪些

1298
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 some common cameras?

1298
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
一些常见的相机？

1299
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 So this particular slide

1299
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
所以这张特别的幻灯片

1300
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 shows some of the common

1300
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
显示了一些常见的

1301
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 cameras that are available out there.

1301
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
那里有可用的相机。

1302
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 So the one that we have seen just now is

1302
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
所以我们刚才看到的就是

1303
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 the normal RGB kind of

1303
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
正常的 RGB 类型

1304
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 cameras. But in addition to that,

1304
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
相机。但除此之外，

1305
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 there are many other different cameras that are

1305
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
还有许多其他不同的相机

1306
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 out there. For example, one of the

1306
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
在那里。例如，其中之一

1307
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 other common cameras

1307
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
其他常见相机

1308
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 that we have is the RGBD.

1308
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
我们拥有的是 RGBD。

1309
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 So RGBD camera,

1309
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
所以RGBD相机，

1310
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 for example this Kinect camera.

1310
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
例如这个 Kinect 相机。

1311
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 So in addition to the RGB

1311
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
所以除了RGB

1312
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 information, it can also capture

1312
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
信息，它还可以捕获

1313
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 the depth information.

1313
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
深度信息。

1314
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 It can also capture the depth information.

1314
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
它还可以捕获深度信息。

1315
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 Another common

1315
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
另一种常见的

1316
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 types of camera that we have is

1316
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
我们拥有的相机类型是

1317
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 the near-infrared.

1317
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
近红外线。

1318
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 This type of cameras here.

1318
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
这里有这种类型的相机。

1319
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 Another common one is

1319
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
另一种常见的就是

1320
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 the thermal camera. For example,

1320
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
热像仪。例如，

1321
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 when you, during the

1321
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
当你在期间

1322
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 many years ago,

1322
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
许多年前，

1323
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 during the SARS period, I'm not sure

1323
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
SARS期间，我不确定

1324
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 whether you heard about SARS.

1324
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
你是否听说过SARS。

1325
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 Do you know about SARS?

1325
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
你了解非典吗？

1326
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 Okay, SARS, I think

1326
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
好吧，我认为是SARS

1327
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 occurred around

1327
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
发生在周围

1328
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 2003, around that time.

1328
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
2003年，大约在那个时候。

1329
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 And afterwards, the most recent one

1329
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
然后是最近的一张

1330
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 of us is COVID. So for those

1330
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
我们中的一些人是新冠病毒。所以对于那些

1331
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 you can use, for example, this kind of

1331
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
例如，你可以使用这种

1332
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 thermal camera to detect

1332
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
热像仪检测

1333
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 the body temperature. So it's

1333
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
体温。所以这是

1334
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 types of camera as well.

1334
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
相机的类型也是如此。

1335
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 And then another types of camera that we

1335
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
然后我们使用另一种类型的相机

1336
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 have is event-based camera.

1336
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
有一个基于事件的相机。

1337
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 So event-based camera

1337
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
所以基于事件的相机

1338
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 means that only when there's a change

1338
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
意味着只有当发生变化时

1339
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 of the brightness,

1339
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
的亮度，

1340
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 okay, of

1340
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
好的，的

1341
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 the imaging scene,

1341
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
成像场景，

1342
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 then it will be able, it will capture

1342
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
那么它将能够，它将捕获

1343
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 the information. So most of the time

1343
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
的信息。所以大多数时候

1344
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 it will not capture the information.

1344
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
它不会捕获信息。

1345
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 But when there's change of brightness, then it will

1345
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
但是当亮度发生变化时，就会

1346
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 capture. So the reason why

1346
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
捕获。所以原因是

1347
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 event-based camera is used in some

1347
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
基于事件的相机被用于一些

1348
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 applications is because it's

1348
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
应用程序是因为它是

1349
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 very power

1349
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
非常有力量

1350
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 efficient. Yeah, it can save

1350
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
高效的。是的，可以节省

1351
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 lots of energy. So therefore you can see

1351
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
大量的能量。所以你可以看到

1352
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 there's many different types of camera

1352
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
有许多不同类型的相机

1353
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 that can be used in different kind

1353
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
可以用于不同种类

1354
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 of application.

1354
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
的应用程序。

1355
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 Yeah.

1355
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
是的。

1356
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 Okay, so

1356
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
好吧，那么

1357
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 we have very briefly explained

1357
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
我们已经非常简要地解释了

1358
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 about image already. So next,

1358
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
关于图像已经。那么接下来，

1359
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 let's move on to video. So what's

1359
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
让我们继续观看视频。那么什么是

1360
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 video? Video is nothing but a sequence

1360
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
视频？视频只不过是一个序列

1361
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 of frame or images

1361
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
帧或图像的

1362
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 or pictures with audio

1362
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
或带声音的图片

1363
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 signal. So essentially all of us

1363
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
信号。所以基本上我们所有人

1364
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 should know that video is nothing but a

1364
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
要知道视频只不过是

1365
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 sequence of frame.

1365
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
帧的序列。

1366
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 Okay, and when you play this sequence

1366
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
好的，当你播放这个序列时

1367
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 of frame very quickly, and

1367
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
帧的速度非常快，并且

1368
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 due to the human persistence

1368
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
由于人类的坚持

1369
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 of vision, then you start to get the

1369
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
的愿景，然后你开始得到

1370
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 impression of smooth movement.

1370
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
流畅运动的印象。

1371
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 So that's essentially what a video

1371
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
这就是视频的本质

1372
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 is. Okay, and it also

1372
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
是。好吧，还有它

1373
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 has the audio component.

1373
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
有音频组件。

1374
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 So the different frame that we have, sometimes

1374
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
所以有时我们有不同的框架

1375
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 we call it frame, sometimes we call it

1375
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
我们称之为框架，有时我们称之为

1376
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 images, sometimes we call it pictures,

1376
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
图像，有时我们称之为图片，

1377
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 they refer to the same thing.

1377
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
他们指的是同一件事。

1378
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 Right, so as mentioned earlier on, we

1378
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
是的，正如前面提到的，我们

1379
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 play this video at a very high speed

1379
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
以非常高的速度播放该视频

1380
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 that gives the impression of the

1380
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
给人的印象是

1381
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 movement, a very smooth movement.

1381
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
运动，非常流畅的运动。

1382
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 Okay, due to the human persistence

1382
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
好吧，由于人类的坚持

1383
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 of vision. So this is the characteristics

1383
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
的视觉。所以这就是特点

1384
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 of the human vision system.

1384
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
人类视觉系统。

1385
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 So some popular video format

1385
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
那么一些流行的视频格式

1386
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 include MPAC, Moving Picture

1386
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
包括 MPAC、动态图片

1387
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Expert Group,

1387
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
专家组，

1388
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 AVI, which is Intel, and then

1388
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
AVI，也就是英特尔，然后

1389
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 WMV, which is Microsoft.

1389
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
WMV，即微软。

1390
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 So this is some of the

1390
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
所以这是一些

1391
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 common video format.

1391
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
常见的视频格式。

1392
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 So next I will play you

1392
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
那么接下来我就来玩你

1393
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 a short video so I couldn't resist

1393
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
一个短视频让我无法抗拒

1394
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 because we are talking about video. So I

1394
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
因为我们正在谈论视频。所以我

1395
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 will just play you a video of one of my

1395
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
只会给你播放我的一个视频

1396
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 popular songs.

1396
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
流行歌曲。

1397
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 So

1397
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
所以

1398
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 yeah, so bear with me.

1398
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
是的，所以请耐心听我说。

1399
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 So this particular song is actually

1399
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
所以这首歌实际上是

1400
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 an example of a video.

1400
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
视频示例。

1401
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 So

1401
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
所以

1402
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 So

1402
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
所以

1403
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 So

1403
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
所以

1404
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 So

1404
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
所以

1405
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 So

1405
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
所以

1406
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
 So

1406
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
所以

1407
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 So

1407
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
所以

1408
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 So

1408
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
所以

1409
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 So

1409
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
所以

1410
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 So

1410
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
所以

1411
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 So

1411
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
所以

1412
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 So

1412
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
所以

1413
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 So

1413
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
所以

1414
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 So

1414
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
所以

1415
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 So

1415
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
所以

1416
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 So

1416
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
所以

1417
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 So

1417
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
所以

1418
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 So

1418
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
所以

1419
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 So

1419
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
所以

1420
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 So

1420
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
所以

1421
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,020
 So

1421
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,020
所以

1422
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,020
 So

1422
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,020
所以

1423
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,020
 So

1423
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,020
所以

1424
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,020
 So

1424
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,020
所以

1425
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,020
 So

1425
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,020
所以

1426
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,020
 So

1426
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,020
所以

1427
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,020
 So

1427
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,020
所以

1428
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,020
 So

1428
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,020
所以

1429
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,020
 So

1429
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,020
所以

1430
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,020
 So

1430
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,020
所以

1431
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,020
 So

1431
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,020
所以

1432
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,020
 So

1432
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,020
所以

1433
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,020
 So

1433
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,020
所以

1434
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:36,020
 Ah, someday, someone will take this road

1434
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:36,020
啊，总有一天，有人会走这条路

1435
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:47,020
 I will go, with my face turned to blue

1435
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:47,020
我会走，脸色发青

1436
00:55:47,020 --> 00:56:11,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1436
00:55:47,020 --> 00:56:11,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1437
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:24,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1437
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:24,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1438
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:52,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1438
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:52,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1439
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:57,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1439
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:57,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1440
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:02,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1440
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:02,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1441
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:07,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1441
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:07,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1442
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:12,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1442
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:12,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1443
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:17,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1443
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:17,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1444
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:47,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1444
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:47,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1445
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:17,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1445
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:17,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1446
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:47,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1446
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:47,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1447
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:17,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1447
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:17,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1448
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:47,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1448
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:47,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1449
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:17,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1449
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:17,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1450
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:47,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1450
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:47,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1451
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:17,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1451
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:17,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1452
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:47,020
 I will go, farewell, I will be closed

1452
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:47,020
我要走了，再见，我要关门了

1453
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,020
 So these are known as 480i

1453
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,020
所以这些被称为 480i

1454
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,020
 And this particular i refers to interlace scanning

1454
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,020
这个特定的 i 指的是隔行扫描

1455
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,020
 That we will explain a bit later here

1455
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,020
我们稍后会在这里解释

1456
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:25,020
 And then for the PEL, for example, it says that it's 576i

1456
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:25,020
然后对于 PEL，例如，它说它是 576i

1457
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:30,020
 That means the number of rows is 720

1457
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:30,020
这意味着行数是 720

1458
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:38,020
 The width is 720 and the height of the number of rows is 576 here

1458
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:38,020
这里的宽度是720，行数的高度是576

1459
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,020
 So therefore this number actually indicates the resolution

1459
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,020
因此这个数字实际上表示分辨率

1460
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:44,020
 So the standard resolution is used in very early years

1460
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:44,020
所以很早的时候就使用标准分辨率

1461
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:48,020
 That's why you can see the resolution actually is very small

1461
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:48,020
这就是为什么你可以看到分辨率实际上非常小

1462
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:52,020
 And then afterwards we moved on to the high definition

1462
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:52,020
然后我们转向高清

1463
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:55,020
 High definition is called HD

1463
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:55,020
高清晰度称为HD

1464
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:58,020
 So under HD there's a few different variations

1464
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:58,020
所以在高清下有一些不同的变化

1465
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,020
 The first one is 720p

1465
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,020
第一个是720p的

1466
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:05,020
 So 720p refers to, this number here usually refers to the number of rows

1466
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:05,020
所以720p指的是，这里的这个数字通常指的是行数

1467
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:13,020
 So 720p means 1280 by 720

1467
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:13,020
所以 720p 意味着 1280 x 720

1468
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:16,020
 And this p here refers to progressive

1468
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:16,020
而这里的p指的是渐进式

1469
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:21,020
 Later on we'll see what's the difference between interlace and progressive

1469
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:21,020
稍后我们将了解隔行扫描和逐行扫描之间的区别

1470
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:24,020
 So the next one is 1080i

1470
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:24,020
所以下一个是1080i

1471
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:31,020
 So 1080i refers to 1920 by 1080

1471
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:31,020
所以1080i指的是1920乘1080

1472
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,020
 And then i refers to interlace

1472
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,020
然后我指的是交错

1473
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:37,020
 And then finally 1080p is this resolution

1473
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:37,020
最后1080p就是这个分辨率

1474
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,020
 And p is progressive

1474
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,020
并且 p 是渐进的

1475
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:44,020
 So when you have this 1080p it also has a very unique name known as a full HD

1475
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:44,020
因此，当您拥有 1080p 时，它还有一个非常独特的名称，即全高清

1476
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:53,020
 So maybe 10, 15 years ago when your parents go out and buy a TV from an electronic shop

1476
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:53,020
所以也许 10、15 年前，当你的父母出去从电子商店购买电视时

1477
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:58,020
 And on the shop you see this full HD

1477
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:58,020
在商店里你可以看到这个全高清

1478
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:02,020
 Actually it refers to this particular resolution with this scanning

1478
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:02,020
实际上它指的是这种扫描的特定分辨率

1479
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:09,020
 And of course in recent years nowadays the TV that we have is the ultra high definition or UHD here

1479
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:09,020
当然，近年来我们拥有的电视是超高清或UHD

1480
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:13,020
 So we typically see things like 4K or 8K

1480
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:13,020
所以我们通常会看到 4K 或 8K 之类的东西

1481
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:18,020
 So 4K resolution is about four times the size of a full HD

1481
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:18,020
因此 4K 分辨率大约是全高清尺寸的四倍

1482
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:22,020
 And the 8K resolution is four times the resolution of 4K

1482
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:22,020
并且8K分辨率是4K分辨率的四倍

1483
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:28,020
 So all this number if you look at it, you may not have a good intuition of how it looks like

1483
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:28,020
因此，如果您查看所有这些数字，您可能对它的样子没有很好的直觉

1484
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:32,020
 So if you look at this particular image it gives you an impression

1484
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:32,020
所以如果你看这张特定的图片，它会给你一个印象

1485
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:39,020
 About how over time the number of pixels that you can squeeze into a single frame, how it has progressed

1485
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:39,020
关于随着时间的推移，可以压缩到单个帧中的像素数量，它是如何进步的

1486
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:43,020
 So we start off with this SD and afterwards HD

1486
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:43,020
所以我们从标清开始，然后是高清

1487
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:49,020
 4K, so most of our TV nowadays is using this 4K resolution

1487
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:49,020
4K，所以现在我们大部分的电视都使用这个4K分辨率

1488
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:52,020
 And then 8K resolution is about this big

1488
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:52,020
然后8K分辨率大约有这么大

1489
01:04:52,020 --> 01:05:03,020
 So in the previous slide we introduced these terms about interlace scanning, I, and the progressive scanning, P

1489
01:04:52,020 --> 01:05:03,020
因此，在上一张幻灯片中，我们介绍了有关隔行扫描 I 和逐行扫描 P 的术语

1490
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:06,020
 So what's the difference between these two types of scan type?

1490
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:06,020
那么这两种扫描类型有什么区别呢？

1491
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:14,020
 So interlace scanning refers to, given a particular, for example, image frame, if it's a video

1491
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:14,020
因此，隔行扫描是指给定特定的图像帧（例如，如果它是视频）

1492
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:20,020
 So first of all we scan the odd line first and afterwards we scan the even line

1492
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:20,020
所以首先我们先扫描奇数行，然后扫描偶数行

1493
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:25,020
 So sometimes we also call it top or bottom field

1493
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:25,020
所以有时我们也称其为顶场或底场

1494
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:28,020
 So we scan the top field first, followed by the bottom field

1494
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:28,020
所以我们首先扫描顶部字段，然后扫描底部字段

1495
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:34,020
 So if you do that, then this kind of scanning is known as interlace scanning

1495
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:34,020
所以如果你这样做，那么这种扫描就称为隔行扫描

1496
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:40,020
 So it consists of two fields, odd or even line, or sometimes it's known as top and bottom field

1496
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:40,020
因此它由两个场组成，奇数行或偶数行，或者有时称为顶场和底场

1497
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,020
 So it's scanned alternately

1497
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,020
所以交替扫描

1498
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,020
 So this is an example of the interlace scanning

1498
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,020
这是隔行扫描的一个例子

1499
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:50,020
 You can see it scans the odd line first, the blue line

1499
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:50,020
你可以看到它首先扫描奇数行，蓝线

1500
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:54,020
 And afterwards it scans the red line here

1500
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:54,020
然后它扫描这里的红线

1501
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:56,020
 So this is the interlace scanning

1501
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:56,020
这就是隔行扫描

1502
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:00,020
 So as opposed to that, you have the next one which is the progressive scanning

1502
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:00,020
与此相反，下一个是逐行扫描

1503
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:06,020
 So the progressive scanning is all the lines are scanned in sequence, so you scan it line by line

1503
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:06,020
所以逐行扫描就是所有的行都是按顺序扫描的，所以你一行一行的扫描

1504
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:14,020
 So if you spare one moment to think about it, why do we want to do this interlace scan?

1504
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:14,020
那么，如果您抽出一点时间思考一下，我们为什么要进行隔行扫描呢？

1505
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:19,020
 Why do we want to do interlace scanning? Especially in the early years

1505
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:19,020
为什么我们要进行隔行扫描？尤其是早年

1506
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:27,020
 A lot of these standards were developed in the early years of video compression and transmission

1506
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:27,020
其中许多标准是在视频压缩和传输的早期制定的

1507
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:32,020
 So for example, interlace scanning was developed during the time

1507
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:32,020
例如，隔行扫描是在当时开发的

1508
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:36,020
 So why do you want to do interlace scanning?

1508
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:36,020
那么为什么要进行隔行扫描呢？

1509
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,020
 Anyone?

1509
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,020
有人吗？

1510
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:00,020
 So if you think about it, the reason why we want to do this interlace scanning

1510
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:00,020
所以如果你想一想，我们为什么要进行隔行扫描

1511
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:05,020
 Is that each time when you're doing interlace scanning, we only scan half of the line

1511
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:05,020
是不是每次你进行隔行扫描时，我们只扫描一半行

1512
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:11,020
 For example, we only scan the odd line for one frame, and afterwards we scan the even line

1512
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:11,020
例如，我们只扫描奇数行一帧，然后扫描偶数行

1513
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:16,020
 So therefore what it means is that when you only scan the odd line and you transmit it

1513
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:16,020
因此，这意味着当您只扫描奇数行并传输它时

1514
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:19,020
 The bandwidth that you use is only half

1514
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:19,020
您使用的带宽只有一半

1515
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:25,020
 Because during the early days, bandwidth is very limited, it's very expensive

1515
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:25,020
因为在早期，带宽非常有限，而且非常昂贵

1516
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:30,020
 So if you can reduce the number of bits that can be transmitted, you try to do that

1516
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:30,020
因此，如果您可以减少可以传输的位数，您可以尝试这样做

1517
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:34,020
 So therefore people think of one way is that you only scan the top line first

1517
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:34,020
因此人们想到一种方法就是先扫描顶行

1518
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:37,020
 And you transmit this particular frame

1518
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:37,020
然后你传输这个特定的帧

1519
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:39,020
 So the bandwidth is reduced by half

1519
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:39,020
所以带宽减少了一半

1520
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:42,020
 But there's also problems that you have

1520
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:42,020
但也有你遇到的问题

1521
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:47,020
 So when you do that, as you can see, since you're only scanning half of the line

1521
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:47,020
所以当你这样做时，正如你所看到的，因为你只扫描了一半的线

1522
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:50,020
 You're a little bit like cheating or cutting the corner

1522
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:50,020
你有点像作弊或偷工减料

1523
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:55,020
 Because it's trying to trick our eye into trying to refresh

1523
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:55,020
因为它试图欺骗我们的眼睛试图刷新

1524
01:07:55,020 --> 01:08:01,020
 So even though there's some movement, it will trick your eye to interpret

1524
01:07:55,020 --> 01:08:01,020
所以即使有一些运动，它也会欺骗你的眼睛去解读

1525
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:04,020
 This frame has been refreshed already, there's a certain movement

1525
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:04,020
这个帧已经刷新了，有一定的动静

1526
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,020
 So that is actually the trick

1526
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,020
这实际上就是诀窍

1527
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:11,020
 The objective of interlace scanning is you reduce the number of lines

1527
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:11,020
隔行扫描的目的是减少行数

1528
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,020
 And hence you reduce the bandwidth that you need to retransmit

1528
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,020
因此，您可以减少重新传输所需的带宽

1529
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:21,020
 By trying to trick our brain into thinking that it's already updated some of the content

1529
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:21,020
通过试图欺骗我们的大脑认为它已经更新了一些内容

1530
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:25,020
 But the problem of this kind of interlace scanning is that for some images

1530
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:25,020
但这种隔行扫描的问题是，对于某些图像

1531
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:31,020
 Especially lines like this, when you have some imaging scene that has lots of edges and lines

1531
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:31,020
尤其是像这样的线条，当您的成像场景有很多边缘和线条时

1532
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,020
 Some parts of the line are updated, other lines are not updated

1532
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,020
部分线路更新，其他线路未更新

1533
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:39,020
 Then you are going to get this kind of jittering effect

1533
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:39,020
然后你就会得到这种抖动的效果

1534
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,020
 So these are the jittering effects

1534
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,020
这些就是抖动效果

1535
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:46,020
 So therefore, if you're using interlace scanning, the advantage is that you reduce the bandwidth

1535
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:46,020
因此，如果您使用隔行扫描，优点是可以减少带宽

1536
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:51,020
 But the price you have to pay is that sometimes you'll get some content jittering

1536
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:51,020
但你必须付出的代价是有时你会看到一些内容抖动

1537
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:55,020
 Like this, this is a very well-known example of jittering

1537
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:55,020
像这样，这是一个非常著名的抖动例子

1538
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:59,020
 So as opposed to that, you can use this progressive scanning

1538
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:59,020
因此，与此相反，您可以使用这种逐行扫描

1539
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,020
 You scan all the lines

1539
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,020
你扫描所有的行

1540
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:08,020
 So the price you pay is that you transmit more bandwidth, but the quality is better

1540
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:08,020
所以你付出的代价是传输更多的带宽，但质量更好

1541
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:10,020
 So that is during the early days

1541
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:10,020
所以那是在早期

1542
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:14,020
 But nowadays because the bandwidth has actually increased a lot

1542
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:14,020
但现在因为带宽实际上增加了很多

1543
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,020
 And the compression technique has improved a lot

1543
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,020
而且压缩技术也进步了很多

1544
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:20,020
 So therefore nowadays we hardly use this interlace scanning anymore

1544
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:20,020
所以现在我们几乎不再使用这种隔行扫描了

1545
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:23,020
 Most of them will be based on progressive scanning

1545
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:23,020
其中大多数将基于逐行扫描

1546
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:29,020
 So earlier on we also mentioned about frame rate

1546
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:29,020
所以前面我们也提到了帧率

1547
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:32,020
 So frame rate is referred to how many frames is played per second

1547
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:32,020
所以帧率是指每秒播放多少帧

1548
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:35,020
 So it's given in terms of frames per second here

1548
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:35,020
所以这里以每秒帧数给出

1549
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:37,020
 So depending on different countries and different standards

1549
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:37,020
所以取决于不同的国家和不同的标准

1550
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:42,020
 For example, in Singapore and Australia, we use the PALS system

1550
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:42,020
例如，在新加坡和澳大利亚，我们使用PALS系统

1551
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:46,020
 Which is the video is played at 25 frames per second

1551
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:46,020
视频以每秒 25 帧的速度播放

1552
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:51,020
 And in the US and Japan, they use the NTSC standard

1552
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:51,020
在美国和日本，他们使用 NTSC 标准

1553
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,020
 So the video is played at 30 frames per second

1553
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,020
所以视频以每秒30帧的速度播放

1554
01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:03,020
 So next we are going to very quickly look at some video signal processing and application

1554
01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:03,020
接下来我们将快速了解一些视频信号处理和应用

1555
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:06,020
 So what is video signal processing?

1555
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:06,020
那么什么是视频信号处理呢？

1556
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:08,020
 So this is a very broad term as I mentioned

1556
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:08,020
所以正如我提到的，这是一个非常广泛的术语

1557
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:12,020
 So video signal processing can deal with different aspects of video

1557
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:12,020
所以视频信号处理可以处理视频的不同方面

1558
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:14,020
 So it can include things like representation

1558
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:14,020
所以它可以包括诸如代表性之类的东西

1559
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:17,020
 So how do you present the video?

1559
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:17,020
那么如何呈现视频呢？

1560
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:25,020
 Compression, how do you compress it into a small file size or low bit rate?

1560
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:25,020
压缩，如何将其压缩成小文件或低比特率？

1561
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,020
 And afterwards, how do you store it?

1561
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,020
然后，你如何存储它？

1562
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,020
 How do you transmit it?

1562
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,020
你如何传输它？

1563
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,020
 How do you process it?

1563
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,020
你如何处理它？

1564
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:35,020
 Analyze the content and understand what the content is

1564
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:35,020
分析内容并了解内容是什么

1565
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:38,020
 So there's actually many different aspects of video

1565
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:38,020
所以视频实际上有很多不同的方面

1566
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:42,020
 But for this particular course, we'll be focusing on these two topics

1566
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:42,020
但对于这个特定的课程，我们将重点关注这两个主题

1567
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:44,020
 That I mentioned a few times already

1567
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:44,020
我已经提到过几次了

1568
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:46,020
 So we'll be focusing on compression

1568
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:46,020
所以我们将重点关注压缩

1569
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:50,020
 And then we'll be focusing on analytics and understanding

1569
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:50,020
然后我们将专注于分析和理解

1570
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:56,020
 So next let's look at some of the sample signal processing applications

1570
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:56,020
接下来让我们看看一些示例信号处理应用程序

1571
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:00,020
 So there are many, many different applications nowadays that are centered on video

1571
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:00,020
所以现在有很多很多不同的以视频为中心的应用程序

1572
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:05,020
 So for example, we can have a business streaming e-commerce

1572
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:05,020
例如，我们可以拥有一个流媒体电子商务业务

1573
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:08,020
 This is particularly popular in China

1573
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:08,020
这在中国特别受欢迎

1574
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:10,020
 Almost every year

1574
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:10,020
几乎每年

1575
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,020
 Very, very popular in China

1575
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,020
在中国非常非常受欢迎

1576
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:15,020
 And then entertainment, for example, video streaming, video on demand

1576
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:15,020
然后是娱乐，例如视频流、视频点播

1577
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,020
 Some typical examples would be Netflix

1577
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,020
一些典型的例子是 Netflix

1578
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:23,020
 Any movie that you want to watch, you can just stream it

1578
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:23,020
任何你想看的电影，都可以直接观看

1579
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:27,020
 Technology, technology enabled learning online lecture

1579
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:27,020
技术，技术使学习在线讲座

1580
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:30,020
 So a few years back during COVID, it was quite serious

1580
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:30,020
几年前的新冠疫情期间，情况相当严重

1581
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:35,020
 So we have to actually conduct most of our lectures online

1581
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:35,020
所以我们实际上必须在网上进行大部分讲座

1582
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:41,020
 So other things like, for example, in smart cities transportation

1582
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:41,020
所以其他事情，例如在智慧城市交通中

1583
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:45,020
 The autonomous vehicles that you have

1583
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:45,020
您拥有的自动驾驶汽车

1584
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,020
 The video analytics

1584
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,020
视频分析

1585
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:50,020
 So for example, the autonomous vehicles

1585
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:50,020
例如，自动驾驶汽车

1586
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:54,020
 I just read, I think a few weeks ago or last month in Wuhan

1586
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:54,020
我刚刚读到，我想是几周前或上个月在武汉

1587
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:57,020
 There's actually a new service, right?

1587
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:57,020
实际上有一项新服务，对吗？

1588
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:00,020
 It's a Luo Bo Kuai Pao

1588
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:00,020
这是萝卜快炮

1589
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:05,020
 So for those applications, you need to be able to see the surroundings

1589
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:05,020
因此对于这些应用程序，您需要能够看到周围的环境

1590
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:10,020
 And be able to perform tasks like segmentation, detection and so on

1590
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:10,020
并能够执行分割、检测等任务

1591
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,020
 Okay, so next I'm just going to

1591
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,020
好的，接下来我要

1592
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:18,020
 I think for Chinese students definitely you know what this

1592
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:18,020
我想对于中国学生来说你肯定知道这是什么

1593
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,020
 直播代货

1593
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,020
直播代货

1594
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:23,020
 So I'm just going to, I'm not going to do that here

1594
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:23,020
所以我只是要，我不会在这里这样做

1595
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:26,020
 Even though I'm tempted to show my QR code

1595
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:26,020
尽管我很想出示我的二维码

1596
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:28,020
 And then you can also use some

1596
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:28,020
然后你还可以使用一些

1597
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,020
 火箭,大炮 or whatever

1597
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,020
火箭、大炮或者其他什么

1598
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:32,020
 But okay, I'm not doing here

1598
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:32,020
但好吧，我不在这里做

1599
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:39,020
 I'm just trying to show you some of the possible applications of video processing

1599
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:39,020
我只是想向您展示视频处理的一些可能的应用

1600
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:43,020
 So this is live streaming in China

1600
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:43,020
这就是中国的直播

1601
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:46,020
 Okay, so I'll just play a short segment of it

1601
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:46,020
好的，那我就播放一小段

1602
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:49,020
 Because the video is a bit long, so I'll just play a short segment

1602
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:49,020
由于视频有点长，所以只播放一小段

1603
01:12:56,020 --> 01:13:01,020
 直播代货

1603
01:12:56,020 --> 01:13:01,020
直播代货

1604
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:05,020
 Sorry, because I don't pay for the Google subscription

1604
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:05,020
抱歉，因为我不支付 Google 订阅费用

1605
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,020
 So they always show me the advertisement

1605
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,020
所以他们总是给我看广告

1606
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,020
 This is live stream shopping

1606
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,020
这是直播购物

1607
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:17,020
 One of the hottest trends in China

1607
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:17,020
中国最热门的趋势之一

1608
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:21,020
 Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows

1608
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:21,020
每晚都有千万人观看直播

1609
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:25,020
 Hosted by influencers like VIA and by the products they recommend

1609
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:25,020
由 VIA 等有影响力的人士及其推荐的产品主办

1610
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:29,020
 Or on e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Douyin

1610
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:29,020
或者在淘宝和抖音等电子商务和社交应用上

1611
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,020
 The sister app of TikTok

1611
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,020
TikTok的姊妹应用

1612
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,020
 It's not about only shopping

1612
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,020
这不仅仅是购物

1613
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,020
 It's about the experience, it's about having fun

1613
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,020
重要的是体验，重要的是享受

1614
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:50,020
 You got to see 3D, you got to see in some kind of action

1614
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:50,020
你必须看到 3D，你必须看到某种动作

1615
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,020
 It's almost like a theatre act

1615
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,020
这几乎就像一场戏剧表演

1616
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:55,020
 The internet craze has taken over China

1616
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:55,020
互联网热潮席卷中国

1617
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:01,020
 By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users

1617
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:01,020
截至2020年底，全国直播购物用户规模近4亿

1618
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:06,020
 China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically

1618
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:06,020
中国直播电商市场也大幅增长

1619
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:12,020
 With an estimated value of 161 billion dollars in 2020

1619
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:12,020
2020年预计价值1610亿美元

1620
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:15,020
 It's becoming popular outside China as well

1620
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:15,020
在中国以外也开始流行

1621
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:19,020
 So is live streaming the future of shopping?

1621
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:19,020
那么直播是购物的未来吗？

1622
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:26,020
 Live streaming is not a new thing

1622
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:26,020
直播并不是什么新鲜事

1623
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:31,020
 In China, it started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G

1623
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:31,020
在中国，从 2015 年 4G 的推出开始

1624
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:35,020
 And it was first used for entertainment and socializing

1624
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:35,020
它最初是用于娱乐和社交

1625
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:39,020
 Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them

1625
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:39,020
许多直播主播为他们的粉丝表演或与他们聊天

1626
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:43,020
 Making money by receiving virtual currency and gifts

1626
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:43,020
通过接收虚拟货币和礼物来赚钱

1627
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,020
 In the West, live streaming is mainly the doming of avid gamers

1627
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,020
在西方，直播主要是狂热游戏玩家的统治

1628
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:50,020
 In China, it's broken into e-commerce

1628
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:50,020
在中国，它进军电子商务

1629
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,020
 China actually has a very big e-commerce empire

1629
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,020
中国实际上有一个非常大的电子商务帝国

1630
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:57,020
 So it uses these super apps, what we call

1630
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:57,020
所以它使用了这些超级应用程序，我们称之为

1631
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:00,020
 That you have payment, you have search of information

1631
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:00,020
你有付款，你有信息搜索

1632
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:02,020
 You have recommendation system

1632
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:02,020
你有推荐系统

1633
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:06,020
 And you have huge amount of goods available on the platform

1633
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:06,020
并且平台上有大量商品可供选择

1634
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:08,020
 And as well as a lot of consumers

1634
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:08,020
还有很多消费者

1635
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:13,020
 So with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming

1635
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:13,020
所以利用这个优势，他们融合了直播的这些特点

1636
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:16,020
 To make the influencers actually sell goods

1636
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:16,020
让网红真正卖货

1637
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,020
 Here is a perfect choice

1637
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,020
这里是一个完美的选择

1638
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:20,020
 Nice neutrals, beautiful prints, nothing overwhelming

1638
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:20,020
漂亮的中性色，漂亮的印花，没有什么压倒性的

1639
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:22,020
 And the warmth and comfort of flannel

1639
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:22,020
还有法兰绒的温暖和舒适

1640
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:26,020
 Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction

1640
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:26,020
传统电视购物涉及单向方向

1641
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:30,020
 Whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates certain things

1641
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:30,020
主持人介绍产品、展示某些事物

1642
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:32,020
 And say call this number or something

1642
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:32,020
并说拨打这个号码或其他什么

1643
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,020
 But live stream shopping is live

1643
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,020
但直播购物是直播

1644
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:37,020
 That in itself is a very, very big difference

1644
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:37,020
这本身就是一个非常非常大的区别

1645
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:39,020
 That causes different psychology

1645
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:39,020
从而导致不同的心理

1646
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:44,020
 And live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else

1646
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:44,020
直播购物是一种非常有趣的吸引他人的方式

1647
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:48,020
 When you shop, actually this live streaming video will continue

1647
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:48,020
当你购物的时候，其实这个直播视频还会继续

1648
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,020
 It will minimize into a corner

1648
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,020
它将最小化到一个角落

1649
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:54,020
 And you can buy the items and pay all on the same app

1649
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:54,020
您可以在同一个应用程序上购买商品并付款

1650
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:58,020
 After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself

1650
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:58,020
之后直播画面就会自行放大

1651
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,020
 And the promoter will come back to screen

1651
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,020
发起人将回到屏幕

1652
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:04,020
 So it's like very convenient

1652
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:04,020
所以感觉很方便

1653
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,020
 Taobao, one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms

1653
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,020
淘宝，中国最大的电子商务平台之一

1654
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:12,020
 Owned by tech giant Alibaba

1654
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:12,020
归科技巨头阿里巴巴所有

1655
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:15,020
 Added a live streaming function in early 2016

1655
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:15,020
2016年初新增直播功能

1656
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:19,020
 In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms

1656
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:19,020
在接下来的几年里，其他电子商务和社交平台

1657
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:22,020
 Like JD and Douyin also integrated this feature

1657
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:22,020
像京东和抖音也集成了这个功能

1658
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:45,020
 But in the past few years, it's been difficult to make a breakthrough

1658
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:45,020
但这几年却很难有所突破

1659
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:16,020
 People were in lockdown and many retailers were pushed online

1659
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:16,020
人们处于封锁状态，许多零售商被迫转向线上

1660
01:17:42,020 --> 01:18:05,020
 OK, so it's a long video. So I'm not going to...

1660
01:17:42,020 --> 01:18:05,020
好吧，所以这是一个很长的视频。所以我不会...

1661
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:15,260
 long video so I'm not going to yeah I'm not going to play the whole video but you can see now yeah

1661
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:15,260
视频很长，所以我不会播放整个视频，但你现在可以看到是的

1662
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:23,180
 in the past this Alibaba Jingdong is very big but I heard nowadays actually people don't buy so much

1662
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:23,180
以前这个阿里巴巴京东很大但是我听说现在人其实不买那么多了

1663
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:30,060
 from it anymore usually what people nowadays is using Pingdol right that's that's why I heard

1663
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:30,060
现在人们通常都在使用 Pingdol，这就是我听说的原因

1664
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:37,820
 from my wife yeah so nowadays people tend to buy very cheap stuff from Pingdol but recently I

1664
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:37,820
来自我妻子 是的，所以现在人们倾向于从 Pingdol 购买非常便宜的东西，但最近我

1665
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:44,780
 think last year or a few months ago there's also this event ZhaDian right you are you aware of it

1665
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:44,780
想想去年或者几个月前也有这个事件炸店吧你知道吗

1666
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:51,420
 okay if you do not know you can go and find out later anyway yeah so okay so this is actually

1666
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:51,420
好吧，如果你不知道，你可以稍后去了解一下，是的，好吧，这实际上是

1667
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:57,500
 therefore like video streaming right so one of the very important criteria is in order to support

1667
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:57,500
因此，就像视频流一样，非常重要的标准之一是为了支持

1668
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:03,260
 applications such as video streaming you must have a very powerful video compression and

1668
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:03,260
像视频流这样的应用程序你必须有非常强大的视频压缩和

1669
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:08,700
 streaming technology to support it so that's what we are going to study later on for this course

1669
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:08,700
流技术来支持它，这就是我们稍后将在本课程中研究的内容

1670
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:15,100
 which is how do we perform very efficient video compression and streaming and transmission

1670
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:15,100
这就是我们如何执行非常高效的视频压缩、流媒体和传输

1671
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:15,900
 okay

1671
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:15,900
好的

1672
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:33,740
 okay another application just as video on demand so video on demand okay so this again is one of

1672
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:33,740
好吧，另一个应用程序就像视频点播所以视频点播好吧，这又是其中之一

1673
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:40,140
 my very favorite animation right so I'll also would like to share with you so that you can

1673
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:40,140
我非常喜欢的动画，所以我也想与您分享，以便您可以

1674
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,180
 relax a bit more

1674
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,180
放松一点

1675
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:06,380

1675
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:06,380
来自电影大师宫崎骏、学院奖导演

1676
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:11,740
 spirited away that is ancient sorcery quite powerful too

1676
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:11,740
千与千寻那是古老的魔法也相当强大

1677

今年夏天，体验一位被神秘诅咒改变的年轻女子的史诗故事

1678
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:36,139
 oh that's really me isn't it an enchanted moving castle this is a magic house

1678
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:36,139
哦，这真的是我，这不是一座神奇的移动城堡，这是一座神奇的房子

1679
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:46,460
 and the one wizard powerful enough to set her free this charm will guarantee your safe return

1679
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:46,460
一位强大到足以让她自由的巫师，这个咒语将保证你安全返回

1680
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:53,340
 Walt Disney Studios presents a studio jiggly production of a Hayao Miyazaki film

1680
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:53,340
华特迪士尼工作室推出宫崎骏电影的工作室制作

1681
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,340
 hold on

1681
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,340
坚持，稍等

1682
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:03,420
 this June journey to amazing new worlds

1682
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:03,420
这个六月的奇妙新世界之旅

1683
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,740
 aboard Howl's moving castle

1683
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,740
登上哈尔的移动城堡

1684
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:21,740
 okay so this animation is also my daughter's favorite

1684
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:21,740
好吧，这个动画也是我女儿的最爱

1685
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:35,260
 okay so the next short video that I'm going to show is about video analytics so right nowadays

1685
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:35,260
好的，我要展示的下一个短视频是关于视频分析的，所以现在就是这样

1686
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:41,340
 you know that when together with AI and video you can do many tasks right so this particular

1686
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:41,340
你知道，当与人工智能和视频结合使用时，你可以正确完成许多任务，所以这个特殊的任务

1687
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:46,380
 video is mainly going to be focusing from the surveillance and analytics perspective

1687
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:46,380
视频主要从监控和分析的角度关注

1688
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:49,980
 so just to demonstrate some of the potential use cases

1688
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:49,980
所以只是为了展示一些潜在的用例

1689
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:49,980
 so

1689
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:49,980
所以

1690
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:54,620
 so

1690
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:54,620
所以

1691
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:13,740
 okay so just now from the particular video you can see that there's actually many kind of

1691
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:13,740
好的，刚才从特定视频中您可以看到实际上有很多种

1692
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:19,660
 tasks that can be achieved it turned out that actually currently I do have a project with an

1692
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:19,660
可以实现的任务 事实证明，实际上目前我确实有一个项目

1693
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:24,860
 industrial partner a lots of the tasks that's being described in the video actually we are also

1693
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:24,860
工业合作伙伴 视频中描述的许多任务实际上我们也在

1694
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:29,660
 doing it so we are quite familiar with some of those topics so pretty much for the particular

1694
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:29,660
这样做是为了让我们对其中一些主题非常熟悉，因此对于特定的主题非常熟悉

1695
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:34,940
 industrial project for example from the safety perspective we need to be able to detect smoke

1695
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:34,940
例如，从安全角度来看，工业项目我们需要能够检测烟雾

1696
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:42,139
 fire know whether persons are wearing the know the mask especially during the covid

1696
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:42,139
消防人员知道人们是否戴口罩，尤其是在新冠疫情期间

1697
01:24:42,139 --> 01:24:48,780
 period whether they are wearing the protective here PPE personal protective equipment okay

1697
01:24:42,139 --> 01:24:48,780
期间他们是否穿戴防护服 PPE 个人防护装备 还好

1698
01:24:49,019 --> 01:24:53,820
 also things like we try to you know track the movements of different objects

1698
01:24:49,019 --> 01:24:53,820
还有像我们试图让你知道的事情跟踪不同物体的运动

1699
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:59,740
 know count the person know perform action recognition human object interaction and so on

1699
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:59,740
知道计数人知道执行动作识别人类物体交互等等

1700
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:04,219
 so these are some of the things that we can do to analyze the video application

1700
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:04,219
所以这些是我们可以做的一些事情来分析视频应用程序

1701
01:25:07,179 --> 01:25:10,300
 okay let me see all right let me probably just quickly cover the next

1701
01:25:07,179 --> 01:25:10,300
好吧，让我看看，好吧，让我快速介绍下一个

1702
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:15,420
 uh two slides and then we'll you know take a short break so what are the current trends in

1702
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:15,420
嗯，两张幻灯片，然后我们会让您休息一下，那么当前的趋势是什么

1703
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:20,780
 no video signal processing so right of course in recent years we see that there's new

1703
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:20,780
没有视频信号处理所以当然近年来我们看到有新的

1704
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:26,620
 ai and deep learning algorithm and models right okay so this is particularly used in the context

1704
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:26,620
人工智能和深度学习算法和模型是正确的，所以这是特别在上下文中使用的

1705
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:32,780
 of video analytics and understanding okay and also progressively we have more and more

1705
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:32,780
视频分析和理解还不错，而且我们也逐渐拥有越来越多的

1706
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:38,620
 data that's being collected so therefore a new train will be the big data okay from the

1706
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:38,620
正在收集的数据，因此新火车将是来自

1707
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:45,340
 processing perspective we have a better processor larger storage devices and also there's a new

1707
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:45,340
从处理的角度来看，我们有更好的处理器更大的存储设备，而且还有一个新的

1708
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:51,260
 emerging consumer behavior that supports some of the application for example the video that

1708
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:51,260
支持某些应用程序的新兴消费者行为，例如视频

1709
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:56,780
 just now we show about the you know the e-commerce live streaming e-commerce these are some of the

1709
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:56,780
刚才我们展示了你知道的电子商务直播电子商务这些是一些

1710
01:25:56,780 --> 01:26:03,500
 emerging or new consumer behaviors that require the underlying technology to support it okay and

1710
01:25:56,780 --> 01:26:03,500
新兴或新的消费者行为需要底层技术的支持

1711
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:08,700
 of course over the years we have a better and better compression algorithm so this is what

1711
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:08,700
当然，多年来我们有越来越好的压缩算法，所以这就是

1712
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:14,460
 we are going to study as our next topic and then we have a better video analytics uh techniques

1712
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:14,460
我们将作为下一个主题进行研究，然后我们就有更好的视频分析呃技术

1713
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:19,500
 so in terms of the technical challenges so for this particular course as i mentioned we are

1713
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:19,500
因此，就技术挑战而言，对于我提到的这个特定课程，我们

1714
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:25,500
 be focusing on two things number one is the compression or coding yeah number two is on

1714
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:25,500
专注于两件事，第一件事是压缩或编码，第二件事是

1715
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:30,860
 the content analysis and understanding so from the perspective of compression and coding some of the

1715
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:30,860
所以从压缩和编码的角度对内容进行分析和理解一些

1716
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:37,260
 challenges is that we want our video always to have a better quality lower bit rate okay and also you

1716
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:37,260
挑战是我们希望我们的视频始终具有更好的质量和更低的比特率，好吧，还有你

1717
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:42,780
 need to uh offer a certain quality of services for example just now in the live streaming we need to

1717
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:42,780
需要呃提供一定质量的服务，例如现在在直播中我们需要

1718
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:49,179
 make sure that you know the delay the latency the video is smooth and so on right so from the context

1718
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:49,179
确保您从上下文中了解延迟、延迟、视频是否流畅等

1719
01:26:49,179 --> 01:26:56,139
 of uh no video content analysis and understanding so some of the challenges that we have is that

1719
01:26:49,179 --> 01:26:56,139
呃，没有视频内容分析和理解，所以我们面临的一些挑战是

1720
01:26:56,139 --> 01:27:01,580
 robust performance for example just now in the video that you see you do counting right you try

1720
01:26:56,139 --> 01:27:01,580
强大的性能，例如刚才在视频中，您看到您尝试计数正确

1721
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:08,380
 to detect uh no ppe right you try to detect for example uh post estimation you try to estimate

1721
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:08,380
要检测呃没有个人防护装备，你尝试检测例如呃后估计你尝试估计

1722
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:15,740
 you try to analyze the whether when the worker is performing certain tasks whether it's uh no help

1722
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:15,740
您尝试分析工人何时执行某些任务是否没有帮助

1723
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:22,060
 no kind of harmful to their uh posture and so on those we need to have a robust performance

1723
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:22,060
不会对他们的呃姿势等有害，我们需要有强劲的表现

1724
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:27,340
 so therefore robust performance is one of the key challenge so another common challenge that we have

1724
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:27,340
因此，稳健的性能是关键挑战之一，因此我们面临的另一个共同挑战

1725
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:34,140
 is the domain gap or shift or generalization so for example if you train on this data set right

1725
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:34,140
是域差距、移位或泛化，例如，如果您在此数据集上进行训练

1726
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:38,940
 you train on this data set but later on when you want to deploy to a new environment

1726
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:38,940
您在此数据集上进行训练，但稍后当您想要部署到新环境时

1727
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:46,380
 are you able to still achieve good performance right so this is the domain gap or shift or

1727
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:46,380
你是否仍然能够获得良好的性能，所以这是领域差距或转变或

1728
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:54,620
 generalization problem okay so other issues uh very well known in ai uh domain is no annotation

1728
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:54,620
泛化问题还好，所以其他问题在 ai 领域众所周知，没有注释

1729
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:59,340
 data collections and annotations are always expensive right so how do we address those

1729
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:59,340
数据收集和注释总是很昂贵，那么我们如何解决这些问题

1730
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:04,380
 problems that's why you have things like no nowadays uh pre-trained model followed by

1730
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:04,380
问题这就是为什么你现在没有预训练模型之类的原因

1731
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:10,540
 fine tuning or adaptation is becoming very uh popular it's because the data annotation is very

1731
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:10,540
微调或适应变得非常流行，因为数据注释非常

1732
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:16,780
 expensive but there's also other techniques like no training with a small number of data such as

1732
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:16,780
昂贵，但还有其他技术，例如无需使用少量数据进行训练，例如

1733
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:21,900
 few short learning and even training without no training data right which is for example known

1733
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:21,900
很少有短期学习，甚至在没有已知训练数据的情况下进行训练

1734
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:28,140
 as a zero short learning so these are some active research direction and challenge in this space here

1734
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:28,140
作为零短期学习，所以这些是这个领域的一些活跃的研究方向和挑战

1735
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:36,220
 right okay so with that i think we'll take a short break let's come back at say uh 8 15

1735
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:36,220
好的，所以我想我们会休息一下，然后在 8 月 15 日回来

1736
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:44,780
 let's come back 8 15

1736
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:44,780
我们回来吧 8 15

1737
01:28:59,340 --> 01:28:59,500

01:32:59,340 --> 01:32:59,500
你

1746
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:29,500

01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:10,340
你

1813
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:10,840
 you

1813
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:10,840
你

1814
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:11,340
 you

1814
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:11,340
你

1815
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:11,840
 you

1815
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:11,840
你

1816
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:17,100
 okay so let's continue so just now during the break there are some students asking some questions

1816
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:17,100
好的，我们继续吧，刚才休息的时候有一些学生问一些问题

1817
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:23,100
 regarding the exam so just now i just probably want to add on her which is uh this particular

1817
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:23,100
关于考试，所以现在我可能想补充一下她，呃，这个特别的

1818
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:31,100
 course right so in the past actually there are two lecturers who are teaching so uh last for example okay

1818
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:31,100
当然是对的，所以过去实际上有两位讲师在教学，所以呃最后一个例子，好吧

1819
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:37,740
 this course is offered in both semester semester one as well as semester two so the previous semester

1819
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:37,740
这门课程在第一学期和第二学期都提供，所以上一学期

1820
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:44,540
 there's actually a guest lecturer okay and then uh the semester before actually there's a second

1820
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:44,540
实际上有一位客座讲师，好吧，然后呃，之前的学期实际上有第二位

1821
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:51,580
 lecture so therefore uh that means what what i'm trying to say is that no uh usually i would suggest

1821
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:51,580
讲座所以呃这意味着我想说的是不呃通常我会建议

1822
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:58,700
 students can actually if they are not too sure about the exam question they can go to the uh library

1822
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:58,700
事实上，如果学生对考试题不太确定，他们可以去呃图书馆

1823
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:04,220
 and then download past year exam question for you know a few years like two years or so then roughly

1823
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:04,220
然后下载去年的考试题，你知道几年，比如两年左右，然后大致

1824
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:10,140
 you have a certain feel about what kind of questions you will come out already but it's just that for

1824
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:10,140
你已经对自己会提出什么样的问题有一定的感觉，但这只是为了

1825
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:16,540
 this particular course because for the past semesters there's always a second lecture so therefore uh

1825
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:16,540
这门特殊的课程因为过去的学期总是有第二堂课所以所以呃

1826
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:23,100
 what i'm trying to say is that i would still encourage you to know go to the library download

1826
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:23,100
我想说的是，我仍然鼓励您知道去图书馆下载

1827
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:29,100
 the past year exam question but only look at for example the first two questions yeah because the

1827
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:29,100
去年的考试问题，但只看前两个问题，是的，因为

1828
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:36,220
 first two questions are uh set by me the last two questions depending on which year sometimes is set

1828
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:36,220
前两个问题是我设置的，最后两个问题有时取决于哪一年设置

1829
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:42,620
 by another lecture so therefore with that then you have a better appreciation or feeling about how

1829
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:42,620
通过另一场讲座，因此您可以更好地欣赏或感受如何

1830
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:48,460
 the question will look like so that's one suggestion the second suggestion the second point is actually

1830
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:48,460
问题看起来像这样，这是一个建议，第二个建议，第二点实际上是

1831
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:54,300
 for a lot of the uh past year exam question for my lecture notes i'll try to include them into the

1831
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:54,300
对于我的讲义中去年的很多考试问题，我会尝试将它们包含在

1832
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:59,660
 lecture notes and then we'll go through those uh exercises and questions together so in even if

1832
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:59,660
讲义，然后我们将一起完成那些呃练习和问题，所以即使

1833
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:06,380
 you do not go and download those uh exam past year exam question but you by going through the lecture

1833
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:06,380
你不会去下载那些呃考试去年的考试问题，而是通过听讲座

1834
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:12,140
 exercises you would still have a certain feeling or familiarity with what kind of question they'll

1834
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:12,140
您仍然会对他们会提出什么样的问题有一定的感觉或熟悉

1835
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:17,500
 be asked okay so therefore you don't have to worry too much so it's up to you if you want to

1835
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:17,500
可以被问到，所以你不必太担心，所以这取决于你是否愿意

1836
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:23,020
 download the question from the library okay just be a bit aware that some of the question is set by

1836
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:23,020
从图书馆下载问题，好吧，请注意，有些问题是由

1837
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:29,260
 the second lecture so it may not be relevant okay so yeah and second is that you can also refer to

1837
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:29,260
第二个讲座所以它可能不相关，好吧所以是的，第二个是你也可以参考

1838
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:35,820
 our you know lecture exercise you know as far as possible i'll usually at least include some past

1838
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:35,820
我们的“你知道”讲座练习你尽可能知道，我通常至少会包括一些过去的内容

1839
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:40,780
 year exam question in the exercise okay in the lectures so that's the first point i just want to

1839
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:40,780
练习中的年度考试问题在讲座中可以，所以这是我想要的第一点

1840
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:48,059
 clarify uh the second point actually early on i already mentioned early on so uh for this year

1840
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:48,059
澄清呃第二点实际上很早就我已经提到过所以呃今年

1841
01:58:48,059 --> 01:58:54,940
 in terms of the dissertation right um yeah because we received really many many applications

1841
01:58:48,059 --> 01:58:54,940
就论文而言，嗯是的，因为我们收到了很多申请

1842
01:58:54,940 --> 01:59:01,420
 so unfortunately we don't have time to be able to reply each individual email so that's why you know

1842
01:58:54,940 --> 01:59:01,420
很遗憾，我们没有时间回复每封电子邮件，因此您知道

1843
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:08,139
 we want to ask for know your understanding that we will not be able to reply every single email

1843
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:08,139
我们无法回复每一封电子邮件，请您谅解

1844
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:14,380
 because there are just too many of them and also when we or at least for myself usually because

1844
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:14,380
因为它们太多了，而且当我们或至少我自己通常因为

1845
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:19,420
 there are so many applications so usually when i look at a student if i feel that he's a good

1845
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:19,420
有很多申请，所以通常当我看一个学生时，如果我觉得他是一个好人

1846
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:25,100
 student i'll assign the projects to him or her already and then afterwards i'll finish the

1846
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:25,100
学生，我已经将项目分配给他或她，然后我将完成

1847
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:32,380
 assignment of all my projects but subsequently actually there are a lot other strong students

1847
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:32,380
我所有项目的作业，但随后实际上还有很多其他优秀的学生

1848
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:39,180
 so therefore please don't feel that you know because i do not choose your you know choose you

1848
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:39,180
所以请不要觉得你知道，因为我不选择你，你知道选择你

1849
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:44,620
 is because you are not a good student it's just that there are too many and some of they are

1849
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:44,620
是因为你不是好学生，只是数量太多，有些是

1850
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:51,020
 actually some very strong students but somehow at the end i only uh kind of notice them later

1850
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:51,020
实际上有一些非常优秀的学生，但不知怎的，最后我只是呃后来才注意到他们

1851
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:56,380
 okay sometimes it's a the area may not match so well but sometimes it's just the way you know we

1851
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:56,380
好吧，有时这是一个区域可能不太匹配，但有时这只是你了解我们的方式

1852
01:59:56,380 --> 02:00:01,980
 just assign the projects so yeah i just want to clarify that so at least some of you have a

1852
01:59:56,380 --> 02:00:01,980
只是分配项目所以是的我只是想澄清一下所以至少你们中的一些人有一个

1853
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:12,940
 certain understanding why i did not reply to some of your email okay

1853
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:12,940
一定理解为什么我没有回复你的一些电子邮件好吗

1854
02:00:13,419 --> 02:00:15,500
 so

1854
02:00:13,419 --> 02:00:15,500
所以

1855
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:27,419
 all right okay so the next thing we are going to talk about is a few image and video standards

1855
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:27,419
好吧，接下来我们要讨论的是一些图像和视频标准

1856
02:00:27,419 --> 02:00:32,780
 here right so this slides give a quick summary of some of the image and video standards right

1856
02:00:27,419 --> 02:00:32,780
这张幻灯片快速总结了一些图像和视频标准

1857
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:38,219
 so if you have a quick look there's a few different entities or organizations that develop

1857
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:38,219
因此，如果您快速浏览一下，就会发现有一些不同的实体或组织正在开发

1858
02:00:38,220 --> 02:00:44,940
 standards so in early years we have this organization known as itut so itut they develop

1858
02:00:38,220 --> 02:00:44,940
标准，所以早年我们有一个名为 itut 的组织，所以 itut 他们开发了

1859
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:54,700
 the standards they they develop is called h.26x series so you can see a 261 okay 262 263 264 so

1859
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:54,700
他们开发的标准称为 h.26x 系列，因此您可以看到 261 好 262 263 264 所以

1860
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:59,980
 these are the standards that's developed by itut okay and then there's another organization which

1860
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:59,980
这些是国际电信联盟制定的标准，好吧，还有另一个组织

1861
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:06,780
 is impact also known as iso so for iso the standard that they develop they call impact series so you

1861
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:06,780
冲击也称为 ISO，所以对于 ISO，他们开发的标准称为冲击系列，所以您

1862
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:12,540
 have impact one impact two impact four all right and so on and so forth right they are also sometimes

1862
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:12,540
有影响一 影响二 影响四 好吧，依此类推，对，有时也是

1863
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:19,259
 when this itut and iso they try to develop the standard together right so some of the well-known

1863
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:19,259
当国际电信联盟和国际标准化组织尝试共同制定标准时，一些众所周知的标准

1864
02:01:19,259 --> 02:01:24,300
 one is actually this impact two actually this impact two by right they should draw it here

1864
02:01:19,259 --> 02:01:24,300
一实际上是这个影响二实际上是这个影响二对了他们应该把它画在这里

1865
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:31,500
 because it's jointly developed by them okay h.264 is also jointly developed by them and then h.265

1865
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:31,500
因为它是他们联合开发的好吧h.264也是他们联合开发的然后h.265

1866
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:37,580
 so some of the standards are jointly developed by them so on top of that you also have some other

1866
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:37,580
所以有些标准是由他们联合制定的，所以除此之外你还有其他一些标准

1867
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:44,460
 organization for example this uh society of moving picture and television engineer they develop vc1

1867
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:44,460
组织例如这个呃电影和电视工程师协会他们开发了vc1

1868
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:50,380
 standard and google they also develop their own sets of standards as well so these are a few

1868
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:50,380
标准和谷歌他们也制定了自己的标准集，所以这些是一些

1869
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:55,820
 different organizations that develop the video standard so when they talk about video standard

1869
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:55,820
开发视频标准的不同组织因此当他们谈论视频标准时

1870
02:01:55,820 --> 02:02:04,139
 what it means is a video compression okay or coding standard so let's quickly go through some

1870
02:01:55,820 --> 02:02:04,139
它的意思是视频压缩或编码标准，所以让我们快速浏览一下

1871
02:02:04,139 --> 02:02:10,299
 of these well-known standards so the first standard that we have is the jpeg standard so jpeg i think

1871
02:02:04,139 --> 02:02:10,299
在这些众所周知的标准中，我们拥有的第一个标准是 jpeg 标准，所以我认为 jpeg

1872
02:02:10,299 --> 02:02:14,940
 most some of you probably have heard about it before it's a very popular image compression

1872
02:02:10,299 --> 02:02:14,940
你们中的大多数人可能在它成为一种非常流行的图像压缩之前就听说过它

1873
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:22,380
 standard so it's used to compress image so jpeg is also known as iso iec international standard

1873
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:22,380
标准，因此用于压缩图像，因此 jpeg 也称为 iso iec 国际标准

1874
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:30,380
 10918 or itut recommendation t.81 so of course you don't have to memorize this number

1874
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:30,380
10918 或 itut 建议 t.81 所以当然你不必记住这个号码

1875
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:35,500
 you know it's just kind of for your information right so officially jpeg is known as these two

1875
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:35,500
你知道这只是为了给你提供信息，所以正式 jpeg 被称为这两个

1876
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:40,620
 standards so if any of you are interested you can go and download this particular

1876
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:40,620
标准，所以如果你们中的任何人感兴趣，您可以去下载这个特定的

1877
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:46,380
 jpeg standard it's the size of a book right so there's no need to go and spend too much time

1877
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:46,380
jpeg 标准，正好是一本书的大小，因此无需花费太多时间

1878
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:53,340
 reading it up okay and it's developed by a particular body known as joint photographic

1878
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:53,340
仔细阅读它，它是由一个称为联合摄影的特定机构开发的

1879
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:58,060
 expert group or jpeg so that's why this particular image compression standard

1879
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:58,060
专家组或 jpeg，这就是为什么这个特定的图像压缩标准

1880
02:02:58,620 --> 02:03:03,420
 afterwards you know take over the name of this body that developed the standard

1880
02:02:58,620 --> 02:03:03,420
之后您就知道接管制定该标准的机构的名称

1881
02:03:06,940 --> 02:03:13,580
 right okay so next we are going to look at the families of mpeg standards here so mpeg standard

1881
02:03:06,940 --> 02:03:13,580
好吧，接下来我们要看看 mpeg 标准的家族，所以 mpeg 标准

1882
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:20,780
 started in 92 right so the first standard that was developed is called mpeg one right so mpeg one

1882
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:20,780
开始于 92 对，所以开发的第一个标准称为 mpeg one 对，所以 mpeg one

1883
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:26,940
 is a standard that contain video compression and it also perform audio compression right so at the

1883
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:26,940
是一个包含视频压缩的标准，它还执行音频压缩，因此

1884
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:33,820
 time is trying to target the application which is like you know for cd-rom okay for cd-rom right so

1884
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:33,820
时间正在尝试定位应用程序，就像您知道的 cd-rom 一样，对于 cd-rom 来说也可以，所以

1885
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:39,740
 i'm not even too sure for your generation whether you know what cd-rom right so cd-rom is something

1885
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:39,740
我什至不太确定你们这一代人是否知道什么是 cd-rom，所以 cd-rom 是一种东西

1886
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:46,219
 like this that is like the music cd that you listen to right so but it's for computer so that's

1886
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:46,219
就像这样，就像你听的音乐CD一样，但它是用于电脑的，所以这是

1887
02:03:46,219 --> 02:03:53,260
 cd-rom so at the time is targeting for cd-rom and the bit rate is 1.5 megabits per second so that's

1887
02:03:46,219 --> 02:03:53,260
cd-rom，所以当时的目标是 cd-rom，比特率为每秒 1.5 兆比特，所以这是

1888
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:59,019
 the target bit rate so arising from this particular mpeg one standard there's a particular commercial

1888
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:59,019
目标比特率，因此由这个特定的 mpeg 一个标准产生，有一个特定的商业广告

1889
02:03:59,019 --> 02:04:05,740
 product arising from it which is known as the vcd so any one of you have watched vcd before

1889
02:03:59,019 --> 02:04:05,740
由此产生的产品被称为 vcd，所以你们中的任何一个人以前都看过 vcd

1890
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:12,540
 right it's probably two you are still too young so at the time i still remember i was in i can

1890
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:12,540
是的，可能是两岁了，你还太年轻，所以当时我还记得我在我可以

1891
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:19,340
 remember in in high school or in university if you want to watch a standard movie 60 minute

1891
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:19,340
如果你想看一部 60 分钟的标准电影，记得在高中或大学时

1892
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:25,260
 a movie you need two of this vcd this okay right so this is uh during the early years

1892
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:25,260
一部电影你需要两张这样的 VCD 没关系，所以这是早年的呃

1893
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:31,420
 right okay and afterwards uh things of course start to progress then we move on to mpeg two

1893
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:31,420
好吧，然后呃事情当然开始进展然后我们继续 mpeg 2

1894
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:38,300
 standard so mpeg two standard is also known as the h.262 right so it was developed in 94 many

1894
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:38,300
标准所以mpeg二标准也被称为h.262对所以它是在94年制定的

1895
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:44,140
 years ago so one of the key characteristics of this mpeg two standard is that it's a video and

1895
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:44,140
几年前，这个 mpeg 两个标准的关键特征之一是它是一个视频和

1896
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:50,780
 audio coding with different profile okay so this different profile means that is trying to target

1896
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:50,780
具有不同配置文件的音频编码好吧，所以这个不同的配置文件意味着正在尝试定位

1897
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:57,980
 for different use cases in application right okay so in different applications sometimes there's a

1897
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:57,980
对于应用程序中的不同用例，好吧，所以在不同的应用程序中有时会有一个

1898
02:04:57,980 --> 02:05:04,139
 different uh you know kind of image quality requirement some of them can be smaller some

1898
02:04:57,980 --> 02:05:04,139
不同的呃你知道图像质量要求有些可以更小一些

1899
02:05:04,139 --> 02:05:11,980
 of them the the size can be bigger and also their quality uh quality expectation is different okay

1899
02:05:04,139 --> 02:05:11,980
其中尺寸可以更大，而且质量呃质量期望也不同好吗

1900
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:19,099
 some is probably for lower end kind of use cases some is for some higher quality video so because

1900
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:19,099
有些可能用于低端用例，有些用于更高质量的视频，所以因为

1901
02:05:19,099 --> 02:05:26,620
 of that you have a wider range of the bit rate okay so for mpeg two it can cover a wider range

1901
02:05:19,099 --> 02:05:26,620
其中你有更广泛的比特率范围，所以对于 mpeg 2 它可以覆盖更广泛的范围

1902
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:33,180
 of bit rate from two to 80 megabits per second so the relevant products okay so the product arising

1902
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:33,180
比特率从每秒 2 兆比特到 80 兆比特，因此相关产品还可以，因此产品出现了

1903
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:39,580
 from this mpeg two is a dvd i think dvd very likely you probably heard about it if not at

1903
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:39,580
从这个 mpeg 两个是一张 DVD，我认为 DVD 很可能你可能听说过它，如果不是在

1904
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:45,740
 least your parents you know should still have some uh dvds from the older days okay and then

1904
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:45,740
至少你知道你的父母应该还保留着一些以前的 DVD 好吧，然后

1905
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:52,140
 things start to uh move on then we have the mpeg four so mpeg four is actually a content based video

1905
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:52,140
事情开始进展，然后我们有了 mpeg 4，所以 mpeg 4 实际上是一个基于内容的视频

1906
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:57,660
 coding that means you try to contain uh perform video compression by looking at the content of

1906
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:57,660
编码意味着您尝试通过查看内容来包含呃执行视频压缩

1907
02:05:57,660 --> 02:06:04,380
 the video right so some of the very unique features of mpeg four is that uh it provide

1907
02:05:57,660 --> 02:06:04,380
视频正确，所以 mpeg 4 的一些非常独特的功能是它提供

1908
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:11,500
 uh coding coding actually also means compression so coding or compressions of natural or synthetic

1908
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:11,500
呃编码实际上也意味着压缩所以自然或合成的编码或压缩

1909
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:16,700
 media objects so either the object is natural occurring or whether it's for example some

1909
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:16,700
媒体对象，因此该对象要么是自然发生的，要么是某些

1910
02:06:16,700 --> 02:06:22,620
 animation the kind of generated content or synthetic content so mpeg four is used to target

1910
02:06:16,700 --> 02:06:22,620
动画 生成内容或合成内容的类型，因此使用 mpeg 4 来定位

1911
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:32,540
 to compress those kinds of uh content right okay then afterwards we move on to the h.26x series of

1911
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:32,540
压缩这些类型的内容，好吧，然后我们继续讨论 h.26x 系列

1912
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:38,139
 the standards okay so this is another important family of the standards here so it started in

1912
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:38,139
标准还可以，所以这是这里标准的另一个重要系列，所以它开始于

1913
02:06:38,139 --> 02:06:45,740
 many years ago it started off with a h.261 so it's developed in uh 90s right by this particular

1913
02:06:38,139 --> 02:06:45,740
许多年前，它从 h.261 开始，所以它是在 90 年代由这个特定的人开发的

1914
02:06:45,740 --> 02:06:51,900
 organization known as the ccitt so ccitt again the name you don't have to memorize it's just

1914
02:06:45,740 --> 02:06:51,900
组织称为 ccitt，所以 ccitt 再次是您不必记住的名称，它只是

1915
02:06:51,900 --> 02:07:00,139
 for your information so ccitt stand for international telegraph and telephone consultative committee

1915
02:06:51,900 --> 02:07:00,139
供您参考，ccitt 代表国际电报和电话咨询委员会

1916
02:07:00,139 --> 02:07:08,219
 right but this uh body later on was renamed as itut right if you look at the full name is international

1916
02:07:00,139 --> 02:07:08,219
是的，但是这个呃机构后来被更名为itut，如果你看一下全名是international，就对了

1917
02:07:08,219 --> 02:07:13,500
 telecom nation union international telecom nations standardization sector right so you don't have to

1917
02:07:08,219 --> 02:07:13,500
电信国家联盟 国际电信国家标准化部门的权利，因此您不必

1918
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:18,460
 worry too much about it because it's quite a lot but probably what you need to know is that

1918
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:18,460
太担心了，因为它太多了，但可能你需要知道的是

1919
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:27,900
 right this standard was uh developed by itut okay so uh this particular standard is uh based on dct

1919
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:27,900
是的，这个标准是由 itut 开发的，所以这个特定标准是基于 DCT 的

1920
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:35,180
 based video compression uh scheme so dct is a discrete cosine transform so it's the types of

1920
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:35,180
基于视频压缩呃方案，所以 DCT 是离散余弦变换，所以它的类型

1921
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:41,900
 uh transform that we are going to study later on so therefore for this particular standard h.261

1921
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:41,900
嗯，我们稍后将研究这个变换，因此对于这个特定的标准 h.261

1922
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:47,019
 right is used to perform video compression and is using this particular dct transform

1922
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:47,019
右边用于执行视频压缩并使用这种特定的 DCT 变换

1923
02:07:47,019 --> 02:07:54,620
 discrete cosine transform okay and it has many similarity with mpeg-1 okay its original target

1923
02:07:47,019 --> 02:07:54,620
离散余弦变换好吧，它与 mpeg-1 有很多相似之处，好吧它的原始目标

1924
02:07:54,620 --> 02:08:01,580
 application is for video conferencing so originally when uh no the body developed this h.261

1924
02:07:54,620 --> 02:08:01,580
应用程序用于视频会议，所以最初当呃不，机构开发了这个 h.261

1925
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:08,219
 is mainly for uh tele video or teleconferencing so that means no when i call you right you'll

1925
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:08,219
主要用于呃电话视频或电话会议，所以这意味着不，当我打电话给你时，你会

1926
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:15,820
 be able to talk to me in uh real time so because it's used for video conferencing therefore their

1926
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:15,820
能够实时与我交谈，因为它用于视频会议，所以他们

1927
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:20,940
 bit rate requirement is very low yeah because it's for video conferencing that means you need to be

1927
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:20,940
比特率要求非常低，是的，因为它用于视频会议，这意味着您需要

1928
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:27,020
 able to perform the compression very quickly yeah so you need to be fast you need to compress it

1928
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:27,020
能够非常快地执行压缩是的，所以你需要很快，你需要压缩它

1929
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:32,140
 very quickly and you need to transmit this particular video right very quickly that means

1929
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:32,140
非常快，您需要非常快地传输该特定视频，这意味着

1930
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:39,500
 the bit rate need to be very low so therefore for this h.261 their bit rate is a multiple of

1930
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:39,500
比特率需要非常低，因此对于 h.261，它们的比特率是

1931
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:47,020
 64 kilobits per second right so first 64 kilobits per second is very low okay so yeah whereas the p

1931
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:47,020
64 kbps 是的，所以第一个 64 kbps 非常低，好吧，所以是的，而 p

1932
02:08:47,020 --> 02:08:53,660
 can run from uh values of 1 to 30 so it's actually very low bit rate so therefore you can kind of

1932
02:08:47,020 --> 02:08:53,660
可以从 1 到 30 的值运行，所以它实际上是非常低的比特率，因此你可以

1933
02:08:53,660 --> 02:09:01,500
 recognize in the early days right h.26 series of standard initially is mainly used for you know

1933
02:08:53,660 --> 02:09:01,500
早期认识对的h.26系列标准最初主要是用于大家知道的

1934
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:06,860
 video conferencing therefore the requirement is that it has to be low bit rate the compression

1934
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:06,860
因此视频会议的要求是它必须是低比特率压缩

1935
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:15,020
 need to be fast yeah because you are using it for video conferencing okay and then afterwards uh no

1935
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:15,020
需要快点是的，因为你正在使用它进行视频会议，好吧，然后呃不

1936
02:09:15,020 --> 02:09:21,740
 the next major standard right there's actually a h.262 right okay if you see this one now there's

1936
02:09:15,020 --> 02:09:21,740
下一个主要标准实际上是 h.262 好吧，如果你现在看到这个

1937
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:25,580
 a h.263 already what happened to h.262

1937
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:25,580
h.263 已经发生了 h.262 的情况

1938
02:09:36,860 --> 02:09:45,820
 right you can see it's a h.261 usually 261 you expect 262 263 and so on right so what happened

1938
02:09:36,860 --> 02:09:45,820
是的，您可以看到它是 h.261，通常是 261，您期望的是 262 263 等等，所以发生了什么

1939
02:09:45,820 --> 02:09:48,380
 there's a missing h.262

1939
02:09:45,820 --> 02:09:48,380
缺少 h.262

1940
02:09:53,099 --> 02:09:59,259
 so it turned out that right if you remember this uh iso and itut sometimes they work together they

1940
02:09:53,099 --> 02:09:59,259
所以事实证明，如果你还记得这个呃 iso 和 itut 有时它们会一起工作，那就对了

1941
02:09:59,259 --> 02:10:05,740
 collaborate so it turned out that this h.262 is also known as impact 2 that we covered early on

1941
02:09:59,259 --> 02:10:05,740
合作，结果证明这个 h.262 也被称为我们之前介绍过的 Impact 2

1942
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:14,620
 so therefore h.262 is also uh impact 2 yeah so 262 is also known as impact 2 they are the same

1942
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:14,620
因此，h.262 也是呃 Impact 2 是的，所以 262 也称为 Impact 2 它们是相同的

1943
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:20,380
 right so it was uh because it was jointly developed by these two uh organizations okay so

1943
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:20,380
是的所以是呃因为它是这两个呃组织联合开发的好吧所以

1944
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:25,660
 because it's covered in impact 2 already so we will not touch it here so uh the objective of

1944
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:25,660
因为它已经在影响 2 中涵盖了，所以我们不会在这里触及它，所以呃目标

1945
02:10:25,660 --> 02:10:30,620
 today's lecture is more for uh overview or quick introduction so we are not going to go into the

1945
02:10:25,660 --> 02:10:30,620
今天的讲座更多的是呃概述或快速介绍，所以我们不打算深入

1946
02:10:30,620 --> 02:10:40,059
 detail in subsequent lecture we will learn more about it okay so this h.263 right is um okay

1946
02:10:30,620 --> 02:10:40,059
在接下来的讲座中我们将详细了解它，所以这个 h.263 权利是好的

1947
02:10:40,060 --> 02:10:45,100
 there's actually a few different versions of it so the first version v1 is developed in 95

1947
02:10:40,060 --> 02:10:45,100
实际上有几个不同的版本，所以第一个版本 v1 是在 95 年开发的

1948
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:52,060
 okay so of course you expect the performance is better than the previous uh 261 okay so it's also

1948
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:52,060
好吧，你当然期望性能比之前的呃 261 更好，好吧，所以它也是

1949
02:10:52,060 --> 02:10:58,060
 mainly for video conferencing therefore you expect it to be fast you expect the bit rate to be low

1949
02:10:52,060 --> 02:10:58,060
主要用于视频会议，因此您希望它很快，您希望比特率较低

1950
02:10:58,060 --> 02:11:03,980
 okay yeah and afterwards there's a new improvement version 2 and version 3 so for version 2 and version

1950
02:10:58,060 --> 02:11:03,980
好的，是的，之后有一个新的改进版本 2 和版本 3，所以对于版本 2 和版本

1951
02:11:04,059 --> 02:11:11,339
 3 we call also called uh 263 plus and plus plus okay so these are different versions or improvement

1951
02:11:04,059 --> 02:11:11,339
3 我们也称之为呃 263 plus 和 plus plus 好吧，所以这些是不同的版本或改进

1952
02:11:13,099 --> 02:11:21,019
 right okay and then afterwards things uh continue on then we move on to h.264 so h.264 again there's

1952
02:11:13,099 --> 02:11:21,019
好吧，然后事情继续，然后我们转向 h.264，所以 h.264 又出现了

1953
02:11:21,019 --> 02:11:27,660
 a few common name that's being used right we can call it h.264 sometimes we also call it advanced

1953
02:11:21,019 --> 02:11:27,660
一些常用的名称，我们可以称之为 h.264，有时我们也称之为高级

1954
02:11:27,660 --> 02:11:34,540
 video coding or avc okay sometimes they also call it mpeg for part 10 so all this refer to the same

1954
02:11:27,660 --> 02:11:34,540
视频编码或 avc 好吧，有时他们也将其称为 mpeg 第 10 部分，所以所有这些都指的是相同的

1955
02:11:34,540 --> 02:11:43,180
 thing okay so it was standardized in 2003 right uh of course you expect since it was a later standard

1955
02:11:34,540 --> 02:11:43,180
事情还好，所以它是在 2003 年标准化的，呃，当然你期望的，因为它是后来的标准

1956
02:11:43,180 --> 02:11:49,180
 right it's going to perform better than uh the previous version h.263 all right so it has a

1956
02:11:43,180 --> 02:11:49,180
是的，它的性能会比之前的版本 h.263 更好，所以它有一个

1957
02:11:49,180 --> 02:11:55,500
 wide range of application like internet video computer no hd tv uh blu-ray and so on and so

1957
02:11:49,180 --> 02:11:55,500
应用范围广泛，例如互联网视频计算机没有高清电视呃蓝光等等

1958
02:11:55,980 --> 02:12:02,540
 so nowadays right if you go to the internet right and if you download a video very likely the standard

1958
02:11:55,980 --> 02:12:02,540
所以现在如果你上网并且下载视频很可能是标准

1959
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:08,140
 that you are going to get is the h.264 or mp4 right if all some of you have downloaded some

1959
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:08,140
如果你们所有人都下载了一些，那么您将获得的是 h.264 或 mp4

1960
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:14,620
 video nowadays right this is currently the most popular and dominant uh video standard at the

1960
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:14,620
视频现在是正确的，这是目前最流行和占主导地位的呃视频标准

1961
02:12:14,620 --> 02:12:22,220
 moment okay h.264 right okay and then afterwards things continue you know i mean the body continue

1961
02:12:14,620 --> 02:12:22,220
好吧 h.264 好吧好吧然后事情继续你知道我的意思是身体继续

1962
02:12:22,220 --> 02:12:28,300
 to improve the standard so the next one is the h.265 all right so it's also known as a high

1962
02:12:22,220 --> 02:12:28,300
改进标准，所以下一个是 h.265 好吧，所以它也被称为高

1963
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:37,660
 evision video coding or gvc here so uh it's basic structure right in terms of the algorithm is very

1963
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:37,660
evision 视频编码或 gvc 这里所以呃它的基本结构就算法而言是非常

1964
02:12:37,660 --> 02:12:45,820
 similar to 264 okay but it has a few uh feature it can support higher resolution now 8k resolution

1964
02:12:37,660 --> 02:12:45,820
类似于 264 好吧，但它有一些呃功能，它可以支持更高分辨率，现在 8k 分辨率

1965
02:12:45,820 --> 02:12:52,460
 and up to 120 frame per second right okay and also uh it's more efficient in terms of a bit

1965
02:12:45,820 --> 02:12:52,460
每秒高达 120 帧，好吧，而且呃，就一点而言，效率更高

1966
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:59,259
 rate quality trade-off right uh because typically right for a good video you want the bit rate to be

1966
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:59,259
速率质量权衡是正确的，因为通常对于一个好的视频来说，您希望比特率是

1967
02:12:59,259 --> 02:13:04,540
 low and you want the quality to be high but usually if your bit rate is low your quality

1967
02:12:59,259 --> 02:13:04,540
低，您希望质量高，但通常如果您的比特率低，您的质量

1968
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:11,820
 will not be so good and vice versa so as a whole h.265 can actually achieve this trade-off better

1968
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:11,820
不会那么好，反之亦然，因此作为一个整体，h.265 实际上可以更好地实现这种权衡

1969
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:12,860
 than 264

1969
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:12,860
超过 264

1970
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:23,660
 right okay so the mpeg and the h.26x series are two dominant important video compression standards

1970
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:23,660
好吧，所以 mpeg 和 h.26x 系列是两个占主导地位的重要视频压缩标准

1971
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:30,700
 but there are also some other standards uh out there so the first one is vc1 so vc1 is uh developed

1971
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:30,700
但还有一些其他标准，所以第一个标准是 vc1，所以 vc1 是开发的

1972
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:37,900
 by this uh society known as society of motion picture and tv television engineers right it was

1972
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:37,900
这个呃协会被称为电影和电视电视工程师协会，没错，就是这样

1973
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:45,259
 supported by a microsoft uh window media video so these are more like no factual information

1973
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:45,259
由微软呃窗口媒体视频支持，所以这些更像是没有事实信息

1974
02:13:45,259 --> 02:13:48,860
 because if you are studying this course and people ask you know you are studying about

1974
02:13:45,259 --> 02:13:48,860
因为如果你正在学习这门课程并且人们问你知道你正在学习什么

1975
02:13:48,860 --> 02:13:53,500
 video compression can you at least tell us some of the standard at least you'll be aware you know

1975
02:13:48,860 --> 02:13:53,500
视频压缩你能至少告诉我们一些标准吗至少你会知道你知道

1976
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:59,580
 these are currently some of the you know standards that's out there okay so another uh recent popular

1976
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:59,580
这些是目前一些你知道的标准，好吧，所以另一个呃最近流行的标准

1977
02:13:59,580 --> 02:14:08,220
 one is uh this vp8 so vp8 is target for a web video right the video that's embedded in the

1977
02:13:59,580 --> 02:14:08,220
一个是呃，这个 vp8，所以 vp8 是网络视频的目标，该视频嵌入在

1978
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:14,860
 internet right okay so it support this web video format and it can support up to 4k resolution

1978
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:14,860
互联网没问题，所以它支持这种网络视频格式，并且最高可以支持 4k 分辨率

1979
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:21,500
 okay and vp9 is also developed by google right so it's an improvement to vp8 so you can see

1979
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:21,500
好的，vp9 也是由 google 开发的，所以它是 vp8 的改进，所以你可以看到

1980
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:26,860
 its structure is actually similar to vp8 so it's an improvement but in terms of resolution now

1980
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:26,860
它的结构实际上与 vp8 类似，所以它是一个改进，但在分辨率方面现在

1981
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:32,700
 it's better it can support up to 8k and 120 uh frame per second so yeah so these are some of the

1981
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:32,700
最好它可以支持每秒 8k 和 120 uh 帧，所以是的，这些是其中的一些

1982
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:41,660
 popular and current major standards out there right okay so the next topic we want to very

1982
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:41,660
流行的和当前的主要标准就在那里，好吧，所以下一个主题我们想要非常

1983
02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:47,179
 quickly touch on is on the video analysis and understanding so uh early on as i mentioned for

1983
02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:47,179
快速触及视频分析和理解，正如我早些时候提到的

1984
02:14:47,179 --> 02:14:52,620
 this course right there's the compression there's a video analytics and actually uh there's also

1984
02:14:47,179 --> 02:14:52,620
这门课程有压缩，有视频分析，实际上呃还有

1985
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:58,300
 going to be on the emerging direction but the part i have not finalized it so these are the a few key

1985
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:58,300
将是新兴方向，但我还没有最终确定，所以这些是几个关键

1986
02:14:58,940 --> 02:15:04,220
 expect for this particular course so under the video analysis and understanding so what we'll

1986
02:14:58,940 --> 02:15:04,220
期待这个特定的课程，所以根据视频分析和理解，我们会做什么

1987
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:10,860
 do is that we'll try to you know uh for this course these are some of the tasks we'll be studying

1987
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:10,860
要做的是，我们会尽力让您知道，呃，对于本课程，这些是我们将要学习的一些任务

1988
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:16,460
 because even for video content and analysis now there's many many many different topics that you

1988
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:16,460
因为即使对于视频内容和分析，现在也有很多很多不同的主题

1989
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:23,340
 can uh talk about so that's why we are going to select some no use case right on an application

1989
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:23,340
呃，可以谈谈吗，这就是为什么我们要在应用程序上选择一些无用例的原因

1990
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:28,940
 and try to you know explain them or cover in this lecture so in this lecture some of the important

1990
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:28,940
并尝试让您知道在本次讲座中解释或涵盖这些内容，因此在本次讲座中一些重要的内容

1991
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:35,260
 tasks that we'll cover including uh object detections and tracking okay uh post estimation for

1991
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:35,260
我们将涵盖的任务包括呃物体检测和跟踪好吧呃后期估计

1992
02:15:35,260 --> 02:15:40,380
 example how do you detect uh different poles of the human right just now you can also see from the

1992
02:15:35,260 --> 02:15:40,380
例如，你现在如何检测人类的不同极点，你也可以从

1993
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:45,260
 video that we have no for post estimation one very common things is that you can use to

1993
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:45,260
我们没有用于后期评估的视频，一个非常常见的事情是您可以使用

1994
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:51,660
 you know study for example the ergonomics right you can use do uh jayshir recognition for example

1994
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:51,660
例如，你知道研究人体工程学，你可以使用例如 jayshir 识别

1995
02:15:51,660 --> 02:15:57,660
 recognize different hand jayshir you can use to uh once you estimate different poles on the body

1995
02:15:51,660 --> 02:15:57,660
一旦你估计了身体上的不同极点，你就可以识别出不同的手 jayshir

1996
02:15:57,660 --> 02:16:02,860
 you can also use it to perform action recognition trying to find out whether they are no drinking

1996
02:15:57,660 --> 02:16:02,860
你还可以用它来进行动作识别，试图找出他们是否没有喝酒

1997
02:16:02,860 --> 02:16:09,980
 water or walking or playing balls and things like that so those are the post estimation but okay we

1997
02:16:02,860 --> 02:16:09,980
水、散步或打球之类的事情，所以这些是事后估计，但好吧，我们

1998
02:16:10,379 --> 02:16:16,459
 also will be covering some action recognition so you'll try to analyze different actions in

1998
02:16:10,379 --> 02:16:16,459
还将涵盖一些动作识别，因此您将尝试分析不同的动作

1999
02:16:16,459 --> 02:16:22,540
 the video human actions in the video so these are some of the selected uh topics we'll cover under

1999
02:16:16,459 --> 02:16:22,540
视频中的人类行为，所以这些是我们将在下面讨论的一些选定的呃主题

2000
02:16:22,540 --> 02:16:32,059
 this video analysis right okay so next i'm going to play you a few short video to explain

2000
02:16:22,540 --> 02:16:32,059
这个视频分析得不错，接下来我会播放一些短片来解释一下

2001
02:16:32,619 --> 02:16:35,820
 right some of those tasks that object detection

2001
02:16:32,619 --> 02:16:35,820
正确处理对象检测的一些任务

2002
02:16:38,379 --> 02:16:42,699
 yeah so next i'll try to play you a short a few short video to explain some of the

2002
02:16:38,379 --> 02:16:42,699
是的，接下来我会尝试播放一段简短的视频来解释一些

2003
02:16:42,699 --> 02:16:48,859
 tasks that we have uh mentioned in case because i know that for your group your background is

2003
02:16:42,699 --> 02:16:48,859
我们提到的任务以防万一，因为我知道对于您的团队来说，您的背景是

2004
02:16:48,859 --> 02:16:54,699
 very diverse you have some students which has a bit more experience in you know this AI computer

2004
02:16:48,859 --> 02:16:54,699
非常多样化，你有一些学生，他们在你了解这台人工智能计算机方面有更多的经验

2005
02:16:54,699 --> 02:17:00,059
 vision but there's also a large percentage of a student who doesn't have this background so i'll

2005
02:16:54,699 --> 02:17:00,059
愿景，但也有很大一部分学生没有这种背景，所以我会

2006
02:17:00,059 --> 02:17:04,939
 play you a few short video just to give you some sense about some of the tasks that we are going

2006
02:17:00,059 --> 02:17:04,939
给您播放一些简短的视频，让您了解我们即将完成的一些任务

2007
02:17:04,939 --> 02:17:10,139
 to cover in the later part of lecture so that you have a certain idea so the first task that we are

2007
02:17:04,939 --> 02:17:10,139
在讲座的后面部分进行介绍，以便您有一定的想法，因此我们的第一个任务是

2008
02:17:10,139 --> 02:17:16,219
 going to do is about object detection so i'll play you this video it's about two minutes plus

2008
02:17:10,139 --> 02:17:16,219
要做的是关于物体检测，所以我会给你播放这个视频，大约两分钟多

2009
02:17:16,219 --> 02:17:25,260
 to explain what object detection is a pinnacle in artificial intelligence but it co-exists with us

2009
02:17:16,219 --> 02:17:25,260
解释什么对象检测是人工智能的顶峰但它与我们共存

2010
02:17:25,260 --> 02:17:31,260
 in our lives hiding in plain sight we often fail to notice simple applications of object

2010
02:17:25,260 --> 02:17:31,260
在我们的生活中，我们经常忽视对象的简单应用

2011
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:38,860
 detection around us have you ever wondered how a face unlock works on your smartphone or how a

2011
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:38,860
我们周围的检测您是否想知道智能手机上的面部解锁如何工作，或者如何

2012
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:46,540
 self-driving car operates on its own the answer is object detection so what is object detection

2012
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:46,540
自动驾驶汽车自行运行答案是物体检测那么什么是物体检测

2013
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:53,020
 technically object detection is a technology that includes computer vision and image processing

2013
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:53,020
从技术上讲，目标检测是一项包括计算机视觉和图像处理的技术

2014
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:58,780
 used to detect objects in images or videos sounds interesting let's break it down for you

2014
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:58,780
用于检测图像或视频中的对象听起来很有趣让我们为您分解一下

2015
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:04,780
 using a simple example self-driving cars make use of the moving object detection technology

2015
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:04,780
举一个简单的例子，自动驾驶汽车利用移动物体检测技术

2016
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:10,380
 where computer vision and image processing are used to determine the distance between the car

2016
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:10,380
使用计算机视觉和图像处理来确定汽车之间的距离

2017
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:16,380
 and the moving objects to create alerts and guide the self-driving cars you must be wondering what

2017
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:16,380
以及移动物体来发出警报并引导自动驾驶汽车，您一定想知道什么

2018
02:18:16,380 --> 02:18:22,700
 is the technology behind it well artificial intelligence is the basic principle that drives

2018
02:18:16,380 --> 02:18:22,700
背后的技术是好人工智能是驱动的基本原理

2019
02:18:22,700 --> 02:18:29,500
 object detection the idea is simple the data is collected through computer vision the data is then

2019
02:18:22,700 --> 02:18:29,500
物体检测 想法很简单 通过计算机视觉收集数据 然后将数据

2020
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:35,100
 fed into the model and using machine learning algorithms or deep learning algorithms inclusions

2020
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:35,100
输入模型并使用机器学习算法或深度学习算法包含

2021
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:41,020
 are made the camera collects the image from different angles and sends it to the image

2021
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:41,020
使得摄像头采集不同角度的图像并发送给图像

2022
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:48,380
 processing unit now based on how the model was trained and what the training data was the results

2022
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:48,380
处理单元现在基于模型的训练方式以及训练数据的结果

2023
02:18:48,459 --> 02:18:54,779
 are laid out to the system in the form of alerts or instructions like how far the object is if the

2023
02:18:48,459 --> 02:18:54,779
以警报或指令的形式向系统展示，例如如果物体

2024
02:18:54,779 --> 02:19:01,339
 object is moving or if the object has stopped object detection has also been paving a glorious

2024
02:18:54,779 --> 02:19:01,339
物体正在移动或者物体已经停止，物体检测也已经铺平了辉煌

2025
02:19:01,339 --> 02:19:08,139
 path for the surveillance industry traffic tracking systems activity recognition even sentiment

02:19:33,420 --> 02:19:40,300
nid varangal 将帮助您借助经验掌握此类先进的人工智能概念

2031
02:19:40,779 --> 02:19:47,340
 okay so therefore you can see from this video the objective of object detection is to try to

2031
02:19:40,779 --> 02:19:47,340
好的，因此您可以从这段视频中看到，对象检测的目标是尝试

2032
02:19:47,340 --> 02:19:52,779
 detect different instances of objects in the scene so there's actually object detection even though

2032
02:19:47,340 --> 02:19:52,779
检测场景中对象的不同实例，因此实际上存在对象检测，即使

2033
02:19:52,779 --> 02:19:59,099
 it's a more fundamental task but it actually also have various challenges for example you need to

2033
02:19:52,779 --> 02:19:59,099
这是一项更基本的任务，但实际上也面临着各种挑战，例如您需要

2034
02:19:59,099 --> 02:20:05,019
 be able to handle different imaging condition yeah different viewpoint now the size whether it's big

2034
02:19:59,099 --> 02:20:05,019
能够处理不同的成像条件是的，不同的视角，现在的尺寸是否大

2035
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:10,220
 object or small object sometimes different lighting condition for example currently i have one

2035
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:10,220
物体或小物体有时会有不同的照明条件，例如目前我有一个

2036
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:15,500
 particular project with a company so for this particular project we are trying to put some

2036
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:15,500
与一家公司合作的特定项目，因此对于这个特定项目，我们正在尝试投入一些

2037
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:23,740
 camera in the car cabin and try to you know analyze the you know the actions and the behaviors of the

2037
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:23,740
在车舱内安装摄像头并尝试分析您知道的动作和行为

2038
02:20:23,740 --> 02:20:29,100
 drivers as well as the passengers as well as detect different objects in the car so this could be used

2038
02:20:23,740 --> 02:20:29,100
驾驶员和乘客以及检测车内的不同物体，因此可以使用

2039
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:34,140
 for example in application for example the one that we mentioned in wuhan the

2039
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:34,140
例如在应用中，例如我们在武汉提到的那个

2040
02:20:34,140 --> 02:20:38,860
 low ball quite power right so if you go into the car you know if you try to scratch their car they

2040
02:20:34,140 --> 02:20:38,860
低球相当有力，所以如果你走进车里，你就知道如果你试图刮伤他们的车，他们

2041
02:20:38,860 --> 02:20:43,660
 will see that you're doing something that you're not supposed to be or you live behind something

2041
02:20:38,860 --> 02:20:43,660
会发现你正在做一些你不应该做的事情或者你生活在某些事情背后

2042
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:49,740
 they will actually alert you so yeah for example in car environment one of the challenge that you

2042
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:49,740
他们实际上会提醒您，是的，例如在汽车环境中，这是您面临的挑战之一

2043
02:20:49,740 --> 02:20:56,380
 have is the lighting condition yeah sometimes no it can be a bit too dark in the car environment

2043
02:20:49,740 --> 02:20:56,380
有的是照明条件 是的，有时没有，车内环境可能有点太暗

2044
02:20:56,380 --> 02:20:59,980
 so therefore you need to investigate different issues like using different

2044
02:20:56,380 --> 02:20:59,980
因此，您需要调查不同的问题，例如使用不同的

2045
02:21:00,939 --> 02:21:06,300
 sensing modality for example just now the camera that we talked about using the rgb camera as well

2045
02:21:00,939 --> 02:21:06,300
传感方式 例如刚才我们谈到的使用 RGB 相机的相机

2046
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:12,300
 as the no infrared okay near infrared capture this information and then try to fuse them

2046
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:12,300
因为没有红外线可以，近红外线捕获此信息，然后尝试融合它们

2047
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:16,859
 to help you to perform object detection as well as action recognition so therefore

2047
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:16,859
帮助您执行物体检测和动作识别，因此

2048
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:23,339
 there are actually still quite a lot of uh no challenges in problems such as object detection

2048
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:23,339
实际上在物体检测等问题上还有很多呃没有挑战

2049
02:21:27,179 --> 02:21:33,179
 okay so the next uh video that we are going to show is the object tracking so what's the meaning

2049
02:21:27,179 --> 02:21:33,179
好的，我们要展示的下一个视频是对象跟踪，这是什么意思

2050
02:21:33,179 --> 02:21:39,259
 of object tracking so we can yeah pretty much as the name suggests is that once you detect the object

2050
02:21:33,179 --> 02:21:39,259
物体跟踪，所以我们可以是的，顾名思义，一旦您检测到物体

2051
02:21:39,259 --> 02:21:44,699
 you want to track the movement of the object okay you want to track the movement so there's many

2051
02:21:39,259 --> 02:21:44,699
你想跟踪物体的运动 好吧，你想跟踪运动，所以有很多

2052
02:21:44,699 --> 02:21:51,580
 uh cases why you may want to do that for example for separate security application and so on yeah

2052
02:21:44,699 --> 02:21:51,580
呃，为什么你可能想要这样做，例如对于单独的安全应用程序等等是的

2053
02:21:51,580 --> 02:21:56,780
 yeah so let me just play you this short video on object tracking

2053
02:21:51,580 --> 02:21:56,780
是的，让我给你播放一段关于对象跟踪的短视频

2054
02:22:51,580 --> 02:22:54,780
 so

2054
02:22:51,580 --> 02:22:54,780
所以

2055
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:10,380
 okay yeah so for example now you can see from the video quite clearly what's the objective of the

2055
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:10,380
好的，是的，例如，现在您可以从视频中清楚地看到其目标是什么

2056
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:15,340
 object tracking is that you want to track the movement of the person so what are some common

2056
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:15,340
对象跟踪是你想要跟踪人的运动那么有哪些常见的

2057
02:23:15,340 --> 02:23:21,340
 challenges in this object tracking one common one is the occlusion if you're for example the

2057
02:23:15,340 --> 02:23:21,340
此对象跟踪中的挑战之一常见的挑战是遮挡，例如，如果您是

2058
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:27,260
 person you are trying to track they go you know behind a particular structure okay say this

2058
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:27,260
你试图追踪的人 他们是你认识的某个特定结构背后的人 好吧，这么说

2059
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:32,380
 building so part of my body now is obscured so when i move out and reappear can you still track

2059
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:32,380
建筑物现在我身体的一部分被遮挡了所以当我搬出去并重新出现时你还能追踪吗

2060
02:23:32,380 --> 02:23:36,940
 that it's the same person so these are some challenge other things include for example if

2060
02:23:32,380 --> 02:23:36,940
这是同一个人，所以这些是一些挑战，其他事情包括，例如，如果

2061
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:41,660
 you're a two person you know walking in opposite direction right and afterwards say suppose they

2061
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:41,660
你们认识两个人，朝相反的方向走，然后说假设他们

2062
02:23:41,660 --> 02:23:47,500
 cross over would you somehow switch the id the track number you would think that is now different

2062
02:23:41,660 --> 02:23:47,500
交叉你会以某种方式改变你认为现在不同的轨道编号吗

2063
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:52,860
 person or if these two person they meet here and afterwards they move separate in a separate way

2063
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:52,860
一个人，或者如果这两个人在这里相遇，然后他们以不同的方式分开

2064
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:57,580
 if you just follow the trajectory path you will thought that you know this person is becoming here

2064
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:57,580
如果你只是沿着轨迹路径走，你会认为你知道这个人正在成为这里

2065
02:23:57,580 --> 02:24:01,660
 and this person is becoming here but actually sometimes they could just meet and then they're

2065
02:23:57,580 --> 02:24:01,660
这个人正在成为这里，但实际上有时他们可以见面，然后他们就

2066
02:24:01,660 --> 02:24:07,820
 separate so therefore id switch the switch of different id is also a challenge in this object

2066
02:24:01,660 --> 02:24:07,820
分开所以id切换不同id的切换也是这个对象的一个​​挑战

2067
02:24:07,820 --> 02:24:15,180
 tracking right so let's continue to look at some of the other right okay so this video shows you

2067
02:24:07,820 --> 02:24:15,180
跟踪正确的所以让我们继续看看其他一些正确的好吧所以这个视频向您展示

2068
02:24:16,060 --> 02:24:21,820
 post estimation so post estimation pretty much means that you want to estimate the key point

2068
02:24:16,060 --> 02:24:21,820
事后估计所以事后估计几乎意味着你想要估计关键点

2069
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:28,220
 or the key important joint of the body so it can be a full body post estimation or it can be for

2069
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:28,220
或身体的关键重要关节，因此它可以是全身后估计，也可以是

2070
02:24:28,220 --> 02:24:33,260
 example your facial post estimation some of the key point on your face or some of the key point on

2070
02:24:28,220 --> 02:24:33,260
例如，你的脸部位置估计你脸上的一些关键点或身上的一些关键点

2071
02:24:33,260 --> 02:24:38,860
 your head so these are some a few different possible variations of the post estimation

2071
02:24:33,260 --> 02:24:38,860
你的头脑所以这些是事后估计的一些不同的可能变化

2072
02:24:39,820 --> 02:24:44,540
 so let me just play for you this short video

2072
02:24:39,820 --> 02:24:44,540
那么让我为你播放这个短片

2073
02:24:45,340 --> 02:24:46,220
 so

2073
02:24:45,340 --> 02:24:46,220
所以

2074
02:25:06,380 --> 02:25:10,220
 you can see it's trying to estimate all the important key points right

2074
02:25:06,380 --> 02:25:10,220
你可以看到它试图正确估计所有重要的关键点

2075
02:25:10,699 --> 02:25:15,900
 so once you estimate this important key point you can use to analyze the actions of the

2075
02:25:10,699 --> 02:25:15,900
因此，一旦您估计了这个重要的关键点，您就可以用来分析

2076
02:25:17,019 --> 02:25:23,820
 you know the person actually in gyms is a very natural no use case of post estimation

2076
02:25:17,019 --> 02:25:23,820
你知道，实际上在健身房里的人是一个非常自然的事后估计的用例

2077
02:25:23,820 --> 02:25:31,260
 I used to have one research staff right he he used to work in a project in uh Korea yeah and

2077
02:25:23,820 --> 02:25:31,260
我曾经有一名研究人员，他曾经在韩国的一个项目中工作，是的，

2078
02:25:31,260 --> 02:25:37,260
 they're actually doing exactly this which is using the post estimation to analyze the movement of the

2078
02:25:31,260 --> 02:25:37,260
他们实际上正在做这件事，即使用后估计来分析物体的运动

2079
02:25:37,260 --> 02:25:42,300
 of the person who do the workout in a gym yeah

2079
02:25:37,260 --> 02:25:42,300
在健身房锻炼的人是的

2080
02:26:07,740 --> 02:26:10,300
 so

2080
02:26:07,740 --> 02:26:10,300
所以

2081
02:26:14,300 --> 02:26:24,300
 they should bring a mattress then he can fold up a bit faster

2081
02:26:14,300 --> 02:26:24,300
他们应该带一个床垫，这样他就可以折叠得更快一点

2082
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:27,340
 oh

2082
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:27,340
哦

2083
02:26:34,779 --> 02:26:39,019
 yeah so in the past I still remember there was a project which is they're using a post estimation

2083
02:26:34,779 --> 02:26:39,019
是的，所以在过去，我仍然记得有一个项目，他们正在使用事后估算

2084
02:26:39,019 --> 02:26:44,939
 to do the uh Parkinson disease progression you know what's a Parkinson disease right

2084
02:26:39,019 --> 02:26:44,939
要了解帕金森病的进展情况，您知道什么是帕金森病吗？

2085
02:26:44,939 --> 02:26:51,900
 no Parkinson disease is characterized by no uh we start when you walk especially for old older

2085
02:26:44,939 --> 02:26:51,900
没有帕金森病的特点是没有呃我们从你走路的时候开始特别是对于老年人

2086
02:26:51,900 --> 02:26:58,140
 person when you walk actually your swing of the hand is asymmetric one hand swing normally the

2086
02:26:51,900 --> 02:26:58,140
当你走路的时候，你的手的摆动是不对称的，通常一只手摆动

2087
02:26:58,140 --> 02:27:02,940
 other hand doesn't swing a lot actually I also notice sometimes when I walk that's how I walk

2087
02:26:58,140 --> 02:27:02,940
另一只手实际上摆动幅度不大，有时我走路时也注意到这就是我走路的方式

2088
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:08,619
 so actually it can be used to analyze for example whether your Parkinson disease has deteriorated

2088
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:08,619
所以实际上它可以用来分析你的帕金森病是否恶化

2089
02:27:08,619 --> 02:27:19,340
 over time okay so the next one is actually on uh action recognition so action recognition for

2089
02:27:08,619 --> 02:27:19,340
随着时间的推移，好的，所以下一个实际上是呃动作识别，所以动作识别

2090
02:27:19,340 --> 02:27:25,340
 this video is mainly focusing on sports video but it can be a lot more for example in the context of

2090
02:27:19,340 --> 02:27:25,340
该视频主要关注体育视频，但也可以有更多内容，例如在

2091
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:32,060
 a factory uh kind of assembly task you can analyze whether this particular worker is performing what

2091
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:32,060
工厂呃一种装配任务，你可以分析这个特定的工人是否正在执行什么

2092
02:27:32,060 --> 02:27:38,380
 task whether it's tightening tightening a nuts no applying some screw and so on so currently we are

2092
02:27:32,060 --> 02:27:38,380
任务是否是拧紧螺母，是否使用螺钉等等，所以目前我们正在

2093
02:27:38,380 --> 02:27:46,540
 also uh no discussing with a uh a company right to know uh try to perform this action recognition

2093
02:27:38,380 --> 02:27:46,540
也呃不与呃公司讨论有权知道呃尝试执行此行动认可

2094
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:53,740
 for worker who is trying to perform some assembly tasks yeah so uh but for this video is for a sports video

2094
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:53,740
对于试图执行一些组装任务的工人来说是的，但是这个视频是体育视频

2095
02:28:09,740 --> 02:28:13,900
 right so there are different action whether it's like you know dribbling the balls

2095
02:28:09,740 --> 02:28:13,900
是的，所以无论是像你知道的运球一样，都有不同的动作

2096
02:28:13,980 --> 02:28:19,820
 no whether it's like no trying to block no and and so on so there's a different actions

2096
02:28:13,980 --> 02:28:19,820
否 是否类似于“否”试图阻止“否”等等，因此有不同的操作

2097
02:28:20,619 --> 02:28:25,740
 for this particular sports video okay but in general case of course it can be a lot broader

2097
02:28:20,619 --> 02:28:25,740
对于这个特定的体育视频，好的，但在一般情况下，当然它可以更广泛

2098
02:28:25,740 --> 02:28:30,619
 okay like the one that I mentioned trying to analyze different actions in assembly tasks

2098
02:28:25,740 --> 02:28:30,619
好的，就像我提到的尝试分析装配任务中的不同操作一样

2099
02:28:30,619 --> 02:28:35,580
 or in a more generous setting to try out find out whether you are drinking water you're walking

2099
02:28:30,619 --> 02:28:35,580
或者在更慷慨的环境中尝试看看您是否在步行时喝水

2100
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:38,380
 no or you are smoking and so on

2100
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:38,380
不，或者你正在吸烟等等

2101
02:28:42,220 --> 02:28:49,740
 okay so the next uh video this one is called egocentric human object interactions so egocentric

2101
02:28:42,220 --> 02:28:49,740
好吧，下一个呃视频这个叫做以自我为中心的人类对象交互所以以自我为中心

2102
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:55,100
 means that is no the viewpoint is like the human viewpoint the first person perspective viewpoint

2102
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:55,100
意思是没有像人类的观点一样的观点第一人称视角观点

2103
02:28:55,100 --> 02:29:01,100
 and human object interaction as the name suggests the interaction between human and objects so in

2103
02:28:55,100 --> 02:29:01,100
人与物交互，顾名思义就是人与物体之间的交互，所以在

2104
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:07,020
 many of the tasks are when the worker is trying to learn something at the form certain tasks

2104
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:07,020
许多任务是当工人试图从某些任务中学习一些东西时

2105
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:12,860
 you know we need to understand what the worker is doing right how does it manipulate the objects

2105
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:12,860
你知道我们需要了解工人正在做什么，它是如何操纵对象的

2106
02:29:12,860 --> 02:29:20,220
 and so on so this is also one topic which is known as an egocentric human object interaction

2106
02:29:12,860 --> 02:29:20,220
等等，这也是一个被称为以自我为中心的人机交互的主题

2107
02:29:21,099 --> 02:29:22,140
 okay

2107
02:29:21,099 --> 02:29:22,140
好的

2108
02:29:22,140 --> 02:29:25,019
 it's from interactions between hands with objects

2108
02:29:22,140 --> 02:29:25,019
它来自于手与物体之间的相互作用

2109
02:29:30,779 --> 02:29:35,820
 audio can be a prime discriminator for actions such as washing or frying

2109
02:29:30,779 --> 02:29:35,820
音频可以成为洗涤或煎炸等动作的主要鉴别因素

2110
02:29:40,619 --> 02:29:44,699
 it can also differentiate between objects within actions such as

2110
02:29:40,619 --> 02:29:44,699
它还可以区分动作中的对象，例如

2111
02:29:44,699 --> 02:29:47,179
 putting a plate versus putting a bag

2111
02:29:44,699 --> 02:29:47,179
放盘子与放袋子

2112
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:56,779
 okay audio captures sounds of actions out of the camera's field of view such as eating

2112
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:56,779
好的音频可以捕获相机视野之外的动作声音，例如吃饭的声音

2113
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:03,099
 but can also capture irrelevant background music

2113
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:03,099
但也可以捕捉不相关的背景音乐

2114
02:30:09,820 --> 02:30:18,859
 we propose mid-level fusion of three modalities rgb flow and audio for audio we extract the raw

2114
02:30:09,820 --> 02:30:18,859
我们建议对三种模式 RGB 流和音频进行中级融合，我们提取原始音频

2115
02:30:18,860 --> 02:30:24,140
 waveform from the sound stream of the video which we transform into a spectrogram

2115
02:30:18,860 --> 02:30:24,140
我们将视频声音流中的波形转换为频谱图

2116
02:30:25,180 --> 02:30:30,140
 convolutional features are pooled and mid-level fusion is learned through feature concatenation

2116
02:30:25,180 --> 02:30:30,140
卷积特征被池化，并通过特征串联学习中层融合

2117
02:30:31,260 --> 02:30:37,820
 we learn the action as multitask verb and noun classifiers importantly we train using

2117
02:30:31,260 --> 02:30:37,820
我们将动作学习为多任务动词和名词分类器，重要的是我们使用

2118
02:30:37,820 --> 02:30:43,980
 asynchronous fusion we fuse modalities with a range of temporal offsets within a temporal

2118
02:30:37,820 --> 02:30:43,980
异步融合我们将模态与时间范围内的一系列时间偏移融合在一起

2119
02:30:43,980 --> 02:30:49,260
 binding window evidence in neuroscience points to the presence of such temporal

2119
02:30:43,980 --> 02:30:49,260
神经科学中的结合窗口证据表明这种时间的存在

2120
02:30:49,260 --> 02:30:55,740
 binding windows across sensory input in humans within each binding window modality samples are

2120
02:30:49,260 --> 02:30:55,740
每个结合窗口模态样本内跨人类感觉输入的结合窗口是

2121
02:30:55,740 --> 02:31:01,900
 randomly selected tbw's are sparsely sampled within the action and could be overlapping

2121
02:30:55,740 --> 02:31:01,900
随机选择的 tbw 在动作中稀疏采样并且可能重叠

2122
02:31:02,859 --> 02:31:08,859
 predictions are temporally aggregated by averaging to obtain video level multimodal predictions

2122
02:31:02,859 --> 02:31:08,859
通过平均来临时聚合预测以获得视频级多模态预测

2123
02:31:09,820 --> 02:31:16,220
 importantly we first bind and fuse modalities within windows before temporal aggregation of

2123
02:31:09,820 --> 02:31:16,220
重要的是，我们首先在窗口内绑定和融合模态，然后再进行时间聚合

2124
02:31:16,220 --> 02:31:23,500
 different windows tbn is trained end to end where all modalities are trained simultaneously

2124
02:31:16,220 --> 02:31:23,500
不同的窗口 tbn 进行端到端训练，所有模式同时训练

2125
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:29,900
 and the weights are shared over time we next present qualitative results of tbn on the epic

2125
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:29,900
并且权重随着时间的推移而共享，接下来我们将展示 tbn 在史诗中的定性结果

2126
02:31:29,900 --> 02:31:38,940
 kitchens data set

2126
02:31:29,900 --> 02:31:38,940
厨房数据集

2127
02:31:59,900 --> 02:32:08,940
 so

2127
02:31:59,900 --> 02:32:08,940
所以

2128
02:32:29,980 --> 02:32:38,940
 so

2128
02:32:29,980 --> 02:32:38,940
所以

2129
02:32:40,619 --> 02:32:52,940
 so

2129
02:32:40,619 --> 02:32:52,940
所以

2130
02:32:59,980 --> 02:33:02,940
 so

2130
02:32:59,980 --> 02:33:02,940
所以

2131
02:33:16,699 --> 02:33:23,660
 okay yeah so this is one of the earlier works that was done to perform human object interaction

2131
02:33:16,699 --> 02:33:23,660
好的，是的，这是为执行人类对象交互而完成的早期作品之一

2132
02:33:23,660 --> 02:33:28,699
 actually this human object interaction is very difficult to do it's still very challenging

2132
02:33:23,660 --> 02:33:28,699
实际上这种人机交互很难做到，仍然很有挑战性

2133
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:34,220
 because there's a lot of challenges for example you need to perform action detection or temporal

2133
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:34,220
因为存在很多挑战，例如您需要执行动作检测或时间

2134
02:33:34,220 --> 02:33:40,300
 video segmentation right from what you see that actually no a lot of the earlier for example action

2134
02:33:34,220 --> 02:33:40,300
从您所看到的来看，视频分割实际上没有很多早期的示例动作

2135
02:33:40,300 --> 02:33:46,220
 recognitions are usually the video we chop it into small segments okay and then for each of the video

2135
02:33:40,300 --> 02:33:46,220
识别通常是我们将视频切成小段，然后针对每个视频

2136
02:33:46,220 --> 02:33:53,500
 segment we try to you know classify what kind of action it is but for a continuous video like this

2136
02:33:46,220 --> 02:33:53,500
我们试图让您知道这是什么类型的动作，但是对于像这样的连续视频

2137
02:33:53,980 --> 02:33:58,460
 given a particular video you need to divide into different segments so that different

2137
02:33:53,980 --> 02:33:58,460
给定一个特定的视频，您需要分成不同的片段，以便不同的片段

2138
02:33:58,460 --> 02:34:04,060
 segments actually correspond to different action so that particular task is known as a temporal

2138
02:33:58,460 --> 02:34:04,060
片段实际上对应于不同的动作，因此特定的任务被称为时间

2139
02:34:04,060 --> 02:34:10,940
 video segmentation so that one even to do that to nicely cut it into different video segment

2139
02:34:04,060 --> 02:34:10,940
视频分割，这样就可以将其很好地切割成不同的视频片段

2140
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:15,740
 in itself is already a challenge and also from just now you can see the video when the person

2140
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:15,740
本身就已经是一个挑战，而且从刚才开始，你可以看到视频中的人

2141
02:34:15,740 --> 02:34:20,860
 is doing some tasks there's lots of noise sometimes he will just move around and then go and do

2141
02:34:15,740 --> 02:34:20,860
正在做一些任务，有很多噪音，有时他会四处走动，然后就去做

2142
02:34:20,860 --> 02:34:26,620
 something else and we come back so how do we recognize those actions are not of interest to

2142
02:34:20,860 --> 02:34:26,620
别的事情，我们回来了，那么我们如何认识到这些行为是不感兴趣的

2143
02:34:26,620 --> 02:34:32,220
 us and they are noise yeah so there's also for example when you're dealing with this object in

2143
02:34:26,620 --> 02:34:32,220
我们和他们都是噪音，是的，所以还有例如当你在处理这个对象时

2144
02:34:32,220 --> 02:34:38,300
 real life there's lots of background clutters and you know different objects that is not interested

2144
02:34:32,220 --> 02:34:38,300
现实生活中有很多杂乱的背景，并且你知道不同的不感兴趣的对象

2145
02:34:38,860 --> 02:34:44,460
 that you are not interested in so it's in short this is still a very difficult and challenging problem

2145
02:34:38,860 --> 02:34:44,460
你不感兴趣所以总之这仍然是一个非常困难和具有挑战性的问题

2146
02:34:44,699 --> 02:34:51,099
 okay so next I'll just very briefly talk about some of the emerging topics right so in

2146
02:34:44,699 --> 02:34:51,099
好的，接下来我将非常简短地讨论一些新兴主题，所以在

2147
02:34:51,099 --> 02:34:57,980
 recent years of course generative AI is becoming very you know important so I think many of you

2147
02:34:51,099 --> 02:34:57,980
当然，近年来，生成式人工智能变得非常重要，所以我想你们中的许多人

2148
02:34:57,980 --> 02:35:03,740
 probably have seen like chat gbt whereas you can generate the new content it can become a chat box

2148
02:34:57,980 --> 02:35:03,740
可能见过像聊天 GBT 这样的东西，你可以生成新的内容，它可以成为一个聊天框

2149
02:35:03,740 --> 02:35:08,779
 it can become an assistant you can interact with them in a very natural way other things like

2149
02:35:03,740 --> 02:35:08,779
它可以成为一个助手，您可以以非常自然的方式与他们互动，例如

2150
02:35:08,780 --> 02:35:15,100
 them in a very natural way other things like you know for example image generation so how many of

2150
02:35:08,780 --> 02:35:15,100
它们以一种非常自然的方式，像你知道的其他事情，例如图像生成，那么有多少

2151
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:23,020
 you have used some image generation tools like you know mid-journey or stable diffusion

2151
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:23,020
您使用过一些图像生成工具，例如您所知道的中途或稳定扩散

2152
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:30,940
 yeah I can see a few person raising their hand so you can see no reason in recent year right if

2152
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:30,940
是的，我可以看到有几个人举手，所以你看不出近年来有什么原因，如果

2153
02:35:30,940 --> 02:35:38,460
 you want to generate text generate image this is actually a very hot topic in uh in recent year

2153
02:35:30,940 --> 02:35:38,460
你想要生成文本生成图像这实际上是呃近年来非常热门的话题

2154
02:35:38,460 --> 02:35:44,060
 because in the past in the past for AI it tends to be discriminative right in other words for

2154
02:35:38,460 --> 02:35:44,060
因为过去对于人工智能来说它往往是歧视性的，换句话说对于

2155
02:35:44,060 --> 02:35:50,539
 example in the past AI tends to try to classify an image or video into this category or that

2155
02:35:44,060 --> 02:35:50,539
过去的例子人工智能倾向于尝试将图像或视频分类为这个类别或那个类别

2156
02:35:50,539 --> 02:35:58,539
 category so they cannot generate new content but in recent year right no uh this in I think year

2156
02:35:50,539 --> 02:35:58,539
类别，因此他们无法生成新内容，但近年来，不，呃，我认为这一年

2157
02:35:58,539 --> 02:36:03,980
 2018 forwards this generative AI is becoming very important because it can generate new content

2157
02:35:58,539 --> 02:36:03,980
2018年，这种生成式人工智能变得非常重要，因为它可以生成新内容

2158
02:36:04,539 --> 02:36:10,300
 so generative AI is a class of model that can generate new content such as a text image audio

2158
02:36:04,539 --> 02:36:10,300
所以生成式人工智能是一类可以生成新内容（例如文本图像音频）的模型

2159
02:36:10,859 --> 02:36:16,300
 okay and so on so if you are referring to for example text generation one very popular model is

2159
02:36:10,859 --> 02:36:16,300
好的等等，如果您指的是文本生成，一个非常流行的模型是

2160
02:36:16,300 --> 02:36:23,900
 the gbt generative pre-trained transformer okay so for this course we will also touch on this a

2160
02:36:16,300 --> 02:36:23,900
GBT 生成式预训练变压器 好的，所以在本课程中我们还将涉及这一点

2161
02:36:23,900 --> 02:36:29,580
 little bit later okay and then for image generation uh no a well-known technique is a stable diffusion

2161
02:36:23,900 --> 02:36:29,580
稍后，好吧，然后进行图像生成，嗯，不，众所周知的技术是稳定扩散

2162
02:36:30,380 --> 02:36:35,740
 okay so it support various types of application like chat box you ask question they will answer

2162
02:36:30,380 --> 02:36:35,740
好的，它支持各种类型的应用程序，例如聊天框，您提出问题他们会回答

2163
02:36:35,740 --> 02:36:42,539
 you okay content uh generation for example you can use the transformer to ask them to write a novel

2163
02:36:35,740 --> 02:36:42,539
你可以内容呃一代例如你可以使用变压器要求他们写一本小说

2164
02:36:42,539 --> 02:36:49,980
 write a story okay and virtual assistant for those of you who have watched uh this interaction the

2164
02:36:42,539 --> 02:36:49,980
写一个故事好吧，为那些看过这个互动的人提供虚拟助手

2165
02:36:49,980 --> 02:36:56,460
 recent uh chat gb this gbt 4o you will know that no you can actually interact with them in a very

2165
02:36:49,980 --> 02:36:56,460
最近呃聊天 gb 这个 gbt 4o 你会知道，不，你实际上可以以非常好的方式与他们互动

2166
02:36:56,939 --> 02:37:04,380
 natural way right so another kind of a very important emerging direction in recent year

2166
02:36:56,939 --> 02:37:04,380
自然的方式是正确的，所以近年来另一种非常重要的新兴方向

2167
02:37:04,380 --> 02:37:09,980
 is the idea of this foundation model so what's the foundation model so foundation model is a

2167
02:37:04,380 --> 02:37:09,980
是这个基础模型的想法 那么什么是基础模型 所以基础模型是

2168
02:37:09,980 --> 02:37:16,859
 class of model that are trained on large scale broad data that can be adapted or fine-tuned to

2168
02:37:09,980 --> 02:37:16,859
在大规模广泛数据上进行训练的模型类别，可以调整或微调

2169
02:37:16,859 --> 02:37:22,779
 wide range of downstream tasks or application so in a more traditional way you know in the past

2169
02:37:16,859 --> 02:37:22,779
广泛的下游任务或应用程序，因此以您过去知道的更传统的方式

2170
02:37:22,780 --> 02:37:28,620
 when people want to say suppose they want to solve a particular problem what they need to do

2170
02:37:22,780 --> 02:37:28,620
当人们想说假设他们想解决某个特定问题时他们需要做什么

2171
02:37:28,620 --> 02:37:34,300
 for example if you want to recognize different plants in singapore right so suppose if you join

2171
02:37:28,620 --> 02:37:34,300
例如，如果您想识别新加坡的不同植物，那么假设您加入

2172
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:40,620
 a company and the company asks you to develop a mobile app that can recognize different plants

2172
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:40,620
一家公司和公司要求你开发一个可以识别不同植物的移动应用程序

2173
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:46,620
 in singapore what do you have to do so if you think about it so what it means likely is that

2173
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:46,620
在新加坡你必须做什么如果你想一想那么这可能意味着

2174
02:37:46,620 --> 02:37:52,620
 you have to go and collect some you know images your plant images in singapore and then you have

2174
02:37:46,620 --> 02:37:52,620
你必须去收集一些你知道的图像，你在新加坡的植物图像，然后你就有了

2175
02:37:52,620 --> 02:38:00,060
 to employ an expert to tell you what this different you know categories of plants it is and afterwards

2175
02:37:52,620 --> 02:38:00,060
聘请专家告诉您您所知道的植物类别是什么，然后

2176
02:38:00,060 --> 02:38:04,460
 you need to spend lots of money to do that collection annotation and afterwards you need

2176
02:38:00,060 --> 02:38:04,460
你需要花很多钱来做这个集合注释，然后你需要

2177
02:38:04,460 --> 02:38:12,540
 to train this model from the scratch to develop your uh plan recognition or classification algorithm

2177
02:38:04,460 --> 02:38:12,540
从头开始训练该模型以开发您的呃计划识别或分类算法

2178
02:38:12,540 --> 02:38:17,820
 so that's in the past that means for each problems that you have you need to collect the data set

2178
02:38:12,540 --> 02:38:17,820
所以这已经过去了，这意味着对于您遇到的每个问题，您都需要收集数据集

2179
02:38:17,820 --> 02:38:24,060
 you need to train a AI model and then afterwards then you can deploy it so different use case you

2179
02:38:17,820 --> 02:38:24,060
你需要训练一个人工智能模型，然后你可以部署它，这样你就可以在不同的用例中

2180
02:38:24,060 --> 02:38:29,660
 need to collect different data set and you need to train a new model so this of course you can see

2180
02:38:24,060 --> 02:38:29,660
需要收集不同的数据集，并且需要训练一个新模型，因此您当然可以看到

2181
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:36,300
 it's very expensive because data collection you know is very expensive and annotation is very

2181
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:36,300
它非常昂贵，因为您知道数据收集非常昂贵并且注释非常昂贵

2182
02:38:36,300 --> 02:38:41,420
 expensive so this foundation model is basically based on this idea is that you're going to train

2182
02:38:36,300 --> 02:38:41,420
昂贵，所以这个基础模型基本上基于这个想法，就是你要训练

2183
02:38:41,420 --> 02:38:48,460
 on a very large scale data so this large scale data can be billions of images right it's broad

2183
02:38:41,420 --> 02:38:48,460
在非常大规模的数据上，所以这种大规模数据可以是数十亿张图像，它很广泛

2184
02:38:48,460 --> 02:38:54,940
 data that means you try to train over a wide range of different types of data okay and afterwards

2184
02:38:48,460 --> 02:38:54,940
数据意味着您尝试训练各种不同类型的数据，然后就可以了

2185
02:38:54,940 --> 02:39:00,940
 once you have fully trained it you can then use it to adapt or do it some fine tuning so that you can

2185
02:38:54,940 --> 02:39:00,940
一旦你完全训练了它，你就可以用它来适应或做一些微调，这样你就可以

2186
02:39:00,940 --> 02:39:07,420
 then use it to deploy for your specific application yeah so that's the high level idea so you can see

2186
02:39:00,940 --> 02:39:07,420
然后用它来部署您的特定应用程序是的，这是高级想法，您可以看到

2187
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:14,220
 this is the high level idea you have lots of data right it's a large scale broad data you use it to

2187
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:14,220
这是一个高层次的想法，你拥有大量数据，这是你用它来处理的大规模广泛数据

2188
02:39:14,220 --> 02:39:20,060
 train a very big foundation model so this foundation model is very big you have seen many different

2188
02:39:14,220 --> 02:39:20,060
训练一个非常大的基础模型所以这个基础模型非常大你已经看到了很多不同的

2189
02:39:20,060 --> 02:39:25,500
 things already so afterwards once you have this foundation model depending on what is your

2189
02:39:20,060 --> 02:39:25,500
一旦你有了这个基础模型，事情就已经如此，这取决于你的

2190
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:31,740
 downstream application you can then use it to do some adaptation or simple fine tuning right

2190
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:31,740
然后，您可以使用下游应用程序进行一些调整或简单的微调

2191
02:39:32,460 --> 02:39:38,780
 so that you can then use it to address some specific problem so therefore this foundation

2191
02:39:32,460 --> 02:39:38,780
这样你就可以用它来解决一些特定的问题，因此这个基础

2192
02:39:38,780 --> 02:39:44,860
 model in recent years is actually past one or two years is becoming very important okay and many

2192
02:39:38,780 --> 02:39:44,860
近年来的模型实际上过去一两年变得非常重要，好吧，很多

2193
02:39:44,860 --> 02:39:51,420
 people are trying to spend time to develop this different way for example to adapt your big

2193
02:39:44,860 --> 02:39:51,420
人们试图花时间来开发这种不同的方式，例如适应你的大

2194
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:57,420
 foundation model so some examples of foundation models are large language model for example gpt

2194
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:57,420
基础模型，因此基础模型的一些示例是大型语言模型，例如 gpt

2195
02:39:57,420 --> 02:40:02,700
 that we have seen and vision language model model that combine the vision and the language

2195
02:39:57,420 --> 02:40:02,700
我们看到的视觉语言模型是视觉和语言相结合的模型

2196
02:40:02,700 --> 02:40:05,340
 so a very well known example is the clip model

2196
02:40:02,700 --> 02:40:05,340
所以一个非常著名的例子是剪辑模型

2197
02:40:08,860 --> 02:40:14,140
 okay so next we have a short video actually the video is long but i'm not going to play the

2197
02:40:08,860 --> 02:40:14,140
好的，接下来我们有一个短视频，实际上视频很长，但我不会播放

2198
02:40:14,140 --> 02:40:19,820
 whole video i just play a short segment right just to give you a feel know how is the current

2198
02:40:14,140 --> 02:40:19,820
整个视频我只播放一小段，只是为了让大家感受一下当前情况如何

2199
02:40:19,820 --> 02:40:25,100
 train right as well as some background in generative ai and foundation model so let me just play this

2199
02:40:19,820 --> 02:40:25,100
正确训练以及生成人工智能和基础模型的一些背景，所以让我玩这个

2200
02:40:25,100 --> 02:40:34,460
 particular video for you

2200
02:40:25,100 --> 02:40:34,460
为您准备的特别视频

2201
02:40:40,300 --> 02:40:45,180
 ever since computers were invented they've really just been glorified calculators machines that

2201
02:40:40,300 --> 02:40:45,180
自从计算机被发明以来，它们实际上只是被美化的计算器机器

2202
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:49,580
 execute the exact instructions given to them by the programmers but something incredible is

2202
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:49,580
执行程序员给他们的确切指令，但令人难以置信的是

2203
02:40:49,580 --> 02:40:54,860
 happening now computers have started gaining the ability to learn and think and communicate

2203
02:40:49,580 --> 02:40:54,860
现在发生的事情计算机已经开始获得学习、思考和交流的能力

2204
02:40:54,860 --> 02:40:59,820
 just like we do they can do creative intellectual work that previously only humans could do we call

2204
02:40:54,860 --> 02:40:59,820
就像我们一样，他们可以做以前只有人类才能做的创造性智力工作，我们称之为

2205
02:40:59,820 --> 02:41:04,620
 this technology generative ai and you may have encountered it already through products like chat

2205
02:40:59,820 --> 02:41:04,620
这项技术是生成式人工智能，您可能已经通过聊天等产品遇到过它

2206
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:13,260
 gpt basically intelligence is now available as a service kind of like a giant

2206
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:13,260
gpt 基本上智能现在可以作为一种服务使用，就像一个巨人一样

2207
02:41:25,020 --> 02:41:31,020
 sky that anyone can talk to it's not perfect but it is surprisingly capable and it is improving

2207
02:41:25,020 --> 02:41:31,020
任何人都可以与之交谈的天空它并不完美，但它的能力令人惊讶，并且正在不断改进

2208
02:41:31,020 --> 02:41:37,500
 at an exponential rate this is a big deal it's going to affect just about every person and company

2208
02:41:31,020 --> 02:41:37,500
以指数级的速度，这是一件大事，它将影响到几乎每个人和公司

2209
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:42,940
 on the planet positively or negatively this video is here to help you understand what generative ai

2209
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:42,940
这个视频的目的是帮助您了解生成式人工智能对地球的积极或消极影响

2210
02:41:42,940 --> 02:41:48,460
 is all about in practical terms beyond the hype the better you understand this technology as a

2210
02:41:42,940 --> 02:41:48,460
从实际角度来看，这一切都超出了炒作，您对这项技术的了解越深入

2211
02:41:48,460 --> 02:41:53,580
 person team or company the better equipped you will be to survive and thrive in the age of ai

2211
02:41:48,460 --> 02:41:53,580
个人、团队或公司越有能力在人工智能时代生存和发展

2212
02:41:54,539 --> 02:42:00,460
 so here's the silly but useful mental model for this you have einstein in your basement in

2212
02:41:54,539 --> 02:42:00,460
所以这是一个愚蠢但有用的心理模型，你的地下室里有爱因斯坦

2213
02:42:00,460 --> 02:42:06,460
 fact everyone does and by einstein i really mean the combination of every smart person who ever

2213
02:42:00,460 --> 02:42:06,460
事实上每个人都这样做，爱因斯坦的意思是每个聪明人的结合

2214
02:42:06,460 --> 02:42:11,980
 lived you can talk to einstein whenever you want he has instant access to the sum of all human

2214
02:42:06,460 --> 02:42:11,980
只要你愿意，你就可以随时与爱因斯坦交谈，他可以立即获得全人类的总和

2215
02:42:11,980 --> 02:42:17,180
 knowledge and will answer anything you want within seconds never running out of patience he can also

2215
02:42:11,980 --> 02:42:17,180
知识，并会在几秒钟内回答你想要的任何问题，永远不会失去耐心，他也可以

2216
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:23,900
 take on any role you want a comedian poet doctor coach and will be an expert within that field

2216
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:23,900
扮演任何你想要的角色喜剧演员诗人医生教练并将成为该领域的专家

2217
02:42:24,700 --> 02:42:30,060
 he has some human-like limitations though he can make mistakes he can jump to conclusions he can

2217
02:42:24,700 --> 02:42:30,060
他有一些像人类一样的局限性，尽管他会犯错误，但他可以仓促下结论

2218
02:42:30,060 --> 02:42:35,340
 misunderstand you but the biggest limitation is actually your imagination and your ability to

2218
02:42:30,060 --> 02:42:35,340
误解你，但最大的限制其实是你的想象力和你的能力

2219
02:42:35,340 --> 02:42:41,820
 communicate effectively with him this skill is known as prompt engineering and in the age of ai

2219
02:42:35,340 --> 02:42:41,820
与他进行有效的沟通，这项技能被称为快速工程，在人工智能时代

2220
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:48,220
 this is as essential as reading and writing most people vastly underestimate what this einstein

2220
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:48,220
这与阅读和写作一样重要，大多数人都大大低估了爱因斯坦的能力

2221
02:42:48,220 --> 02:42:53,580
 in your basement can do it's like going to the real einstein and asking him to proofread a high

2221
02:42:48,220 --> 02:42:53,580
在你的地下室可以做到这就像去真正的爱因斯坦并请他校对一个高

2222
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:59,180
 school report or hiring a world-class five-star chef and having him chop onions the more you

2222
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:59,180
学校报告或聘请世界一流的五星级厨师并让他切洋葱越多

2223
02:42:59,180 --> 02:43:04,460
 interact with einstein the more you will discover surprising and powerful ways for him to help you

2223
02:42:59,180 --> 02:43:04,460
与爱因斯坦互动越多，你就会发现他以令人惊讶和强大的方式来帮助你

2224
02:43:04,460 --> 02:43:11,260
 or your company okay enough fluffy metaphors let's clarify some terms ai as you probably know stands

2224
02:43:04,460 --> 02:43:11,260
或者你的公司好吧，足够蓬松的隐喻让我们澄清一些你可能知道的术语人工智能

2225
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:16,780
 for artificial intelligence ai is not new feels like machine learning and computer vision have

2225
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:16,780
对于人工智能来说，人工智能并不新鲜，就像机器学习和计算机视觉一样

2226
02:43:16,780 --> 02:43:22,220
 been around for decades whenever you see a youtube recommendation or a web search result or whenever

2226
02:43:16,780 --> 02:43:22,220
几十年来，每当您看到 YouTube 推荐或网络搜索结果或每当

2227
02:43:22,220 --> 02:43:28,700
 you get a credit card transaction approved that's traditional ai in action generative ai is ai that

2227
02:43:22,220 --> 02:43:28,700
你得到了一笔信用卡交易的批准，这是传统的人工智能在行动，生成式人工智能是人工智能

2228
02:43:28,700 --> 02:43:34,540
 generates new original content rather than just finding or classifying existing content that's the

2228
02:43:28,700 --> 02:43:34,540
生成新的原始内容，而不仅仅是查找或分类现有内容

2229
02:43:34,540 --> 02:43:41,980
 g and gpt for example large language models or lms are a type of generative ai that can communicate

2229
02:43:34,540 --> 02:43:41,980
g 和 gpt 例如大型语言模型或 lms 是一种可以交流的生成人工智能

2230
02:43:41,980 --> 02:43:49,260
 using normal human language chat gpt is a product by the company open ai it started as an lm

2230
02:43:41,980 --> 02:43:49,260
使用正常的人类语言聊天 gpt 是 open ai 公司的产品，它最初是作为 lm 开始的

2231
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:53,980
 essentially an advanced chat bot using a new architecture called the transformer architecture

2231
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:53,980
本质上是一个高级聊天机器人，使用称为变压器架构的新架构

2232
02:43:53,980 --> 02:44:00,220
 which by the way is the t and gpt it is so fluent at human language that anyone can use it you don't

2232
02:43:53,980 --> 02:44:00,220
顺便说一句，这是 t 和 gpt，它对人类语言非常流利，任何人都可以使用它，而你却不会

2233
02:44:00,220 --> 02:44:04,380
 need to be an ai expert or programmer and that's kind of what triggered the whole revolution

2233
02:44:00,220 --> 02:44:04,380
需要成为人工智能专家或程序员，这就是引发整个革命的原因

2234
02:44:05,340 --> 02:44:11,980
 so how does it actually work well a large language model is an artificial neural network basically a

2234
02:44:05,340 --> 02:44:11,980
那么它实际上是如何运作良好的一个大型语言模型是一个人工神经网络，基本上是一个

2235
02:44:11,980 --> 02:44:17,019
 bunch of numbers or parameters connected to each other similar to how our brain is a bunch of

2235
02:44:11,980 --> 02:44:17,019
一堆相互连接的数字或参数，类似于我们的大脑是一堆

2236
02:44:17,019 --> 02:44:21,900
 neurons or brain cells connected to each other neural networks only deal with numbers you send

2236
02:44:17,019 --> 02:44:21,900
相互连接的神经元或脑细胞神经网络仅处理您发送的数字

2237
02:44:21,900 --> 02:44:26,699
 in numbers and depending on how the parameters are set all the numbers come out but any kind of

2237
02:44:21,900 --> 02:44:26,699
在数字中，根据参数的设置方式，所有数字都会出来，但任何类型的

2238
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:33,180
 content such as text or images can be represented as numbers so let's say i write dogs are when i

2238
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:33,180
文本或图像等内容可以表示为数字，所以假设我写狗是当我

2239
02:44:33,180 --> 02:44:37,820
 send that to a large language model that gets converted to numbers processed by the neural

2239
02:44:33,180 --> 02:44:37,820
将其发送到大型语言模型，该模型将转换为由神经网络处理的数字

2240
02:44:37,820 --> 02:44:42,300
 network and then the resulting numbers are converted back into text in this case the word

2240
02:44:37,820 --> 02:44:42,300
网络，然后将结果数字转换回文本，在本例中为单词

2241
02:44:42,300 --> 02:44:49,500
 animals dogs are animals so yeah this is basically a guess the next word machine the interesting part

2241
02:44:42,300 --> 02:44:49,500
动物 狗是动物所以是的这基本上是一个猜测下一个单词机器有趣的部分

2242
02:44:49,500 --> 02:44:55,180
 is if we take that output and combine it with input and send it through the model again then

2242
02:44:49,500 --> 02:44:55,180
就是如果我们获取该输出并将其与输入组合并再次通过模型发送它

2243
02:44:55,180 --> 02:44:59,260
 it will continue adding new words that's what's going on behind the scenes when you type something

2243
02:44:55,180 --> 02:44:59,260
它会继续添加新单词，这就是您输入内容时幕后发生的事情

2244
02:44:59,260 --> 02:45:05,580
 in chat gpt in this case for example it generated a whole story and i can continue this indefinitely

2244
02:44:59,260 --> 02:45:05,580
例如，在聊天 gpt 中，它生成了一个完整的故事，我可以无限期地继续这个故事

2245
02:45:05,580 --> 02:45:12,380
 by adding more prompts a large language model may have billions or even trillions of parameters

2245
02:45:05,580 --> 02:45:12,380
通过添加更多提示，大型语言模型可能拥有数十亿甚至数万亿个参数

2246
02:45:12,380 --> 02:45:17,660
 that's why they're called large so how are all these numbers set well not through manual

2246
02:45:12,380 --> 02:45:17,660
这就是为什么它们被称为大的原因，那么所有这些数字如何不通过手动设置好

2247
02:45:17,660 --> 02:45:23,900
 programming that would be impossible but through training just like babies learning to speak a

2247
02:45:17,660 --> 02:45:23,900
编程是不可能的，但通过训练就像婴儿学习说话一样

2248
02:45:23,900 --> 02:45:29,340
 baby isn't told how to speak she doesn't get an instruction manual instead she listens to people

2248
02:45:23,900 --> 02:45:29,340
婴儿没有被告知如何说话，她没有得到指导手册，而是听别人说话

2249
02:45:29,340 --> 02:45:34,060
 speaking around her and when she's heard enough she starts seeing the pattern she speaks a few

2249
02:45:29,340 --> 02:45:34,060
在她周围说话，当她听得足够多时，她开始看到她说的模式

2250
02:45:34,060 --> 02:45:40,619
 words at first to the delight of her parents and then later on full sentences similarly during a

2250
02:45:34,060 --> 02:45:40,619
一开始是让她父母高兴的话语，后来是类似的完整句子。

2251
02:45:40,619 --> 02:45:46,140
 training period the language model is fed a mind-boggling amount of text to learn from mostly

2251
02:45:40,619 --> 02:45:46,140
训练期间，语言模型被输入大量令人难以置信的文本来学习

2252
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:51,820
 from internet sources it then plays guess the next word with all of this over and over again

2252
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:51,820
从互联网来源，然后它会一遍又一遍地猜测下一个单词

2253
02:45:51,820 --> 02:45:56,539
 and the parameters are automatically tweaked until it starts getting really good at predicting the

2253
02:45:51,820 --> 02:45:56,539
并且参数会自动调整，直到它开始真正擅长预测

2254
02:45:56,539 --> 02:46:02,300
 next word this is called backpropagation which is a fancy term for oh i guessed wrong i better change

2254
02:45:56,539 --> 02:46:02,300
下一个词这称为反向传播，这是一个奇特的术语，“哦，我猜错了，我最好改变一下”

2255
02:46:02,300 --> 02:46:08,220
 something however to become truly useful a model also needs to undergo human training this is called

2255
02:46:02,300 --> 02:46:08,220
然而，要变得真正有用​​，模型还需要接受人类训练，这称为

2256
02:46:08,220 --> 02:46:14,300
 reinforcement learning with human feedback and it involves thousands of hours of humans painstakingly

2256
02:46:08,220 --> 02:46:14,300
具有人类反馈的强化学习，需要人类花费数千小时的艰苦努力

2257
02:46:14,300 --> 02:46:19,820
 testing and evaluating output from the model and giving feedback kind of like training a dog with

2257
02:46:14,300 --> 02:46:19,820
测试和评估模型的输出并提供反馈，就像训练狗一样

2258
02:46:19,820 --> 02:46:25,580
 a clicker to reinforce good behavior that's why a model like gpt won't tell you how to rob a bank

2258
02:46:19,820 --> 02:46:25,580
一个强化良好行为的答题器，这就是为什么像 gpt 这样的模型不会告诉你如何抢劫银行

2259
02:46:25,580 --> 02:46:29,900
 it knows very well how to rob a bank but through human training it has learned that it shouldn't

2259
02:46:25,580 --> 02:46:29,900
它非常清楚如何抢劫银行，但通过人类训练，它知道它不应该

2260
02:46:29,900 --> 02:46:35,740
 help people commit crimes when training is done the model is mostly frozen other than some fine

2260
02:46:29,900 --> 02:46:35,740
训练完成后帮助人们犯罪，除了一些罚款外，模型大部分都被冻结

2261
02:46:35,740 --> 02:46:40,699
 tuning that can happen later that's what the p stands for in gpt pre-trained although in the

2261
02:46:35,740 --> 02:46:40,699
稍后可能会进行的调整，这就是 gpt 预训练中的 p 代表的意思，尽管在

2262
02:46:40,699 --> 02:46:45,100
 future we will probably have models that can learn continuously rather than just during training and

2262
02:46:40,699 --> 02:46:45,100
未来我们可能会拥有能够持续学习的模型，而不仅仅是在训练期间和

2263
02:46:45,100 --> 02:46:52,140
 fine tuning now although chat gpt kind of got the ball rolling gpt isn't the only model out there

2263
02:46:45,100 --> 02:46:52,140
现在正在微调，尽管聊天 gpt 有点让球滚动 gpt 不是唯一的模型

2264
02:46:52,140 --> 02:46:58,540
 in fact new models are sprouting like mushrooms they vary a lot in terms of speed capability and

2264
02:46:52,140 --> 02:46:58,540
事实上，新型号如雨后春笋般涌现，它们在速度能力和性能方面差异很大。

2265
02:46:58,540 --> 02:47:04,460
 cost some can be downloaded and run locally others are only online some are free or open source

2265
02:46:58,540 --> 02:47:04,460
有些可以下载并在本地运行，有些只能在线使用，有些是免费或开源的

2266
02:47:04,460 --> 02:47:09,580
 others are commercial products some are super easy to use while others require complicated

2266
02:47:04,460 --> 02:47:09,580
有些是商业产品，有些非常易于使用，而另一些则需要复杂的

2267
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:16,060
 technical setup some are specialized for certain use cases others are more general and can be used

2267
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:16,060
技术设置有些专门用于某些用例，其他则更通用并且可以使用

2268
02:47:16,060 --> 02:47:22,220
 for almost anything and some are baked into products in the form of co-pilots or chat windows

2268
02:47:16,060 --> 02:47:22,220
几乎适用于任何事物，有些以副驾驶或聊天窗口的形式融入到产品中

2269
02:47:22,940 --> 02:47:29,820
 it's it's the wild west just keep in mind that you generally get what you pay for so with a free

2269
02:47:22,940 --> 02:47:29,820
这是狂野的西部，请记住，你通常会得到你付出的代价，所以免费

2270
02:47:29,820 --> 02:47:35,500
 model you may just be getting a smart high school student in your basement rather than einstein

2270
02:47:29,820 --> 02:47:35,500
模型你可能只是在你的地下室里找到一个聪明的高中生而不是爱因斯坦

2271
02:47:36,300 --> 02:47:43,820
 the difference between for example gpt 3.5 and gpt 4 is massive note that there are different

2271
02:47:36,300 --> 02:47:43,820
例如，gpt 3.5 和 gpt 4 之间的差异是巨大的，请注意，有不同的

2272
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:48,700
 types of generative ai models that generate different types of content text-to-text models

2272
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:48,700
生成不同类型内容的文本到文本模型的生成人工智能模型的类型

2273
02:47:48,700 --> 02:47:55,020
 like gpt4 take text as input and generate text as output the text can be natural language but it can

2273
02:47:48,700 --> 02:47:55,020
像 gpt4 一样，将文本作为输入并生成文本作为输出，文本可以是自然语言，但也可以

2274
02:47:55,020 --> 02:48:01,020
 also be structured information like code and json or html i use this a lot myself to generate

2274
02:47:55,020 --> 02:48:01,020
也可以是结构化信息，例如代码和 json 或 html 我自己经常使用它来生成

2275
02:48:01,020 --> 02:48:04,540
 code when programming it saves an incredible amount of time and

2275
02:48:01,020 --> 02:48:04,540
编程时编写代码可以节省大量时间

2276
02:48:08,220 --> 02:48:13,340
 yeah so yeah i guess i'll probably stop here because i can see some students starting to

2276
02:48:08,220 --> 02:48:13,340
是的，所以是的，我想我可能会停在这里，因为我可以看到一些学生开始

2277
02:48:13,340 --> 02:48:19,260
 prepare to leave right okay so anyway it's quite an interesting video right you can actually go

2277
02:48:13,340 --> 02:48:19,260
准备离开吧好吧，无论如何，这是一个非常有趣的视频，你实际上可以走了

2278
02:48:19,260 --> 02:48:23,580
 and i provide the link you have go and i've looked uh just give me a few more seconds i'm

2278
02:48:19,260 --> 02:48:23,580
我提供了你已经去的链接，我已经看过了，呃，再给我几秒钟，我

2279
02:48:23,580 --> 02:48:30,300
 trying to finish this okay so in this lecture we cover the following topic okay see you

2279
02:48:23,580 --> 02:48:30,300
试图完成这个，好吧，所以在本次讲座中，我们将讨论以下主题，好的，再见
